          "To open Marines are heard singing 'I don't know but I've been told' while patrolling on a bridge. One of them says that he has heard a rumor about how other marines think that their base has gotten soft because they haven't seen action. Another vehemently argued that that is not true.\nMeanwhile a damaged marine warship was being fixed at a dock where workers were complaining that the ship would take a week to fix while another states that they had 3 days. In the background Mekao is seen drinking, muttering that in the old days people used to treat their ships with respect. He then gasped and dropped his bottle as he saw the Going Merry falling from the sky and shouted for everyone to look.\nThe ship is shown falling and Marines sounded the alarm saying that they are under attack from the sky. The Marines then get to their stations and then see the Going Merry and associate it with the Straw Hat Pirates.\nA lower ranking marine then goes and tells Lt. Commander Drake that pirates have invaded. He asks where Comm. Jonathan is, to which he replies he doesn't know.\nJonathan was then shown fishing Usopps's sniper goggles out of the water as he stared at the Going Merry while the Marines tell the Straw hats that resistance is futile and they can't escape.\nIn the kitchen, two cooks were talking about the commotion outside and get slapped with a ladle by the head chef Jessica who yelled at them for wasting time that they could be spent on preparing food for the soldiers at the base.\nJonathan was then shown walking into his office where Drake was waiting for him. Drake asked where he had been as Jonathan threw his fishing rod and hat into Drake's arms saying he didn't catch anything. Drake begins to tell him if he is absent all the time it causes problems, but was stopped by Jonathan. A marine comes to report that all the eyewitnesses claim they saw a ghost and that the ship must be a ghost ship. Drake berated the marine to report something of significance and to only come back with something useful.\nThe Marines started investigating the ship and Jonathan noticed odd things for a 'ghost ship' such as the tea being set out and the books being well kept. Then a marine informs him of treasure that they had found on board. A south bird makes its eerie noise to which Jonathan tells people to calm down as it is just a silly looking bird, to which the bird attacks him and flies away. He told his men to keep up the good work and to continue investigating the 'ghost ship'.\nJonathan, walking with other higher ranked marines, begins to connect the dots about the coffee flavor and color being similar to Jaya coffee, the gold on the ship and the legend of a gold city on Jaya, along with the South Bird saying that its not a ghost ship and that the other men were 'too green' to deal with the situation so he kept up the ghost ship idea. Drake offered to start a searching party which Jonathan immediately shuts down and says to begin searching at first light and warned them to check everyone as they could camouflage themselves to look like marines.\nChopper is shown hiding behind a tree wondering where everyone is. Zoro surfaces in the water and dodges an oncoming ship, while Nami is shown hiding her waver in a field of tall grass. Sanji, hiding in a tree, hopes that Nami and Robin are okay when a patrolling marine shoots at him, claiming he saw a light. As they walk away Sanji got mad saying he can't even smoke in peace to himself. Luffy is seen trying to pick a passage that will lead him to meat wishing he had Chopper with him to smell it for him. Usopp and Robin are shown together as Usopp finds his googles. Robin uses her Devil Fruit to spy on the marines who are talking about the ship being a ghost ship and how the gold must be cursed.\nJonathan, reclining in his office, is seen thinking about who is on board and what jobs they have.\nChopper, to get away from Marines, throws trash out a window to distract them. Nami is wondering where they landed and Robin tells Usopp the main priority is to find out how to escape. Luffy is then shown literally shadowing a marine while Sanji thinks about how stupid he is being and how he never takes things seriously.\nTo end Jonathan is shown wondering why the Straw Hats are at the base and that he will just have to wait and see."

          "The episode starts off with Sanji and Chopper sailing back to the merry after failing to find Robin. Sanji questions if Robin not returning has something to do with what Aokiji told them about Robin. They agree if she's ok she will eventually turn up at the Going Merry.\nThe episode shifts to Luffy and Nami who learn that the Merry is irreparable. Luffy and Nami refuse to accept it but they are informed that the \"keel\" of the ship has been damaged too bad to be repaired. (The keel is the bottom part of the boat; it holds the boat together and is basically its backbone.) Luffy and Nami ask if they can build an exact replica, but the carpenters say it's impossible because of the differences in wood type and material across islands. They will need an entirely new ship.\nGovernment officials show up to talk to Iceberg while Nami and Luffy hide. While carrying the suitcases Luffy realizes two are lighter. They open them up and see that 200 million beri is gone. Luffy swears to find the money and runs off in an unknown direction. Nami meanwhile asks where the Franky hideout is and heads in that direction.\nOne the way to the Franky hideout, Nami finds Usopp. It appears he has been beaten up and left on the sidewalk. He cries that he is the one responsible for letting the money slip away and is worried about facing the crew after screwing up. Nami tells him the hideout isn't far away and tells him to stay put. She has to return the money to the Merry first before getting Usopp help. The scene cuts to the Franky family celebrating such a big heist. As they celebrate the door blows up, and behind it is Usopp with his sling shot."

Usopp is enraged by this, which prompts Luffy to clarify that it is impossible to repair the Merry with the damage she has sustained. Usopp refuses to accept this and thinks that Luffy has abandoned the Merry. The two get into a fight which eventually prompts Usopp to leave the crew. This was not only due to the current situation, but a culmination of Usopp's insecurity that he was too weak to be a part of the Straw Hat Pirates. This ends with Usopp challenging Luffy to a duel for the rights to the Merry.\nLater that night, Nami tries to dissuade Luffy from fighting with Usopp. This is unsuccessful and Luffy still wishes to fight Usopp. Chopper tries to heal Usopp, but he also refuses.

With the Straw Hat Pirates being low on food supplies, they are all starving, wondering if they are going to starve to death. A huge fog appears, which Nami believes can be used to their advantage to escape from the Marines. The Marine ships starts crashing into each other as they are hitting the barely visible rocks on the surface which just appeared after the fog. Chief Petty Officer Minchey orders his men to turn back because of the danger for the Marines. As the Straw Hat Pirates pass the thick fog and the rocks they see an uncharted island, hoping to find food on it. An old man is sighted with his binocular, counting the Straw Hat Pirates as six humans and an animal.\nAs the Straw Hat Pirates walk up from the shore, they spot a young goat, directly clarifying it as food. As they try to hunt it down, Nami stops them, stating that it shouldn't be eaten. Suddenly, a mob of angry full-grown goats have surrounded the Straw Hat Pirates. When the goats start attacking, Zoro brings out his sword, indicating that he will kill them but Chopper tells him not to due to the fact that they aren't bad, thanks to his ability to speak with animals. Chopper is trying to reason with the goats and finds out that someone ordered the goats to attack. Suddenly, an old man falls out of a tree pointing out the now transformed Chopper as a monster. They found out that this is the man who ordered the goats to attack.\nThe old man passes out, from the fear of being cut by Zoro's blade as he is trying to free him from the branches that he has gotten stuck in. They take him to his shed, where Chopper is getting him treated. As the old man is craving them to repay him for what they have done, Luffy finally says to help him out. On Zoro's hunt for food he finds a strange pirate ship, which he later in the evening tells the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates about after he returned with fruits as food. They all go to the ship to investigate it further. Nami states that he was once a pirate who is trying to escape the island with that pirate ship, which is more of a wreck than a ship. She also believes he has a hidden treasure somewhere on the island.\nMeanwhile, at Marine Captain Moore's base, Captain Moore tells Minchey to organize a landing party and to locate and eliminate the Straw Hat Pirates. On the island, Chopper find out that the old man has less than three days to live, due to a disease. Therefore, the next day, Sanji is making him a big dinner because of the few days he has left so that he can enjoy his last moments. At the Marine Base, they find out that the old man's name is Zenny and that he was washed ashore on the island 20 years ago with his believed huge treasure."

Bellamy begs Doflamingo to give him another chance, but Doflamingo concludes that Bellamy and his crew are obsolete to him and uses his puppetry to force Sarquiss to slash Bellamy, although he survives.

The crew then come across Long Ring Long Land, however it is too plain for their (particularly Sanji's) tastes.

Suddenly the bamboos start moving and one hits Luffy. Luffy gets excited and breaks the bamboo. Then falls an old man named Tonjit who has a horse named Shelly. Tonjit says that he made the world's tallest stilts and after going up, he couldn't come down for 10 years due to fear. Tonjit explains that due to expanse grassland, everyone here is relaxed making them long. After roaming around Long Ring Long Land the damaged Going Merry is seized by another ship as its captain confronts the crew and challenges them to a Davy Back Fight."

          "The Straw Hat Pirates are busy repairing the wrecked ship and Zoro is busy chopping down trees by axe. The chopped wood is then being passed on by goats to each other towards Chopper. While carrying the chopped wood, Zenny makes exclamations about the slow work of the Straw Hat crew. To calm him, Nami makes Zenny sit on a chair and Robin offers a shoulder massage. Sanji asks him about why the ship is on the top of the mountain to which he says that this ship is his coffin. The Straw Hats are astonished and ask him if it is too early to have a coffin. He replies by saying he will be needing a coffin anyway eventually. Sanji asks him why his coffin is a pirate ship and Zenny starts dozing off, but the Straw Hat Pirates think that he has died and start shouting to which Nami points them to be quiet as he is only dozing off.\nAt a Marine base, Marines learn that both the Straw Hats and Zenny are at the same island. Keeping in mind the bounties of Luffy and Zoro, Sergeant Minchey suggests a plan to assure victory.\nAt the island, Zenny is playing chess with Nami and he is getting all the services from massages to delicious cheese. Luffy, Usopp, and Zoro return with caught fish for dinner and assure Zenny of any services he asks for. Zenny exclaims how he is living a paradise. Zoro thinks about it and says that he should have died by now as three days have already passed. The Straw Hats think of leaving the island as Zenny seems in better health than when they arrived.\nNami keeps on losing to Zenny in chess and in the hope of getting details about the treasure, she bets everything including the ship. Consequently, they owe him service for 10 more years to get their ship back. Usopp suggests bolting out but Luffy refuses, saying a bet is a promise and he will not break any promises. During all the ruckus going on about leaving, Robin checkmates Zenny and wins the ship back. Being delighted on meeting such joyful prates, Zenny decides to have a party.\nAt the party, Nami tries to get the old man drunk to learn about the true location of the treasure to which he jokes about the goats being his real treasure. Later, he says he was a money lender to pirates and was known as the money lender Zenny. This revelation came as a surprise to Usopp as pirates don't usually return the money they take. He talks about how the pirates were not returning the loaned money, so he always went face to face with them to get his money back.\nRecalling his past, Zenny was on a ship and was asking for his money back or else he would sink the ship by bombing it.\nAfter talking about his past, he talks about his dream of becoming the Pirate King and how his ship got destroyed by pirates 20 years ago causing him to drift to this island. He thought of building a ship but wasn't able to bring the wood beside the sea, so he built his ship on the mountains. By the time he had completed the ship, he had gotten too old to sail the Grand Line. However, Luffy suggests that no one is too old to become the Pirate King.\nThe Marines are on their way and are thinking of luring the Straw Hat Pirates out of the island while Zenny is thinking about what Luffy said to him.\nWhen morning comes, Chopper exclaims about seeing the Marine ship and the Straw Hats start running to the shore and are confronted by Sergeant Minchey. He says he came with only one ship just to inspect the island and Zenny and the Straw Hat Pirates should leave immediately as other Marines might come for them. In reality, a huge Marine fleet is hiding in the fog behind them so that they can attack the pirates when they leave. The Straw Hats easily look through this trick and get ready to attack but are stopped as Usopp is captured and are asked to drop their weapons. They do as they are told, and the Marines now try to shoot at them and at the same time, Zenny unloads his ship from the mountain top."

          "Luffy is cast at sea in a barrel. Sailors on a passing cruise ship retrieve the barrel, but the ship is attacked with cannon fire by a nearby pirate ship, led by Alvida. The barrel is sent rolling into the kitchen. Once the cruise ship's sails have been destroyed, the Alvida Pirates board the ship to plunder its goods, and Alvida also forces one of her chore boys, Koby, to board the ship. Meanwhile, a girl takes advantage of the opportunity and sneaks aboard the Alvida Pirates' ship to steal its treasures.\nKoby and other pirates notice the barrel in the kitchen and find Luffy inside, who was sleeping. After Luffy defeats the hostile pirates, he goes with Koby to the pantry to eat the stored food. Luffy explains that he set sail to begin his pirating career, but his dinghy was destroyed by a whirlpool and he was left trapped at sea in a barrel. Koby explains that he was riding on a rowboat, but was kidnapped by the Alvida Pirates and forced to become a chore boy. He explains his desires to escape the Alvida Pirates some day and join the Marines.\nAlvida is informed of Luffy's presence, and, out of suspicion that he could be a bounty hunter, confronts him and Koby in the pantry. This triggers a battle on the ship, but Luffy defeats the pirates. Although Alvida is armed with a large spiked club, her attacks are rendered ineffective, as Luffy ate a Devil Fruit, granting him a superhuman ability that gives his body rubber-like properties. Using a Gomu Gomu no Pistol attack, Luffy defeats Alvida, sending her flying off the ship and into the sea.\nHaving concluded the battle, Luffy boards a dinghy with Koby to continue his travels, catching a glimpse of the female burglar who was also departing the ship on her own dinghy. Luffy aims towards the Grand Line to search for the One Piece treasure but first looks to recruit the infamous Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro into his crew."

          "The episode starts with a scene in which the Pumpkin Pirates went swimming when suddenly Rapanui Pasqua told them that the treasure of the island is on the top of the rock where their flag stands. When all of them swam very quickly, Henzo was left behind trying to tell them to wait. Rapanui Pasqua turned back and shouted he can't because he is an adult. Henzo's body suddenly turned to the present old appearance he has and the background went hallucinating until Henzo woke up and realized it was all just a dream. Nico Robin saw him awake and figured out that he was dreaming about his friends because he was shouting their names while asleep.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and the others are on the outside and Zoro asked Luffy if they are travelling in the right direction. They soon realized they once again passed a statue that they already passed a while ago, they thought they were travelling in circles but in shooting a cannon made all of them realize the space was distorted. Luffy obviously didn't know what it meant so he dared to test it by flying forward to the sky and then came falling back from behind the ship. Luffy told them he gets it and said that it was a \"Mystery Mist\", obviously not understanding it himself. None of the crew knew how to get out of Ape's Concert, so Robin suggested to ask a boy hiding behind some wreckage, how they might get out by going to the Pumpkin Pirates hideout.\nIn a Marine ship wreckage, Ian is seen eating in a prison cell with Rongo and Akibi talking to him about how to get out of Ape's Concert as well. Ian tries to convince them that he knows how to get out of Ape's Concert but they should give him the key to his cell first. Isoka knew he was lying and reminded the two how cruel he was to them by forcing them to let him be their leader when previously a Sea King was attacking them he was so afraid that he threw Rongo to fight it. Nearly eaten, Rongo was rescued by Rapanui and after the attack, Ian boasts that they wouldn't be alive if it weren't for him. Their ship got lost because the Sea King smelled the food they kept and they were left on a small boat. In the Marine ship, the buzzer rang and Isoka asked Rapanui what's the danger. Rapanui saw a pirate ship and managed to see Pukau thinking he is being held hostage.\nRapanui immediately went to rescue him and threatened Luffy and the others by swaying his sword until Zoro threw it out. Pukau told Rapanui that he was not a hostage and that they just asked him where their secret hideout is. Rapanui wouldn't believe when Usopp went out holding plates of food attracting both Luffy and Pukau until all of them except Rapanui started eating. In an attempt to offer food, Henzo was denied by Rapanui because he doesn't believe in adults who suddenly appear. Henzo asked for forgiveness because he worked hard to find them but now they are of different ages. Henzo's Den Den Mushi started ringing but Luffy grabbed it and answered it receiving Wetton's voice. On the other side, Sanji grabbed the Den Den Mushi from Wetton and asked if it was Luffy. Upon discovering they talked to each other, Henzo knew the Rainbow Mist and the Outside World wass connected.\nHenzo got the phone back and when Rapanui heard Wetton's name he told Henzo that he was not the true Henzo they knew. He said that true Pumpkin Pirates don't work for Wetton. When Nami, Chopper and Sanji decided to go to the Rainbow Mist, Wetton forbid it and said they must pay 10,000,000 beli to be able to be permitted. They didn't want to pay so Wetton told them they would instead work hard labor in the Rainbow tower until their deaths. Nami asked for the safety device and Lake, gullible enough, gave it up and they started running. While Sanji wished that it would be a romantic getaway, Nami's desire for the treasures made her eyes turn into Beli symbol. The 2 prepared to fight when suddenly a Sea King appeared before them and Nami  screamed \"What?\" ending the episode."

          "Usopp is finally reconciled with the Straw Hat Pirates and has been pulled on-board their new ship. But they remain under attack from Vice Admiral Garp. Franky orders Zoro to furl up the sails so he can fire up a secret escape mechanism.\nBut before they get underway, Franky insists they name the ship first. Luffy comes up with a bunch of odd, unsuitable animal combinations. Franky says the name should be based on the masthead, which is shaped vaguely like a lion's head, though most at Galley-La Company \"mistook\" it for a sunflower. Iceburg and Franky agreed that it was suitable for the future ship of the Pirate King. Iceburg is inspired, envisioning a ship that can brightly cross a thousand seas like the Sun. He therefore suggested the name Thousand Sunny. The crew ignores Franky's lion-based name idea and go with Iceburg's idea instead.\nFranky goes below deck to power up his escape device, remarking that Water 7 will disappear from view momentarily. Luffy calls out to his grandfather and says they are leaving now. He says his goodbye to Koby, but still doesn't know Helmeppo's name. He whacks away one last cannonball from Garp telling him it's no use which infuriates Garp who has to be held back by Helmeppo. Luffy then proclaims his thanks to Iceburg, Galley-La and the Franky Family, but he's too far away for them to hear him. Garp then gets out a comically-enormous cannonball and swings it at the Thousand Sunny. Just as the crew think they're all going to die, Franky's \"Miracle Emergency Acceleration Device\" fires: Coup de Burst! Powered by three barrels of cola, the Thousand Sunny launches into the air suddenly, getting away.\nEveryone on Garp's ship is surprised, even Aokiji. Garp almost looks pleased at his grandson's escape, and starts laughing remarking \"Not bad Luffy.\" As the Straw Hats sail off in the sky, Usopp remembers the flying sensation from when the Going Merry flew up the Knock Up Stream to Skypiea. Franky boasts that the soul of the Going Merry lives on in the Thousand Sunny. There's not a thing that Merry could do that the new ship cannot. Back at Water 7, Oimo and Kashii are seen assisting the rebuilding process. The Franky Family frets a bit because they're out of food, but Iceburg comes to their aid, giving them jobs at Galley-La. Word begins to spread about the new bounties for the Straw Hats. Smoker gets the new wanted posters from Tashigi after a pirate bust. He says other pirates will start to defer to the Straw Hats now, and vows he will crush Luffy when they reach the New World.\nOn the Baratie, Zeff immediately recognizes the terrible composite sketch made of Sanji. His former fellow chefs all laugh at it. Regardless, his poster replaces Luffy's at the center of the restaurant, and they use it as a selling point, that the restaurant is Sanji's home. Back at Foosha Village, the villagers once more rejoice at Luffy's growing infamy. Woop Slap is again annoyed by the raucous partying. Makino likes his crew, especially his \"cute pet\". Woop Slap is annoyed that an enemy of the World Government came from Foosha, and wonders what Garp is doing about it. He also wonders if Dadan knows about Luffy's recent actions. At Syrup Village, the Usopp Pirates and Kaya instantly recognize Sogeking as Usopp. The rest of the village doesn't believe it, however. Kaya goes back to her medical studies so she can be ready if Usopp needs to be healed if/when he returns. The boys say they'll beat Usopp up if he ever hurts Kaya.\nAt Shimotsuki Village, Koushirou admits to his pupils that he taught Zoro how to fight, but swears he didn't teach Zoro how to be a pirate. Now all the kids want to be pirates in addition to great fighters. He doesn't mind too much, as long as Zoro keeps kendo at his heart. At Cocoyashi Village, Genzo is irate at Nami's wanted poster, yet has it blown up behind his desk. Nojiko sates him by pointing out Nami's expression, saying it's proof that Luffy has indeed not taken away her smile. At the Sakura Kingdom, Dalton calls Dr. Kureha down from her castle, and shows her the latest wanted posters for the Straw Hats. Dalton is certain the Marines are mistaken about Chopper's measly 50 bounty. Dr. Kureha is just happy that she gets to see him again.\nAt Arabasta, Igaram, Chaka, Pell and King Cobra are shocked that Nico Robin, \"Miss All Sunday\" of Baroque Works, is now affiliated with the Straw Hats. They are concerned that Vivi will not take this news well, but she already knows, and doesn't care. She trusts Luffy's decisions even if nobody ever understands his motives. Yet again, they are surprised by the princess' maturity. At Baltigo, a yet-unseen island on the Grand Line, the Revolutionary Army discusses a successful coup at Centaurea in South Blue. Their leader, \"Revolutionary\" Dragon, sees the stack of wanted posters for the Straw Hats. It's noted that the Marines made the entire crew wanted due to the events at Enies Lobby. His associates mention Luffy's relation to Garp, apparently unaware of their leader's relation to both men. Dragon believes his son's exploits will get more people to question the World Government, and welcomes the day when they will finally meet. Back on the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats celebrate the returns of Usopp and Robin; their new shipwright, Franky; and their new ship."

Buggy and the prisoners celebrate their escape while the Newkama patiently wait for Inazuma's recovery as advised by Ivankov. Meanwhile, Luffy and Mr. 3 look across the ocean while crying and talking about Mr. 2. A few other Newkama join their sentiment. Buggy approaches them and encourages them to celebrate their freedom. He tactlessly suggests that they could make it a funeral for Mr. 2 which earns him a punch from Luffy, the latter stating that they aren't sure if Mr. 2's had died. They banter before Luffy punches Buggy once more and climbs towards the helm where Jinbe is steering.\nThe fishman thanks Luffy for giving him a chance to save Ace. Buggy follows Luffy and they continue quarreling while Jinbe formally introduces himself to Luffy, mentioning that he is currently a Warlord of the Sea who is ready to resign from the position. He confidently announces that they should unleash Hell at the Marine headquarters and save Ace so Mr. 2's effort will not be wasted. Both Buggy and Luffy scream and fall from surprise upon hearing the statement. The prisoners and the Newkama approach upon hearing their exclamation. Luffy announces his surprise from the fact that Jinbe is a Warlord which prompts the said Warlord to apologize for the delayed introduction. Meanwhile, Buggy is mortified upon hearing that their destination is the Marine headquarters. Jinbe confirms this while Crocodile explains that the ship is currently riding the government-exclusive Tarai Current and their only possible destinations are Enies Lobby or the Marine Headquarters. He reveals that the only reason they escaped is to join the impending war. Both Buggy and Mr. 3 clutch Jinbe, asking him to stop the ship while the prisoners cry out in despair. An okama states that everyone from Newkama land knew about this. Out of nowhere, they hear the sound of a Den Den Mushi ringing which piques everyone's attention. They locate it inside the ship's mast and Luffy picks it up. The Marine officer on the line announces that they have identified the two main perpetrators for the break-out: Luffy and Buggy. The escapees are surprised that Buggy gets priority over the Warlord of the Sea. The Marine continues speaking, revealing Buggy's past as a crew member of the Roger Pirates as well as his connection to Shanks. The Marine officer states that they have yet to find a reason but concludes that he must have the same goal as Luffy: to save Ace. Trying to discourage the escapees from continuing, he adds that the Gates of Justice to Marine Headquarters will not open for pirates so there would be no escape. Luffy angrily declares that he will save Ace before slamming down the receiver."

The announcer then calls out that the Block A battle royale is over and that the champion is a large man with a paper bag over his head. To the spectacle of the entire Colosseum, the man removes the bag and reveals himself to be Jesus Burgess, the captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, who gestures and cheers over the broken bodies of his defeated opponents.\nMeanwhile, the Thunder Soldier takes Franky to a private place so they can discuss Franky's 'job'.

Luffy then asks why is everyone almost naked, to which the prince explains that the spectators want to see blood and that in the arena you can see humanity's true colors exposed.\nThe prince then asks Luffy who he is. Luffy tells him his real name and exclaims that he is going to be the Pirate King, drawing attention from the crowd. However, they see that his name tag states Lucy and assume he mispronounced his own name. The prince laughs and says that if he really was Luffy, he would take his head here and now, because when he came to the New World about three years ago he made a big name for himself but his fame was overshadowed by the Battle of Marineford, the Eleven Supernovas and the Blackbeard Pirates. Thus, he carries a grudge against any who is in \"the Worst Generation\".\nHe then is ignored again by Luffy, who notices a statue and his resemblance to it in his armor. Rebecca, a female gladiator, tells Luffy that it is a statue of Kyros, the mightiest gladiator in the history of the Corrida Colosseum, stating that he won 3000 consecutive matches and that he only took a single blow throughout them all, but that he retired 20 years ago and that no one knows his true identity. She wonders if he truly existed and how the bronze statue appeared one day out of the blue. She then declares her intention of winning the Mera Mera no Mi and killing Doflamingo. The announcer proclaims that the first block battle royale is over and the winner is revealed to be Jesus Burgess, the captain of the first ship of Blackbeard's crew.\nSeeing this, Franky begins to rethink if Luffy would have an easy time in the tournament and realizes he is in for a struggle. Thunder Soldier then takes Franky to a private place so they can discuss Franky's 'job'.\nAn unknown Marine starts to panic, stating that they need reinforcements because the competitors' power surpassed his expectations. The adviser of the Barto Club, the Missionary Gambia, gets on the bad side of Vice Admiral Maynard, who is there undercover as a competitor, and gets taken out. At this point we see Bartolomeo watching from the shadows.\nIt is time for the Block B battle royal and the announcer shouts that it is time to let the athletes in. The blind man and a young Marine leave the Colosseum and discuss what they plan to do about the current situation. It is then that the blind man wears his admiral coat and is revealed to be the famous Marine Admiral Fujitora. Before Block B starts, Luffy is confronted by Bellamy."

The Straw Hat group begins to beat them up and begin to check Dr. Hogback's home. A person carrying a torch approaches the beaten zombies.\nWhile walking through the forest, Zoro and Sanji get into another argument when another zombie comes in awe of their power. This zombie informs the group of a major threat who stole the zombie shadows, Gecko Moria the most terrifying on the island. This catches Robin's ears as his bounty's much higher than Luffy's and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

As Luffy prepares to leave, he hopes his crew are still alive and that's all that matters. He also thinks of the horror that Kuma put him through and prepares to get stronger. He almost hand-walks off the island, but then asks for a ship. Marguerite reminds him the island is on a Calm Belt. As such, sailors will not make it to the island. Her leader's flagship, the Yuda is charioted by two large snakes. Luffy insists on making a raft to make it to Sabaody Archipelago, but it breaks beneath his weight. This prompts Marguerite to get him out of the water. She begins to think that men will sink like rocks. Angered, Marguerite worries she'll become attached to Luffy and fires some arrows, which the Straw Hat captain dodges. He realizes the arrows can be powerful enough to pierce rock. Marguerite points out the arrows are imbued with Haki. Just then, Kikyo and the others give chase. Sweet Pea informs Marguerite that the leader will be coming soon. Meanwhile, a group of Kuja pirates argue with some marines over a dead sea king. The agreement between the Kuja and the World Government forbids the Marines from going within 3 kilometers of the island. Momonga tells of how he encountered the Sea King and how he was impatient with meeting the woman pirate. The marines bullets were anemic against the Sea King, but then Momonga breached the monster's mouth and killed it from the inside out with an x-shaped opening.\nMomonga then grows more impatient and demands Boa Hancock's presence. Some of the pirates tell him to leave. Momonga then points out that Hancock is to attend the public execution of Portgas D. Ace and will not take no for an answer. If rejected, Hancock will be stripped of her title as Shichibukai, leaving the Kuja as ordinary pirates. Suddenly, footsteps are heard within the Yuda. Boa Hancock comes out to the deck complaining about a kitten blocking her way. One of the Kuja takes responsibility for her crime. Momonga then advises the guard be kept up as Hancock can be very frightening and beautiful. Meanwhile, Luffy continues fleeing from the Kuja warriors wishing Nami were with him. Desperate, Luffy climbs a tree and hops through the jungle. Kikyo then becomes determined to kill Luffy before Hancock arrives. The young Straw Hat captain almost climbs a rock wall, but is knocked into the jungle by an arrow. Hancock and her sisters stand before Momonga,, but refuse to go to war with Momonga, wanting to retain her status. She also demands the cargo from Momonga's ship. The vice-admiral tries to defy her, but the marines begin to comply. With the execution one week away at Marineford, Whitebeard will try to rescue Ace. The entire Marine Headquarters would need every moment to prepare.\nThe Kuja leader still refuses to give in and one of the marines had an accident, being turned into stone. The marines learned that one of their ships had an entire crew turned to stone with loving looks on their faces. Sandersonia and Marigold point out how their sister gets her way. No matter what anyone does, Hancock says she is beautiful. The Kuja and Marines cheer, then Hancock fires a Love Love Mellow, shooting energetic hearts at the aroused Marines, turning them into statues. Momonga is horrified and angered with a knife in his hand. He also says one is not zero. The Kuja enjoy their loot and Hancock sets course for Amazon Lily. Determined, Momonga then orders that if she does not come back in two days, she will be stripped of her title. Hancock then dares him to do what he likes."

          "The Heart Pirates are still fighting off the remaining Marines at the auction house, tearing through them to escape. However, they come across the Kid Pirates, most of whom are already wounded due to Kuma. The Shichibukai immediately identifies and attacks Law, but Law manages to dodge the attack. With the Marines starting to close in from behind, Kid and Law, despite their mutual dislike of each other, tell Kuma they are leaving and prepare to face him. In Grove 8, Peterman has been thrashed by the Straw Hats and the Rosy Life Riders for his earlier abduction of Camie. After giving back Camie's backpack, they depart promising to aid them 'till they leave the island. The Straw Hats then head back to Shakky's Bar to treat Hachi's gun wound.\nAs they do so, they talk with Rayleigh where he reveals his relation to Gol D. Roger, much to their surprise (Hachi apparently knew this too, but did not tell them since they just needed a coater). Rayleigh also reveals how he met Hachi (the Fish-Man had saved Rayleigh's life when he was a kid, and they had remained friends 'till Hachi joined Arlong's crew, then named the Sun Pirates). Sanji then questions how he could still be alive if Roger's crew was captured, to which Rayleigh reveals that Roger actually turned himself in. The government just made it seem that way to show their strength to the public. Rayleigh goes on to tell them the reason why. It was because four years before he was executed, Roger was diagnosed with an incurable disease. His crew, however, had come across Crocus at the entrance of the Grand Line and asked him to join them on Roger's final journey to keep his disease in check.\nFinally, after three years, they had managed to conquer the Grand Line. This surprises the Straw Hats, Brook especially, since Crocus did reveal to them he was a pirate doctor for a time. Rayleigh even tells them that the reason Crocus joined was to find a certain pirate crew, which the Straw Hats figure must have been the Rumbar Pirates, bringing tears to Brook's eyes sockets. Rayleigh continues, stating that after they conquered the sea, Roger was dubbed the Pirate King. However, the title was meaningless since he was about to die. But Roger enjoyed it anyway, as he was a man who loved doing everything in grand style. Eventually, Roger disbanded his crew who silently went their separate ways, fates unknown.\nOne year later, Roger turned himself in to the Marines who decided to make a public execution of him to throw fear into pirates around the world. However, Roger had other plans; his last words to Rayleigh being \"I ain't gonna die, partner\". On the fateful day of his execution, Roger made his famous speech to the world which, in turn, created the current age of piracy. The Straw Hats are astonished by the story. Rayleigh then tells the group about Shanks and Buggy's apprenticeship aboard Roger's ship, the former of which ran into Rayleigh ten years earlier and told Rayleigh about Luffy, claiming that he had met a kid that said the same things as their captain did.\nThe story suddenly shifts to a harbor at Grove 27, where a pirate crew is about to set off. Before they can do so, they spot a ship on the horizon that suddenly fires a cannonball with a person actually standing on top of it. The ball lands in the harbor amidst the pirates and the figure, revealed to be Kizaru, awaits orders from his Den Den Mushi.\nBack at Shakky's Bar, Rayleigh congratulates Luffy for making it this far into the Grand Line and offers to do the coating job for free, much to the Straw Hats' pleasure. Robin then asks him about the Void Century, telling Rayleigh about a note written by Roger in the Poneglyph in Skypiea. Rayleigh replies that the Roger Pirates did indeed find out the whole history, though he advises her to continue looking for it on her own. Rayleigh says that maybe she could reach different conclusions than those that they reached. Still, he offers to reveal it to her but Robin politely turns him down, agreeing with his earlier advice. Rayleigh also reveals that Roger could not decipher everything like the genius Clover or the other scholars from Ohara. Roger just \"could hear the voice of all things\". Usopp then asks Robin if she would want to let an opportunity like this get away and starts to question Rayleigh about One Piece. Luffy stops him however, demanding that the mystery of the treasure remain hidden since countless pirates were risking their lives just to search for it. He then threatens to quit being a pirate if any of the crew asked Rayleigh about it, stating \"I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A BORING ADVENTURE LIKE THAT!!!\".\nUsopp apologizes for his actions before Rayleigh asks Luffy if he can really conquer the Grand Line. Luffy replies that he does not really intend to conquer it, only that the person with the most freedom in the ocean would be the Pirate King, which brings a smile to Rayleigh and Shakky's faces. Rayleigh then tells the crew he will have their ship coated in three days which, until then, the crew will have to avoid trouble. Thus, the Straw Hats decide their best bet is to split up and draw attention away from the shop. Shakky gives each member a Vivre Card so they can find their way back to Rayleigh once the coating is finished and Rayleigh decides to move the Thousand Sunny to a safer location. With that, they bid Hachi, Camie, Pappag, and Shakky farewell for the time being and head back into the groves. Luffy suggests to hide in the theme park though the others (save for Chopper and Brook) reject this idea.\nHowever, the Marines are already hot on the heels of the Straw Hat Pirates. At Grove 27, a warship approaches, causing a panic. As it prepares to make landfall, it fires off a round of cannonballs. Riding atop one, Admiral Kizaru descends on the grove in a frightening explosion and terrifies all the nearby pirates of the lawless area in the vicinity by his arrival. Kizaru announces his arrival on the Sabaody Archipelago back to Marine Headquarters through a Black Den Den Mushi on his wrist and requests a response."

          "At the Corrida Colosseum, Gatz is heard announcing how Kelly Funk easily took down Boo with his sudden increase in strength. Sai is seen kneeling down to his fallen comarde while Ideo is seen taking out opponents with his explosive punches. Don Chinjao knocks away opponents in a fit of anger while Luffy (as Lucy) is trying to get his helmet back from Jean the Bandit. Chinjao is still chasing after Luffy wanting to get revenge on Garp's grandson and Jean overhears this now knowing Lucy is indeed \"Straw Hat Luffy\". Luffy still chases after Jean and Jean says that he is a bandit and he never returns anything he steals. Luffy almost loses his beard and Jean tries to uncover Luffy more now knowing who Luffy is. Jean starts to attack Luffy by throwing weapons at him but Luffy dodges them all. However, Luffy loses sight of Jean and Jean is seen thinking to himself on how he will win by collecting all of the weapons in the colosseum.\nNumerous of competitors are seen getting knocked out of the arena and it turns out to be by Kelly Funk who is using a barrage of punches to send them flying (Rarara Rambo). Gatz wonders where Bobby went and is surprised to see that Kelly has both increased in size and power. A competitor on the ground remembers what happened and a brief flashback is shown where Bobby actually puts on Kelly as a jacket. Kelly then reveals that he ate the Jake Jake no Mi making him a Jacket Human and is able to put his body on the much stronger Bobby to make himself stronger. This was shown how Kelly easily took down Boo. Sai then confronts Kelly saying even though he thinks of Boo as a weaker individual, he is still his subordinate. Kelly attempts to attack Sai with his Rarara Rambo move again but Sai blocks each punch and easily takes down Kelly with a vicious kick. The entire crowd is shocked but pleased at what just happened. Suddenly, Sai is confronted by Ideo who is eager to fight against the strongest man in the colosseum and the two begin to clash.\nJust outside Dressrosa, Nami with Momonosuke is seen driving away from Donquixote Pirates on their submarine. Giolla, still on the Thousand Sunny still tells the Straw Hat Pirates to give up. She says that thanks to her Ato Ato no Mi power, she has turned their ship into a work of art and is not able to leave Dressrosa.  Giolla demands them to hand over Momonosuke but, meanwhile, the other Donquixote Pirates wonder where Brook and Chopper went to. Brook and Chopper suddenly appear next to the Donquixote Pirates on their own submarine. Suddenly, weather eggs appear from the sea and hover high above and Nami uses Thunder Breed Tempo to completely destroy the Donquixote Pirates' submarine angering Giolla. Nami then says that no matter how bad the suitation is, they will never leave the Thousand Sunny behind. Nami then tells Brook and Chopper to fight but they both comment they cannot fight in their current form and Brook calls out to Luffy. Back at the Corrida Colosseum, Luffy is seen to be in shocked as Jean the Bandit as collected a large mass of weapons. Jean then challenges Luffy to a battle.\nLuffy, knowing he cannot do anything else to hide his identity from Jean, attempts to get his helmet back but Jean tosses weapons at him that miss Luffy but hits the other competitors. Jean continues to toss weapons at Luffy while thanking Luffy for helping him make so much money over the past two years. Luffy (who is dodging all of the weapon throws) is confused by Jean's claims and Jean says he managed to turn over almost all of the prisoners that broke out of Impel Down. Jean says he still intends on turning in Buggy, Jinbe, Crocodile, Ivankov, and Shiryu, intending to make a name for himself. Luffy wonders how Jinbe and Ivankov are doing while Jean continues saying he'll even turn over those that escaped from Level 6 of Impel Down. Jean is surprised that he hasn't managed to hit Luffy yet and continues to throw weapons, this time, with his eyes close. However, when he runs out of weapons, it turns out that some of them got stuck to Chinjao. Jean is horrified at what just happended and an angry Chinjao takes out Jean with a headbutt, eliminating him from the competiton (with Luffy taking back his helmet before Jean was knocked away).\nMeanwhile, Ideo and Sai are seen clashing and are evenly matched. Gatz and the crowd are excited to see two warriors battling it out on equal terms. Chinjao is seen finally confronting Luffy, wanting to exact his revenge on Garp by killing his grandson. Luffy still is confused at Chinjao's claims but Chinjao says that killing Garp will be too easy on him and to kill someone he loves will be even greater. Cavendish is seen yelling about not being able to compete in Block C in order to kill Luffy while Bartolomeo looks on. Luffy, seeing no other choice, enters Gear 2 and prepares to fight Chinjao. Luffy says that even if it's not a personal matter, he has to win the tournment so that he will win the Mera Mera no Mi as he does not want anyone else to have Ace's Devil Fruit. Both Luffy and Chinjao charge in, harden their arms with Armament Haki and clash. The force of the punches are so great that it emits a shockwave, knocking away all of the competitors and some of the crowd members. Diamante comments on Luffy and Chinjao are both Haki users and Gatz announces that they are the final two of Block C."

Zoro argues that Sanji wanted to take the shortcut, but the cook fires back that they all agreed to go. Brook remembers the shadows he saw before they fell unconscious. Zoro argues that no one was there while Sanji disagrees. There is a flashback to an hour ago, when the group finds the footprints. Brook calls Zoro and Sanji over to look at the giant footprints. He thinks they might belong to the legendary yeti. Zoro and Sanji tell him to not be ridiculous. Brook gets excited, stating that beyond here lies the dream of man as all three imagine what the yeti looks like. They follow the footprints to the edge of a cliff, turn around, and see two large shadows and hear the sound of guns getting cocked. The Yeti Cool Brothers shoot them with the KYP bullets. Rock explains that the gas can put even the heaviest drinker into a complete stupor. He also tells them about section F-16, home of the icicle pincushion. They blast the tip of the cliff off with their rifles, sending the inebriated pirates with it. Zoro, in his last moments of consciousness, manages to cut the plateau containing the icicles, saving himself and the others.\nIn area F-16, a collection team discovers the three unconscious bodies. Sanji grabs the leg of one of the soldiers, surprising him. He surprises the soldiers even further by completely defeating the whole group. He realizes that he has to be careful, as Nami's body is far more delicate than his own. He then punches Zoro and Brook in the head to wake them up. Sanji asks Brook if he thinks the samurai is nearby. Brook says he remembers seeing the torso around here. The crew steps on a body unconscious in the snow; first Sanji, then Brook, and then Zoro notices the body and realizes it is the samurai. He is completely frozen. Sanji stomps on the Samurai's head, breaking the ice. The samurai gasps for air. He tells them that he suddenly became paralyzed. He says he is not cold, but Sanji calls him out on his lie. He explains that his ability prevents him from swimming and right now it feels like his torso is under water. Zoro and Brook reason that the torso fell in the salt water lake. Zoro concludes that if he can still feel it, then the sharks have not eaten the torso yet. Sanji realizes they do not have much time and they need to recover the samurai's torso. The samurai is surprised by this kind of kindness coming from pirates. Sanji tells him it is strictly out of responsibility and the second their body issues are taken care of, he is going to fight and beat the samurai to a pulp. The samurai then thanks Sanji. Sanji remarks that he is finally showing some gratitude and maybe everyone should get frozen once.\nThey then see a group in the distance. It is the Centaur Patrol Unit. They are running from the monster that appeared at the lake. Zoro asks what they are talking about. The centaurs then notice the pirates, angry that they lost, but keep moving. Zoro then looks toward the lake, and does not seem to remember the enormous mountain currently there.\nThe scene changes to inside the lab. Caesar Clown is talking about how Slime is the same thing that caused the massive explosion four years ago. Everyone thinks Caesar purified the toxic gas, but Caesar reveals that he simply condensed it and, not wanting to be wasteful, compressed it into Slime. He goes on to say that just because people forget a tragedy does not mean it is gone. In fact, it was sitting in the palm of Caesar's hand all this time.\nOutside the front of the lab, the G-5 Marines are stealing a ship. Tashigi tries to hold off some enemies, but accidentally transforms into smoke and cannot control it. Smoker tells her to get out of the way and asks if the door barring their escape is open. A soldier responds that the enemy is in the lab and the door will not move. This irritates Smoker, as it would all be easier if he were in his own body.\nBehind the lab, Law and Chopper warp into one of Law's Rooms. Law explains where they are and where Caesar and Monet are. He tells Chopper to investigate the drugs while he works on a way to get Caesar and Monet out of the building. Chopper asks why Law could not just capture them since they trust Law so much, making infiltration easy for him. Law tells Chopper he has a certain problem that prevents him from capturing them so easily. The Straw Hats need to capture Caesar as quickly as possible and Law will do the rest. Law then hears screaming. Tashigi looks up to see something flying toward them, thinking it to be a huge bomb. It turns out to be Luffy, Robin, and Franky. Luffy and Franky crash into the bow of the destroyed Marine ship. Robin avoids the impact by using Wing. Robin lands delicately while Franky punches his way out of the wrecked ship. Luffy then shouts for \"Master\" to get outside so they can beat him up and kidnap him. Franky comments on how good of a shortcut they took while Robin reminds them they are supposed to be secretive. Law is irritated by Luffy's conspicuous entrance, while Smoker and the rest of G-5 are surprised to see him."

In response, the Straw Hats and everyone else begin fighting off the Sea Laphans when Breed suddenly calls off the attack, revealing himself atop the Thousand Sunny.\nWith Breed having kidnapped Caesar, Luffy attacks him, but he is stopped by a Kung Fu Dugong using a Armament Haki-infused fist. Breed escapes with Caesar, while Law tries to use his abilities to stop him. When Law tries to use Room, he is interrupted by Sea Lapahns rocking the boat. When everyone turns around, they see a massive ship the size of an island, with Sanji noticing a Jolly Roger resembling Breed. Law, Luffy and Chopper decide to board the Shark Submerge III to go after Breed.\nAs they leave, Chopper askes Luffy if he recognizes the Sea Lapahns, noting they look identical to the Lapahns back on Drum Island. Law asks Chopper if that's why he joined them, proceeding to call him a tanuki. Chopper begins yelling at Law, but Law notices the Sea Lapahns entering Breed's ship. The pirates step out of the Shark Submerge III and into Breed's ship, with Law warning Luffy to be careful. Just then, Luffy decides to yell to Law that it's not as dark where he is. Law, Luffy and Chopper head towards the middle of the ship, but they are suddenly attacked by Sea Laphans, an Octopus Boxer, and other sea creatures.\nThey successfully fight off the sea creatures when the Kung Fu Dugong from earlier arrives and attempts to attack Luffy. Luffy defeats the Dugong, when the Dugong remembers losing to Luffy in a fight while in the Arabasta Kingdom. Excited, he jumps towards Luffy and begins hugging him. Meanwhile, Caesar is seen locked in a cage with Seastone handcuffs. He asks if anyone can free him as Breed enters the room. Caesar recognizes him and asks if he can be set free to see Doflamingo. However, Breed just tells him to stop whining and calls him worthless scum, causing Caesar to realize that Breed is not working under Doflamingo. Breed explains his plan to make a kingdom full of pets and that he needs Caesar's help to do it. However, Caesar refuses to help Breed, and Breed uses his ability on the scientist.\nElsewhere, Luffy is catching up with his Kung Fu Dugong friend and training him. As leader of the Sea Animal Pirates, the Dugong apologizes to Luffy for attacking him and explains his journey since leaving Arabasta. He explains that after arriving in the New World, Breed enslaved his crew. Suddenly, Breed began speaking into the intercom, commanding them to fall in line. Panicked, the Dugong tells them to run away quickly.\nWhen Breed arrives and scolds the Dugong for not listening to him, he sees the Straw Hats and Law and explains that he is a pirate. He attacks Chopper with a green substance that, upon hitting him, transforms into a collar. Breed then commands Chopper to attack Luffy and Law, and Chopper eats a Rumble Ball, transforming into Monster Point. Powered up, he attacks his former allies, distracting them and allowing Breed to collar them as well."

Chopper, running scared, is actually being chased by the Divine Soldiers, but they encounter a Shandia and ignore Chopper and fight one another. Robin, still at the ruins, is approached by a Divine Soldier who tells her to go this route leading to God's shrine. Robin, upset at the Divine Soldier for breaking some part of the ruins, defeats him.\nZoro, still making his way through the forest, is attacked by a Shandia warrior and Zoro punches him, knocking him out. In that moment, Braham defeats a Divine Soldier and proceeds to fight Zoro. Zoro initially tried to ignore the fight since Braham was not a priest. However, when Braham's attacks continued, Zoro prepared to fight him saying that he is glad Braham is not a second-rate flunkie. The Shandia and the Divine Soldiers are now engaged in battle and so are Braham and Zoro. Zoro was initially having problems fighting Braham because of the Jet Skis and Flash Guns that Braham has, thus making it a long-range battle. As the battle continues, Zoro decides to try his new technique. With Ittoryu - Sanjuroku Pound Ho, Zoro was able to defeat Braham and commented to himself about accepting the survival game.\nChopper, wailing about being left by the others, finds himself at the ruins and congratulates himself on being smart. Meanwhile, Gedatsu was in the same area and Chopper did not notice him. Luffy and Wyper continue their face-off and Wyper was shooting cannons at Luffy which Luffy rebounded using his Gomu Gomu no Mi abilities. Enel has visited the Straw Hats' ship and Sanji attempted at attacking but was defeated by Enel's Goro Goro no Mi abilities. Enel stated he had come without the intention of fighting and referred to Sanji as a foolish man. Gan Fall asked what his purpose of visit was, but Enel just told him it's been a long time since they met, and said that that is a cold-hearted way of greeting him."

          "Bellamy laughs at Luffy's demand that he give back Mont Blanc Cricket's gold. After their last encounter in Mock Town, he doubts Luffy even knows how to throw a punch. Sarquiss still believes the bounty poster for Luffy with his new 100,000,000 bounty is a fake. He questions if the old one for 30,000,000 is also real as he watches Luffy's fight with Bellamy. Bellamy breaks off the roof they are on and springs at Luffy with Spring Snipe, but Luffy jumps out of the way. The Bellamy Pirates sit back to \"watch the show\". Bellamy manages to hit Luffy when he's falling from the rooftops, and smashes him into the boardwalks. Luffy gets up as if nothing has happened, but Bellamy is still unimpressed with his effort.\nWanting to finish it, Bellamy begins springing off all the nearby buildings around Luffy with his Spring Hopper technique, all the while mocking Luffy for being among the pirates who chased dreams. Angered, Luffy cracks his knuckles, recalling Bellamy asking if he even knew how to throw a punch. As Bellamy springs toward him to finish him off, Luffy punches downward, striking Bellamy down through the boardwalks so hard he leaves an imprint of his fist in the now-unconscious pirate's head. Sarquiss urges Bellamy to get up, thinking Bellamy was fooling around. But it turns out the drunkard that found Luffy's new wanted poster was right about Luffy's notoriety. With Bellamy's blood dripping from his fist, Luffy demands Cricket's gold back, and the town's people scatters in a panic after learning Luffy and Zoro's bounties are real.\nBack at Cricket's camp, all of his associates are back to work retrofitting the Going Merry thanks to Chopper's care. Nami berates Zoro for not going with Luffy to challenge Bellamy, even though he was beaten up earlier too. He does not take kindly to her insults, and Usopp tries to cool them down as they start beating on the ship in their argument. Back in Mock Town, Luffy sacks up Cricket's gold. With Bellamy still laying in the broken boardwalk, Sarquiss tries to challenge Luffy, but is held back by the others. When asked where he is going, Luffy raises his fist, still covered in Bellamy's blood causing Sarquiss to fall to the ground in fear. Luffy then points upward and tells them, \"The sky!\"\nDrifting in the ocean, Dracule Mihawk gets Luffy and Zoro's new posters. He is pleased to see that they can now shake the World Government with their defeat of Crocodile.\nMeanwhile, at Mary Geoise, the Five Elders\u2014the de facto rulers of the world\u2014find out from a Marine that \"Red Hair\" is trying to get in contact with \"Whitebeard\" via messenger. They determine that the two meeting is too dangerous, and they must find a successor for the defeated Crocodile among the Seven Warlords of the Sea quickly to maintain balance between \"the powers\". They also admit that they cannot keep Luffy unchecked. Indeed, a meeting of the remaining Warlords of the Sea has been ordered. Two arrive: Donquixote Doflamingo and Bartholomew Kuma, both of whom had massive bounties before becoming privateers. When he arrives, Doflamingo toys with two of the present Marines, using his powers to make them fight each other out of sheer boredom. He is told to stand down by the Fleet Admiral of the Marines, Sengoku, who is impressed that even two of the remaining six Warlords of the Sea showed up. Doflamingo said he only came because his \"island business\" was running so well he was bored of it. Shortly after, they are joined by Mihawk, making it three Warlords. He says he was merely an onlooker in these proceedings, as he's interested in the pirates responsible for Crocodile's defeat.\nShortly after, a foreign voice joins in, and the room is invaded by a tall, lanky man with tap shoes. One of the Marines present identifies him as Laffitte, a former peace officer from West Blue who was chased from his country for his cruel methods. He says he is here to recommend someone to replace Crocodile.\nSomewhere on the seas, a captain receives a letter from Shanks. His men insult the messenger, Rockstar, a relative newcomer to the Red Hair Pirates who has a 94,000,000 bounty. The intended recipient of the message, Whitebeard, rips up Shanks' letter. The captain appears to be ill, as he has nurses all around and is connected to several IVs and an oxygen line. He tells Rockstar that if Shanks wants to send a message, he should deliver it personally, and bring good booze along with it. Rockstar alerts Shanks by Den Den Mushi. Shanks apologizes for putting Rockstar through all that, and tells his men to get ready to set sail to meet Whitebeard.\nAt Mary Geoise, Laffitte recommends his captain, Marshall D. Teach, to replace Crocodile as a Warlord. Sengoku does not even know who this pirate is, but Lafitte tells him that his crew, the Blackbeard Pirates, are hatching a plan to make their names known.\nIn Mock Town, while the citizens were talking about Bellamy's defeat, Teach looks at Luffy's reward poster, and comments on it. Then Sarquiss runs into him and tells him to get out, so Teach buries his head into the ground. Then, he declares that he does not intend to capture weaklings, but one man out of 100,000,000, so he and his companions begin to leave the city, while discussing Laffitte and fate.\nLuffy, however, is already on his way to the other side of Jaya with Cricket's gold."

Meanwhile, Masira and his crew appear to salvage the ship and think the Straw Hat Pirates are trying to steal their salvage. Nami thinks that it would be easier for them if Masira's salvage crew salvages the ship for them.

          "The Straw Hat Pirates notice some debris falling from the sky, initially thinking it was rain. Suddenly, an entire wrecked ship falls from the sky causing huge waves rocking the Going Merry after almost hitting it. When the seas have calmed down the Crew tries to figure out how a ship could fall from the sky. Nami then notices that her log pose is pointing towards the sky, thinking that it is broken. Robin suggests that the log pose isn't broken but is merely registering an island with strong magnetic pull further suggesting that it must be pointing towards Sky Island.\nThe Straw Hats are both in disbelief and excitement. Robin explains that Sky Island isn't exactly just an island in a sky, but rather, an entire ocean. Luffy tells them to set their course towards Sky Island but Sanji points out that they can't actually fly. Robin goes on to admit that her knowledge about the island is based solely on word of mouth and that she has never actually seen it. Nami thinks that the whole thing is made up and insists that their log pose is simply broken. Robin then argues that instead of trying to fix something that isn't broken, they should try to find a way to get to Sky Island. She further says that in the Grand Line, one must not doubt their log pose no matter how crazy things get, stating that this is the most steadfast, unbreakable rule in the Grand Line.\nRobin proceeds to study the skull of one of the sailors from the ship that just fell from the sky while Luffy and Usopp investigate the wreckage. After piecing together the skull, Robin sees that it has been punctured from an ancient medical procedure called craterization and deduces that the man must have been dead for at least 200 years. She further deduces that the ship must be St. Briss, an exploration ship from the South Blue.\nMeanwhile, as the ship is sinking, Luffy starts drowning. After being pulled up, he announces that he found a map of Skypiea within the wreckage. Nami inspects the map and remains skeptical since it could be a fake treasure map, further pointing out that even if it were real, the map doesn't show them how to get to the Sky Island. In order to get more information on how to get to Sky Island, Nami proposes that they salvage the ship that has now sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy volunteer to go, using special barrels attached to the Merry designed by Usopp which allows them to breathe underwater.\nWhile the trio is descending towards the shipwreck, a pirate ship arrives to where the ship has sunk. The captain of the ship introduces himself as Masira, Captain of the Masira Pirates and declares that the sunken ship is now the property of the King of All Salvagers. He orders his crew to raise the ship. Masira notices the presence of the Straw Hats and warns them about stealing \"his ship\" since, according to him, all ships that sink in the area are his property. The Straw Hats decide not to tell Masira that they have already sent a team to the shipwreck and also decide not to stop him from raising the ship. Nami uses her charms to avoid suspicion from Masira and he starts to try to impress her.\nAs Masira's crew is setting the cradle to raise the sunken ship, they ascend beaten up and unable to talk. However, Masira still does not suspect The Straw Hats. Underwater, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji have made it to the wreckage and start to explore, during which time, Masira is able to set the cradle and starts raising the ship. The St. Briss starts to fill up with air and ascends but the Masira Pirates start to encounter problems caused by Luffy's group. Masira decides to investigate this himself and swims under. He finds the trio inside and asks them what they were doing in his territory. Instead of answering, Luffy simply states that he (Masira) looks like a monkey, which Masira takes as a compliment thereby losing aggression towards the group. While they are exchanging pleasantries, a gigantic turtle suddenly eats the St. Briss and surfaces beside the Going Merry."

          "Zenny spots a fleet of Marine ships and realizes that a trap has been set up against the Straw Hats. Zenny decides to \u201csail down\u201d the mountain using his ship to help them. Zenny sees that he is now at sea and he declares that he has officially become a pirate.\nWhile the Marines are distracted, the Straw Hats head towards the Going Merry. A Marine sees this and asks Minchey to inform their captain that the pirates are up to something. Minchey shoots at him and reminds him they cannot tell their captain what\u2019s going on if they wanted to steal the old man\u2019s treasure.\nZenny realizes that the chief petty officer has been paying off his men so they can go on his side projects and mocks him. He challenges him that if he wanted his treasure, he would have to take it himself. Zenny then sends his goats to attack the Marine ship and chaos ensues.\nThe chaos proves to be too much for Zenny and he experiences chest pains. Minchey kicks him and grills him about the treasure\u2019s location. Zenny confesses that he is broke and that he has no treasure. Minchey doesn\u2019t believe him and decides to just search the whole island instead of waiting for the old man to tell him the treasure\u2019s location.\nBefore Minchey can kill Zenny, Robin throws an abacus at Minchey and the goats trample him. The Going Merry reaches Zenny and Chopper rushes to give him medical attention. With Minchey captured and everybody safe, Nami asks Zenny about his treasure. Zenny reveals that he exchanged all his treasure for cash. He was attacked by pirates and ended up marooned on the island. When he came to, the goats had eaten all his cash and left him with nothing which is why he considers the goats his treasure.\nThey then send Minchey flying back to the Marine fleet. Moore strips him of his rank and calls him a disgrace. He then calls Luffy and tells him that he has no interest in capturing Zenny. And that while he wants to capture the Straw Hats, he also wants to pay a debt of honor for delivering up a disgraced member of his fleet. He allows them to choose where they will fight. Luffy accepts and heads out to meet the Marine fleet. He then unintentionally leads the fleet to a foggy reef area which causes the Marine ships to sink.\nZenny goes back to the island to repair his ship and decides to sail off to sea after the repairs. The Straw Hats have set up Zenny\u2019s supplies and medicine so he will be able to head out when he is ready. Zenny decides that his age will not stop him from becoming a pirate and that he will go on adventures so long as he is able to.\nAs the crew worry about him, Luffy assures them that the old timer will be fine and Zoro agrees as he thinks while Zenny did have a weak heart, he had plenty of guts to make up for it."
