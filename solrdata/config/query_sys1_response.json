          "Big Mom rides to Udon where she and Tama express their love for red bean soup. Chopper fears that Big Mom will return to her normal self if she finds out that there was no red bean soup.\nHowever, Queen enjoys several bowls of the soup, revealing there was plenty of soup at Udon. Luffy continues to defeat the Pleasures with ease, so Queen decides to bring out the Gifters. Luffy is put against Batman, with advanced hearing, flight and a bow and arrow, and Gazelleman, with super speed. Despite this, Luffy defeats them relatively swiftly with Haki-imbued punches. Still, Luffy is disappointed that he could not defeat them without touching them like Rayleigh did.\nAt the bridge of Ringo, the sword thief, identified as Gyukimaru, battles against Zoro. He becomes angry when Zoro states that he met Ryuma. Gyukimaru explains Ryuma's significance. Several nobles in the past attempted to take over Wano Country but Ryuma was a formidable samurai who prevented them from doing so.\nTheir duel is interrupted by Komurasaki, who somehow survived Kyoshiro's attack, but is running away from an assassin, Hitokiri Kamazo, the slasher previously mentioned in the news. Kamazo intends to kill Toko for laughing and Komurasaki for disrespecting the shogun. Zoro helps Komurasaki in exchange for sake and food.\nZoro and Kamazo begin fighting, and the duel reaches a standstill as they seem equally matched. Zoro removes his outer garment, ready to fight harder."

          "After the devastating power of Kuma's Ursus Shock, everyone of the Straw Hat Pirates and the Rolling Pirates are knocked out. Kuma then takes this time to try and capture Luffy who is still worn out from his fight with Moria earlier. However, just as Kuma picks up Luffy, he is suddenly attacked by Zoro who slashes at him with Ittoryu Iai: Shishi Sonson. This attack manages to damage Kuma but Zoro is shocked to see cybernetic parts under Kuma. Zoro says he should've known that Kuma is a cyborg like Franky and Kuma fires a laser from his mouth that misses Zoro directly but the shockwave sends him flying.\nZoro is shocked to see that Kuma is able to fire a laser from his mouth and Kuma explains that he is a Pacifista. He continues on saying that a Pacifista is a creation designed to work for the World Government and says that he, himself, was created by the infamous Dr. Vegapunk. Zoro replies saying that Kuma has a major advantage being a Pacifista with Devil Fruit powers. Zoro also says that his body has given up on him but, not wanting to give up his captain's head, offers up his own life to Kuma. Zoro says his bounty may not be as high as Luffy's, but he is willing to give up his dream to become the world's greatest swordsmen in exchange. A surprised Kuma looks on how Zoro is willingly to give up his life and dream to make his captain's dream come true. Suddenly, Sanji gets up and offers up his life instead. However, Zoro, who already made up his mind, knocks Sanji out.\nZoro turns his attention back to Kuma who throws his swords in front of him and asks Kuma to show some honor. Kuma, after thinking for a while, agrees to Zoro's plea, saying that it wouldn't be honorable for him to still attack Luffy. Kuma, picking up Luffy, tells Zoro that he will spare Luffy but not before Zoro takes Luffy's place by experiencing all the pain he has endured during his time on Thriller Bark. Kuma then uses his powers to repel all the pain out of Luffy into a large, red mass of air. Kuma says that Zoro must take all of Luffy's pain if he really does want to take his place saying that the experience will kill Zoro as he is close to death. Kuma sends over a sample to Zoro and Zoro suffers intense pain from that small sample. Zoro falls to the ground but barely manages to make it back to his feet. Zoro then sticks his arms into the giant mass of pain. Kuma then remarks on Dragon having a good son.\nLater, the Straw Hats and the Rolling Pirates all regain consciousness. Franky is surprised to see Luffy acting well, who tells the crew that his body feels as good as new. As the other Straw Hats wonder why, Sanji runs off toward Zoro's direction. He reaches Zoro and asks what happened to the Warlord, but notices blood everywhere. Sanji asks Zoro what happened, and Zoro, who is covered head to toe in blood, says that nothing happened."

Zoro is seen talking to himself about his Flying Blade attack and he tried it out on a bird attempting to attack him, but he said the attack wasn't ready, thus searching for another thing to test this attack on. Chopper, running scared, is actually being chased by the Divine Soldiers, but they encounter a Shandia and ignore Chopper and fight one another. Robin, still at the ruins, is approached by a Divine Soldier who tells her to go this route leading to God's shrine. Robin, upset at the Divine Soldier for breaking some part of the ruins, defeats him.\nZoro, still making his way through the forest, is attacked by a Shandia warrior and Zoro punches him, knocking him out. In that moment, Braham defeats a Divine Soldier and proceeds to fight Zoro. Zoro initially tried to ignore the fight since Braham was not a priest. However, when Braham's attacks continued, Zoro prepared to fight him saying that he is glad Braham is not a second-rate flunkie. The Shandia and the Divine Soldiers are now engaged in battle and so are Braham and Zoro. Zoro was initially having problems fighting Braham because of the Jet Skis and Flash Guns that Braham has, thus making it a long-range battle. As the battle continues, Zoro decides to try his new technique. With Ittoryu - Sanjuroku Pound Ho, Zoro was able to defeat Braham and commented to himself about accepting the survival game.\nChopper, wailing about being left by the others, finds himself at the ruins and congratulates himself on being smart. Meanwhile, Gedatsu was in the same area and Chopper did not notice him. Luffy and Wyper continue their face-off and Wyper was shooting cannons at Luffy which Luffy rebounded using his Gomu Gomu no Mi abilities. Enel has visited the Straw Hats' ship and Sanji attempted at attacking but was defeated by Enel's Goro Goro no Mi abilities. Enel stated he had come without the intention of fighting and referred to Sanji as a foolish man. Gan Fall asked what his purpose of visit was, but Enel just told him it's been a long time since they met, and said that that is a cold-hearted way of greeting him."

Eric boards the Marine ship, and Lieutenant Commander Hardy commands the fleet to chase after the Going Merry.\nThe Straw Hat Pirates continue to sail towards Warship Island, only to be caught by Nelson Royale and his fleet.

Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill. The Silver Pirate Alliance members attack Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire as Bill prepares to kill them all with a bazooka. However, Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to knock out the pirates and their battle boats, leaving Bill alone and shocked. Luffy sees where Bill is, and Bill fires a cannonball at him, but Luffy shatters it as he punches Bill into the underground mine.\nBill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.\nBartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island. At the coast, the Silver Pirate Alliance and the Sweet Pirates get everyone onto a large ship as they prepare to escape the island's destruction. The Sweet Pirates worry about Desire, but are forced to set sail. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Barto Club are worried about Luffy and Bartolomeo, but Zoro is confident that they are all right since Luffy's vivre card is fine. Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.\nLater in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles. Inside Gran Tesoro, Tanaka arrives and reports to the Monster of the New World, a man named Gild Tesoro. Tanaka reports that Bill sank along with Silver Mine, but Tesoro is fine as he already had his fun with Bill and now was time for the real entertainment to start."

          "Zoro duels Ryuma in Hogback's lab, while Franky guards over the injured Brook. Neither Zoro, nor Ryuma, can gain any advantage over the other, as they keep matching the other's attack. Their attacks quickly destroy the lab, forcing them to escape the room and continue their fierce duel on the roof. As Brook watches on, he comes to the conclusion that Ryuma was never taking their fights seriously. After an intense sword fight, during which the entire roof collapses to the ground below, Zoro finally defeats Ryuma using a technique which sets him ablaze. Zoro lands hard on the lip of the roof below. Ryuma manages to land on a higher ledge. Ryuma staggers slightly, then acknowledges his defeat at Zoro's hands. Sheathing Shusui, Ryuma throws it to Zoro. Ryuma collapses in a gout of flames, and Brook's shadow is finally returned to him, to his great joy. Zoro acknowledges Ryuma's skill as a swordsman and says he wishes he could have met Ryuma before he died. He also agrees to forget the outcome of their fight. "

          "At Hogback's lab, 5 minutes earlier, Ryuma mocks how Zoro intends to take the Shusui sword from him. Zoro points out how he has carried three swords, one of which being a broken sword. The swordsman prepares to fight using two swords. Ryuma revels at the challenge Zoro is presenting and blocks a hard attack. Ryuma then uses Aubade Coup Droit, shooting bullets of air out of his sword. It would seem to be a draw, as the lab is about to cave-in. Brook knows that in Ryuma's former life, he was still a fearsome samurai.\nRyuma then thrusts his sword at Zoro with Prelude Au Fer to break his swords, with the latter retaliating with a Flash. It doesn't get through. He then uses a Demon Magma Bear, but the attack is also blocked. The zombie samurai then uses a Gavotte Bond en Avant, launching an intense thrust at his foe with Zoro using a Sword style Rashomon, dashing past each other. Ryuma takes the hit and the lab's structure begins to weaken.\nFranky hopes to take Brook to safety, while Zoro and Ryuma continue their fight using a 72-Caliber Phoenix and Polka Remise respectively on one another. Franky then fires a Weapons Left to make a safe exit. On the rooftop, the Straw Hat swordsman and the zombie samurai appear to be evenly matched even with limited movement. The two continue to swing their swords with Zoro about to lose his footing. Breathing heavily, Zoro worries that his swords will break if he keeps it up. Suddenly, a part of the roof is blasted. Zoro almost lands a Soaring Dragon and the skeleton uses an Arrow Notch Slash, wounding Zoro greatly. Just then, Ryuma is lit on fire.\nWith Zoro lying on the ground, Ryuma admits defeat. He passes Shusui onto his opponent as the sword has had a long history of owners. Zoro catches the sword and Ryuma believes he feels shame in his failure. Zoro wishes they could have met in the era when Ryuma was alive. Just then, Brook's shadow finally returns to its rightful owner, allowing Brook to walk around in broad daylight and he makes another skeletal joke. As Ryuma cremates, Zoro wants to pretend the fight never happened.\nUsopp runs down a hallway and hopes to inform his friends of his victory over Perona and dodges a group of Wild Zombies using an empty picture frame.\nElsewhere, a group of armored zombies are told by Hildon that the downed zombies were meant to restrain Oars. Just then, Oars arrives and the bat-like zombie orders a retreat. However, the zombie warriors try to charge at the giant zombie anyway, but Oars smashes through the generals. Remembering the orders, Oars continues his march.\nLuffy is now beginning to feel tired while Moria gloats how he can be Pirate King without lifting his fingers. The Doppelman then drops onto Luffy and then slams the Straw Hat captain around. Moria warns that his backup will be arriving any moment."

To distract them, Usopp uses a chalkboard and drags his nails down it to make a loud noise; he grabs Vivi and runs away.\nMeanwhile, Luffy finds where Crocodile, Nefertari Cobra, and the critically injured Nico Robin is. Crocodile is upset that Luffy is still alive, no matter how many times he defeats Luffy. Cobra is baffled by who the strange boy is (Luffy). Luffy demands that Crocodile give him back Vivi's country, so Vivi can smile again. Luffy punches Crocodile twice and Crocodile is confused about how he is doing it without water. Luffy was using his blood to touch Crocodile preventing Crocodile from using his powers from the devil fruit. Crocodile takes off a covering from his hook that reveals he has poison in it.\nZoro runs to where the smoke bomb was shot by Usopp. But finds a group of Marines who were with Tashigi. They berate him for having a poor sense of direction and then give him orders on where to go to find the center of the city of Alubarna.\nVivi and Usopp are still running with Baroque Works members chasing them. Tashigi and a few Marine members attack the men chasing Vivi and Usopp. Nami and Tony Tony Chopper find Vivi and Usopp with two minutes left before the bomb kills the Royal Army and Rebel Army and everyone in the center of Alubarna. Pell is shot from the sky by a mysterious frog woman hidden in the Clock Tower who is later revealed to be working for Baroque Works.\nLuffy and Crocodile continue their fight and Luffy dodges Crocodile's attacks made by his hook. Cobra notices that Crocodile is struggling in the fight.\nVivi is looking for Pell thinking he's their only hope to reach the cannon in time. Sanji and Zoro are in the Clock Tower.

Kawamatsu fights them off, and explains what happened after he lost Hiyori.\nThirteen years ago, after Hiyori ran away, he decided to leave to Ringo. Ringo was a region that was previously ruled by the daimyo Shimotsuki Ushimaru, who was with the company of a fox, Onimaru. However, when Orochi overthrew Oden, Ushimaru was killed and Ringo fell.\nKawamatsu found a mass burial site with Eternal Graves. These corpses were buried in caskets and did not decompose due to the cold. They were marked by the deceased person's sword, which was said to contain the soul of the deceased. These swords became attractive to grave robbers, but the graveyard was guarded by the fox, Onimaru.\nOnimaru was initially hostile to Kawamatsu but eventually warmed up to him. However, he became hostile again after he saw Kawamatsu taking the swords from the graves. Kawamatsu explained that the swords were to be used for the upcoming Onigashima raid. Given that the samurai in the swords will help their wielders in battle, Onimaru allowed him, helping him gather the other swords.\nTogether they would build a hideout to keep the swords, steal food from the capital to keep themselves fed, and fight off any grave robbers, taking their swords. Unfortunately, when Kawamatsu attempted to steal tofu one day, he fell into a trap and was arrested, being sent to the Udon prisoner mine.\nBack in present day, Kawamatsu goes to the place where Gyukimaru disappeared, and finds that it is the location where the swords were located. He contacts Kin'emon and tells him that he has the supply of swords needed for the army. It is revealed that Gyukimaru was the one who arranged the swords while Kawamatsu was gone, as he was actually Onimaru in his human form. He transforms back into his fox form and leaves, his duty fulfilled.\nZoro tries to take back Shusui, but Hiyori asks him to leave it. Hiyori offers him a replacement sword, the Enma. This sword belonged to Oden himself and is the only sword to have ever successfully injured Kaidou."

Meanwhile, Onigashima approaches Wano Country proper, finally reaching the mainland.\nAs the samurai begin to give up in their fight, the Nine Red Scabbards continue to fight, stating they won't stop until they defeat Kaidou. Izou points out how they can't confirm Luffy's death, and Kawamatsu remarks that even the possibility destroyed morale. However, Sanji refuses to even consider that Luffy lost, getting angry at the samurai for thinking that they might have lost.\nBack on the Live Floor, Queen has gotten the upper hand against Chopper, and Perospero continues to bombard the samurai with arrows. They encourage everybody to give up fighting, and Queen is about to bite Chopper; however, he's stopped by Sanji. Sanji's kick is hard enough to send Queen's head spinning, causing him to intercept all of Perospero's arrows as well as send Perospero himself flying. He congratulates Chopper for holding off Queen enough for him to arrive, and tells him to continue trusting in Luffy, before handing him Zoro and telling to take care of the injured swordsman. Sanji resolves to fight Queen, and the samurai look on in awe, noting how he doesn't give up despite his captain having been defeated.\nMeanwhile, above the first floor, Kaidou easily defeats Kin'emon. Despite his injuries, Kin'emon continues to stand up and stab Kaidou, allowing Shinobu and Momonosuke time to run. As he struggles, Kin'emon thinks back to when they were sent to the present day. He thinks back to when he and Momonosuke pretended to be father and son, and encourages him to continue living. However, he is stabbed again by Kaidou, collapsing to the floor.\nAs Shinobu and Momonosuke run, he also thinks back to his time with Kin'emon. He resolves himself to tell the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance members that Luffy isn't dead, and speaks into one of the Marys, announcing it across the island. He declares that Luffy is speaking to him, and encourages the allies to continue fighting until Luffy returns to the island."

Vivi explains that according to Crocodile, within ten minutes, a huge cannon will be fired, and once the cannon is fired, no one within a five-kilometer radius will survive, wiping out both the Rebel and Royal Army forces. Zoro tells them that they need to find the cannon and stop the cannoneer from shooting. Before they can go ahead and look for the cannon, some Baroque Works Billions find Vivi and try to bring her to Crocodile for a promotion. Sanji and Zoro volunteer to stay behind to deal with the agents while the others go ahead and split up to look for the cannon.\nCrocodile is still laughing at Luffy's statement, telling him that it will not be so easy to defeat him, since he is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy is unimpressed and says that if Crocodile is one of the Seven Warlords, then he is the eighth Warlord. Cobra cannot believe what he is hearing and is impressed by Luffy's confidence. He asks who Luffy is, and Miss All Sunday tells him that he is the one responsible for bringing Vivi back to Arabasta.\nEven though Luffy has figured out how to land a punch on Crocodile, the Warlord is still confident stating that even though Luffy can hit him, he can still absorb any fluid in Luffy's body. He proceeds to dehydrate Luffy's arm, which Luffy counters by drinking more water. The two continue their battle and Luffy reveals that he was planning to throw the barrel of water he was carrying to douse Crocodile in water. Crocodile predicts this move and counters it by conjuring a twister of sand, sending both Luffy and the barrel flying away. Luffy barely catches the barrel of water. Crocodile laughs at Luffy, telling him that this battle is no different from the first time they fought. Luffy proceeds to drink the whole barrel of water he was carrying and dubs himself as Water Luffy, showing a bloated stomach full of water, which shocks both Crocodile and Cobra and amuses Miss All Sunday.\nCobra attacks Luffy but Luffy squirts out water from his mouth and douses Crocodile with water, just as he planned, making the Warlord susceptible to Luffy's physical attacks. Luffy uses his Gomu Gomu no Bazooka technique and hits Crocodile directly to his stomach which sends him crashing. Crocodile is lying on the ground, not moving. Miss All Sunday removes the stakes impaling Cobra and demands that he show her the way to the Poneglyph. Cobra asks what she wants with it, but she subdues him and reiterates her demand.\nCrocodile gets up and calls Miss All Sunday by her real name, Nico Robin, telling her that she should get going now to the Poneglyphs. As Nico Robin and the King leave, Crocodile uses his Ground Secco technique which dehydrates all of their surroundings turning it to a desert wasteland. Luffy shoots water at Crocodile which he simply absorbs with his hand. He continues to suck the moisture out of ground, the effects of which are felt throughout the palace.\nWith eight minutes left until the explosion, Vivi, Pell and the rest of the Straw Hats scramble to find the cannon.\nMeanwhile, Cobra asks if Nico Robin is truly Miss All Sunday's name. He remembers that the name was known throughout the world twenty years ago. On their way to the Poneglyphs, they encounter Tashigi and a bunch of Marines. Tashigi refuses to let them pass, but Robin uses her abilities to incapacitate some of her men. Seeing the ability, a Marine recognizes who she is and tells Tashigi that twenty years ago, when she was eight years old, Robin earned a bounty of 79,000,000 for sinking six Marine ships, classifying her as a first-degree risk. After the incident, she was said to have vanished and never heard from again. After hearing about her reputation, Tashigi commands her men to go to the Palace Square to stop the explosion, deeming it useless for so many men to fight against someone with her power. She stays behind, deciding to fight her, but Robin uses her ability against Tashigi and easily defeats her.\nIn the palace, the entire lawn has turned to sand. Crocodile is able to sneak up on Luffy and grab him by the neck. Luffy spits water at Crocodile but misses and he proceeds to absorb all of the water in Luffy's body, dehydrating him. Luffy's signature straw hat is shown to be blown away by the wind. While still holding Luffy by the neck, Crocodile declares that Luffy has lost to him for the second time."

          "Ace starts fighting Smoker while the crew is running away to the Going Merry. As they flee, Nami asks Luffy if Ace is really his brother. Luffy confirms this and tells them his name. A bifurcation is in their way and Nami tells everyone to follow her, but Luffy goes the other way, as he was watching his brother fight. The Straw Hats arrive at the ship and carry all the supplies, only to notice that Luffy is missing. Luffy is sitting on the barrel he was carrying in an alley, but he does not know where his crew went. Ace greets him from the top of a house in the alley and then comes down. They start arm wrestling on top of the barrel Luffy was sitting on, but after struggling, the barrel breaks and the water inside it scatters. They both agree that they are equally strong. Ace invites Luffy and his crew to join the Whitebeard Pirates, but Luffy declines.\nOn Smoker's ship, Mr. 11 is left alone, tied to the mast. Some Billions get on the deck and Mr. 11 asks them to untie him. They explain that as Billions, they are candidates to be promoted to Officer Agents. Mr. 11 asks them to untie him again, but they shoot him. The Billions get off the ship and someone informs them that Fire Fist Ace is in the town. One of them then comments that if they take down Ace, they will surely be promoted to Officer Agents.\nLuffy and Ace start searching for Luffy's crew, but as they walk, Billions start to surround them without being noticed. After they are gathered, everyone comes out. Luffy and Ace do not care what they say and keep walking but the Billions start a fight. After Luffy sends the leader flying with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, one of the Billions tells his comrades not to be scared by that, and everyone keeps chasing them again. Luffy spots his ship and stretches his arms in order to reach for it. He enters the ship ramming towards Sanji and Chopper. Ace reaches the ship in his boat, but then they spot five Billions ships coming towards them. Ace tells Luffy that he can handle them, gets in his boat, and starts propelling it with the help of his flames. He then jumps over a ship and when he lands, he launches a Hiken, destroying the five ships consecutively.\nSmoker is talking to Tashigi and asks what Nefertari Vivi was doing with the Straw Hats. Tashigi proposes that perhaps she was a hostage to a major scheme, but Smoker does not think so. He thinks that is unlikely since she was getting along with the group as if she was one of them. He says that something big is going to occur and that he may know where they are heading after Luffy told him he only wanted to beat Crocodile. Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper in the Going Merry are toasting for Ace joining the Straw Hats, but Ace tells them he is not joining them. After that, he explains that he is in search for Blackbeard after he killed one of his crewmates. He also explains that he is heading to Yuba, and Nami tells him that they are going to the same place. Vivi proceeds to explain the route and after that, they toast for having a fun time together."

Nami is angry that Luffy and Zoro are not fighting back since they could easily defeat those guys. After much beating, Bellamy ordered someone get Luffy and Zoro from his sight stating they are eyesores. They were kicked out of the bar. Sarquiss offered to buy Nami stating that she would not survive the new era with those guys. Nami responded saying she is too good to join a team of pansies like Bellamy's crew. They responded laughing and saying the crew is full of weaklings. Nami grabbed Luffy and was walking down the street when someone yelled out saying Sky Island exists. Nami recognized Blackbeard and he told her that Luffy and Zoro won the fight and her tongue lashing was impressive as well. He said the new era Bellamy talks about is rubbish. He went on saying that people's dreams never end and if Luffy seeks the Summit, he would find fights that fists alone would not take him to. Blackbeard left saying he hopes Luffy finds Sky Island.\nReturning to the ship, the rest of the Straw Hat crew inquired as to why Luffy and Zoro look so beat up. Nami still very angry at what occurred at the bar asked why they could not fight back. Zoro stated that she had mentioned something earlier about that and Nami, still angry, said it was in the past. Chopper asked if they found anything related to the Sky Island and Nami stated she does not care about that anymore and just mentioning about Sky Island made the whole bar mock her. Robin returned and gave Luffy a map stating that a man was outcast for talking about his dreams.\nOn their way to find the man, they came across Shoujou. Luffy voiced that Shoujou looked weird and the Shoujou pirates took offense to that however, Shoujou brushed it off. Shoujou went ahead and told Luffy that a Warlord named Crocodile has been kicked off and he (Shoujou) is awaiting his invitation to join the Warlords of the Sea. Luffy told Shoujou to move aside because they had a place to go. Shoujou became upset and said that this area was his territory and if they want to pass by, they have to pay the toll fee. On hearing that, Usopp recognized that Masira had said the same thing. Shoujou heard Masira's name and asked what about Masira. Luffy responded saying they sort off kicked him but he is probably alive. Shoujou got very angry and began to use his Havoc Sonar. However, doing this, Shoujou was destroying his ship as well as the Straw Hats'. The Straw Hats fled from the reach of his voice.\nMeanwhile, back at the bar, a customer was talking about how a beautiful and strong woman was inquiring about Mont Blanc Cricket. Another responded saying that sea territory belonged to the Saruyama brother but Cricket is known to have acquired a new gold treasure. On hearing this, Bellamy asked where the man was located and would like to meet him. He demanded to be told more."

          "Luffy wants to depart right away to Enies Lobby even though the Aqua Laguna is hitting the island. He asks Paulie if there's a ship he could borrow to get them there, or better yet, a sea train. Paulie informs them that the sea train was built by a team headed by a legendary shipwright and there's nothing else like it in existence in the world and if they were to set out, they would immediately get killed so they would do better to wait until morning.\nAt that moment Nami remembers reading about Enies Lobby and the Gates of Justice - a set of large steel gates beyond which people only find despair. Enies Lobby is known as the Judicial Island and has a judicial court located on it. However, it functions as such in name only; if you're taken to Enies Lobby, you're already considered guilty. Beyond the Gates of Justice lie two locations, one is the Marine Headquarters and the other is Impel Down - an undersea prison reserved for the criminals who once ran amok in the world. Robin, who has a bounty on her head, would only suffer pain once she crossed those doors.\nPaulie tells them that they shouldn't go there because they are pirates too and would get caught. Luffy declares he is going and he would steal a ship to get there. Paulie and Luffy are about to fight, when Kokoro stops them and asks Luffy to follow her if they didn't fear death.\nSanji gets to the railcar where Franky and Usopp are tied up and after defeating all the officers inside, Sanji and Franky get into an argument that Usopp unsuccessfully tries to stop. There are several Den Den Mushi there which Sanji plans to use to call Nami. But the argument is loud enough that Captain T Bone who is in the next car is alerted and draws his sword to check the commotion.\nKokoro leads Luffy, Zoro and Chopper to the unused sea train, Rocketman. It is a sea train which wasn't used because its speed couldn't be controlled. Iceburg is already at the train and has serviced it and filled it with coal enough to last the trip. After he is thanked by Luffy, Iceburg tells him that he can thank him later if he isn't killed by the train ride.\nNami comes there bringing with her the two conductors who are carting in meat and drinks, and both Zoro and Luffy dig in and thank her. While he is eating, the Franky Family members come in and beg Luffy to be let to ride with them to go and rescue Franky. While Nami opposes, Luffy just tells them to get in; however, they would ride on king bulls and need only hold on to the train as it went.\nThe gang get on and the train is ready to depart with Kokoro piloting the Rocketman as she tells Iceburg to rest up, and that Franky would be okay, as he got hit by a Sea Train and survived. Paulie also sneaks onboard the train as it is leaving while Luffy gets on top of the train and holds on. He yells that they are going to get everything back as the train departs."

          "The Straw Hat Pirates, Franky, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe leap into the sea to find the Going Merry waiting for them. It takes a moment for the Marines of the Buster Call to realize what's happening. As the rope ladder seemingly drops on its own, Sanji and Nami climb aboard. As Zoro carries Chimney and Gonbe up with him, Franky brings Usopp, and Kokoro tosses Luffy, Robin, and Chopper aboard before climbing on, Sanji starts wondering how the Merry got here and who threw down the rope ladder. Many of the Straw Hats are choking back emotion at being back aboard their ship. Even Franky is wondering just how she got here after being dumped from his hideout by CP9. Luffy tries to thank Robin for getting him out of the tower, but a Fleur covers his mouth. Instead it is Robin who thanks everyone for saving her even when she felt she wasn't worth saving. In the emotional exchange, Chopper regains his ability to move. The Straw Hats soon organize and make plans to escape Enies Lobby.\nSpandam is livid and orders all guns on the Merry, even if it means killing Robin. Spandam justifies it (falsely) as orders from Aokiji that Robin is to be killed if she cannot be captured. But when the cannons fire, the shot miss the Merry and hit each other instead. Then, two of the ships crash into each other. Eventually, the Marines discover the reason for their loss of control: the Gates of Justice are closing, meaning the whirlpool currents are returning. Usopp then realizes this was the reason for Sanji's absence earlier. He had been in the third tower looking for the gates' operating lever. Thanks to his thinking ahead, they now have a fighting chance.\nAs the Merry speeds along, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, and Franky fend off cannonballs from the battleships. Eventually, Luffy crawls his way to the stern using his mouth and insists he join in the fight. Eventually, Zoro and Sanji decide to quiet him by stretching his body like a net and using him to catch and return a large salvo of the cannonballs. Eventually, Nami computes a course along the whirlpool currents, allowing them to outrace the cannonballs. Spandam goes into a tirade over how the mightiest force in the world can't defeat one pirate crew and capture one woman. The tirade eventually stops when the \"hands\" of Nico Robin envelop him and begin to bend him backwards. After all the physical and mental abuse he had inflicted upon her, everyone knew what was coming. With a final, cathartic, \"Clutch!\", Spandam's spine snaps in two and Robin gets her revenge. Nami then directs Franky to finish their escape. With apologies to the crew and ship, Franky fires his Coup de Vent, launching the Merry clear of the whirlpools, the Buster Call, and Enies Lobby altogether. A final Smoke Star from Usopp ensures they cannot pursue.\nMeanwhile, back at the Enies Lobby Front Gate, Zambai, Paulie, and the rest of the invasion force have boarded Puffing Tom and are starting their way back to Water 7. Lulu and Tilestone reflect on what's just happened while Mozu and Kiwi appreciatively cuddle up to Paulie in spite of his protests: resulting in a massive nosebleed from him. Everyone is in high spirits as in spite of bumps, bruises, and broken bones, they have taken on the World Government and made it out alive.\nEventually, Admiral Aokiji makes his way to Enies Lobby personally. The Buster Call is adamant in pursuing the Straw Hats, but Aokiji firmly orders everyone to stand down. There is no way to salvage the day now. The Buster Call is supposed to comprise a force equivalent to that of an entire country, yet their current situation is anything but proud and strong. Two ships are sunk, several more are severely damaged. And Enies Lobby stands a smoldering ruin: one of the great strongholds of the entire World Government destroyed. Something this catastrophic cannot be disguised or sugar-coated. The World Government has suffered a complete and utter defeat this day.\nAt his insistence, Kokoro positions Luffy at his customary position atop the Merry's figurehead. Luffy thanks Merry for coming to their rescue. He also thanks Franky for helping out. Franky has to appreciate the sheer audacity of the Straw Hats and cautions the World Government will be coming after them with a fervor now, but the Straw Hats don't care. To them, saving their friend was more important than defying the World Government and in this most important regard, they have won."

After falling, Karoo tells Vivi to run by signaling with his wing because Mr. 2 is getting closer. Out of nowhere two other members of the Duck Troops show up and Sanji is with them. Sanji is left to fight Mr. 2 and the two members of the Duck Troops take care of the injured Karoo.\nZoro and Nami are left with Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger. Nami and the ducks cheer Zoro on because they believe he is going to fight the Baroque Works members. But they walk past Zoro and go straight for Nami as they believe that the weakest opponent should be taken out first. Nami tries to talk her way out of it but realizes that they will not back down so she runs away.\nUsopp finds Chopper laying on the ground and wakes him up. Chopper tells Usopp that Miss. Merry Christmas ate the Mole Mole Fruit so she is able to go underground and that Mr. 4 is very strong. Usopp and Chopper are left to dodge the bombs that Mr. 4 continues to hit towards them."

          "In a flashback, the Shandia Chief is shown talking to a young Wyper and other young warriors telling them about the words inscribed on the Poneglyph and how the Shandia fought hard to protect the Poneglyph. Wyper was able to use the Seastone and Reject to attack Enel, which stopped Enel's heart. However, moments later, Enel was able to use his ability to reset the electrical waves in his heart thereby reviving himself. Enel indicated he warned Wyper initially, calling him Warrior Wyper several times which only angered Wyper who told Enel not to call his name without a reason. He told Enel that after 400 years of fighting to get to their homeland of Shandia, they are finally here and Enel is in the way. Enel commended Wyper for putting on a good fight but told him, he chose his opponent \"poorly.\" With that, Enel struck one of his drums with his staff, and got an electrical discharge of 30,000,000, which appeared in the form of a bird and attacked Wyper with Uroquois, which defeated Wyper. Zoro used the opportunity to pick up the Seastone, however, Enel attacks and also defeats Zoro using Kiten.\nEnel walked towards Nami who was the only unhurt person around and realized Wyper has got back on his feet. He questioned why Wyper still wants to fight after he's been sorely defeated. Wyper responded that he fights for his ancestors. Noting that he was hoping for a better answer, Enel struck Wyper using El Thor. With Nami left, she told Enel she would like to go with him to the Land of Dreams. Nami, taking her waver along, went along with Enel and had in mind to escape once the opportunity arises. Reaching their location, Nami was amazed by what she saw and Enel told her the flying ship is the first of its kind in the world. He told her he had used the gold from the City of Gold to build the Ark - Maxim. With the ark, he told her they would travel to a place with boundless land - Fairy Vearth.\nLuffy, Aisa and Pierre finally made it out of the snake's stomach only for Luffy to run up the ruins and yell at the top of his voice that he made it out. Aisa upon seeing their current location, came to a conclusion that where they are at could be their homeland, Shandora. Looking around, Luffy spotted his crew and ran towards them only to realize that they have been defeated, including Zoro. Luffy questioned who must have done such a deed after seeing that even Wyper, who is strong, is defeated. Aisa mentioned that it was only Enel who could do something like that. Since her Mantra was ineffective while stranded in the belly of the snake, she was unable to tell what was occurring on the outside. Just then, Robin regained consciousness and told Luffy of Enel's intention in destroying all of Skypiea. Luffy inquired about the Golden Belfry and Robin told him the possibility of Enel getting to it. Aisa then told Luffy she knows their location as she is able to \"hear\" two voices on the island of their location. Luffy then told Aisa to take him to the location of the voices."

Luffy asks Shirahoshi why she got out of Megalo's mouth, she apologizes and asks him not to get mad at her as she starts to cry. As someone calls Luffy filthy and heartless, Chopper urges Sanji not to turn around. Sanji realizes that Chopper's warning can only mean that the Mermaid Princess is right behind him. Chopper tells him he is correct, but seeing the princess would without a doubt kill him if a normal mermaid made him lose so much blood before.\nAs Sanji begins to get lost in thought, he remembers hearing that even the most beautiful woman in the world, the pirate empress, would pale in comparison, and realizes that his dream is now in his grasp. He then tells Chopper that for the sake of his dreams, he chooses death \u2013 Chopper retorts by exclaiming that he thought that his dream was to find the All Blue. He turns around and looks at her. He realizes that he is gazing upon something that his imagination could never fathom, that no painting could ever capture. He then turns to stone, much to Chopper's shock.\nLuffy is examining Hatchan, trying to get Hachi to tell him who attacked him. Chopper wonders if Sanji turning to stone could be from a side effect of receiving okama blood. Shirahoshi cries and asks Luffy what she should do, but all of a sudden, the locals take action and tie up Luffy, Chopper, Hatchan, and the still petrified Sanji. Luffy asks them what they are doing, and the locals tell him not to underestimate the warriors of Fish-Man Island. One of the locals identifies Hatchan as a former member of Arlong's gang. Shirahoshi tries to explain to everyone that Luffy was only helping her, but the locals will not listen and promise to behead the pirates. Luffy then notices something and tells them that something is flying toward them from behind the crowd, but a local asks Luffy if he really thinks they are dumb enough to fall for that.\nSomeone then notices that Luffy is not lying, and everyone is shocked to see it is none other than Vander Decken IX. Decken yells that he found her, this time saying \"Of course I did\" instead of \"I think\". The locals are shocked that after hiding out for ten years, he now suddenly appeared on the island, and someone yells for Shirahoshi to run for it. Decken tells Shirahoshi to give him an answer, saying she will escape death if she says yes, telling her to run away with him and marry him. The locals are shocked to hear him ask for marriage after constantly attempting to take her life. Shirahoshi tells him she is sorry, but he is not her type.\nThe locals are comically stunned to find out that is why she will not marry him, and not his violent tendencies. Decken is crushed, and actually looks emotionally hurt. He tells her she should be ashamed of herself, because he has had feelings for her for the past ten years and then she steps all over them. He then asks her who she is planning to be with. He goes on to say that now that he knows her feelings toward him, her existence is now an eyesore. He gets ready to attack her as a local tells her to run, but Luffy tells her to wait, having now dubbed her 'scaredy cat'.\nA local grabs him by the collar, and asks him if he is working for Decken, and if he wants the princess to die. Luffy shouts that if she gets too far away from him, then he cannot protect her, so Shirahoshi tells Luffy she will remain with him. Decken then attacks Shirahoshi with another axe with a rose painted on it. Luffy tries to help, but is blocked by locals who still think he is trying to harm the princess. Luffy apologizes, saying he has nothing against them, then knocks them out with a burst of Haoshoku Haki because they are in his way. He then kicks off from the ground, flying toward Decken who is still on the coral. He does a flip in the air and brings his legs down on the coral, sending it crashing to the ground and knocking Decken off. The locals are amazed at Luffy's abilities, even when he is tied up.\nDecken asks Luffy why he is interfering with his and Shirahoshi's love, and figures that Luffy was the one who brought Shirahoshi out of the palace. And Luffy realizes that Decken was the one who had been throwing things at Shirahoshi as he gets ready to do an attack. Decken tells him he will take both of their lives, saying they would not be a pair, as they would be cut into a set of four. Luffy then uses a new technique, Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer, plowing Vander Decken IX into the ground head first. The locals are shocked to see that Luffy beat Vander Decken.\nThey then realize that Decken was still moving, despite being planted head first into the ground, and decide to capture him. Luffy headbutts Megalo, telling him to wake up and asks Sanji if he is alright. Chopper tells Luffy that Sanji had turned to stone earlier, but now he seems happy, and most importantly, conscious. Luffy tells Shirahoshi they need to go. Shirahoshi asks Luffy not to yell at her, as all the excitement has gotten her quite worked up. Luffy tells her that for some reason the island hates them, and they need to get out of here.\nShirahoshi unties Luffy, making the locals wonder why she is helping him. She apologizes to them, and tells them she will be home in time for dinner, which confuses them. The Straw Hats get on Megalo's back, and Shirahoshi grabs on to his jaws (much to his discomfort), as they get away. Just as they get away, Vander Decken IX gets his head out of the ground and swats away the people trying to capture him. Yelling that they will not get away, he calls on Wadatsumi and tells him to pound them into the ground. Wadatsumi gets ready to punch them, but Luffy beats him to it, and hits him in the face with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol, breaking one of his teeth. Decken seems upset that they got away.\nThe scene changes to the Ryugu Palace, where someone informs Jones that Nami and Camie had escaped. Jones tells him to ignore it. Nami and Camie are then seen escaping, with the former holding onto the latter's back with an air bubble around her head. Camie asks if it was ok for them to leave the others behind but Nami tells her to relax, as nothing good could come by worrying. Camie tells her she knows that they are all strong, but that Hatchan told her that Jones's mind is more dangerous than his strength. Nami then asks her what kind of person Jinbe is. Camie replies that he is a pirate who is popular at the Ryugu Palace and can come and go as he pleases. Nami remembers that he was also in the same crew as Arlong, and that Jones is the successor to Arlong's will.\nShe then mentions one of Jinbe's messages to Luffy, \"Don't fight Hody\". Nami adds that she thinks she has figured out what the message means. Camie tells her she thought it only meant that Jones is dangerous. Nami adds that it is okay for Zoro and the others to get Jones angry. She then tells Camie she wants to meet Jinbe, and remembers he is waiting at the Sea Forest. Nami says that the situation seems to have a long and deep-rooted history, and has a feeling that Jinbe knows all about it. She then asks Camie to head to the sea forest.\nBack in the palace, Neptune is giving orders to his guards. The soldiers tell him they will take care of Jones and the pirates. Neptune tells them not to. He tells them that even though he did not get a chance to fight, they all ended up as victims. He orders them to surrender the castle for now, reunite with Fukaboshi, and get ready for the rematch.\nThe guards are shocked at the orders. Usopp and Brook are in the water. Usopp wonders what Zoro can do to fight a fish-man in the water as Brook tells Usopp he is not going to make it. The episode ends with Zoro seemingly defeating Jones with a single slash, and the New Fish-Man Pirates astounded at what happened to their captain, with Usopp looking on in shock."

He then thanks Luffy for saving him and says that he will cook the food.\nShuzo arrives at the location and notes they are out of torpedoes. Several of his men offer their lives to be used as kamikaze torpedoes, prompting Shuzo to acknowledge their sacrifice and say that they are true men. He then states that he will not let their deaths be for nothing. The ships then prepare to attack the Straw Hats."

          "After, escaping death by luck, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji head for the Going Merry, but Buggy and Alvida are in pursuit. Before the duo can take off they are captured by the Marines, but the duo later escape. On the way Tashigi appears and challenges Zoro to a duel for lying to her, Zoro points out that he didn't lie, he just didn't tell her. Nevertheless, Zoro and Tashigi clash swords.\nMeanwhile, Nami and Usopp reach the Going Merry as Mohji was about to burn it down. Before Mohji can properly fight Nami, the Marines catch up and shoot at Mohji. Nami and Usopp take this opportunity board the Going Merry and set sail.\nAt the same time, Luffy and Sanji run into Smoker, who plans to catch Luffy. Sanji goes on, while Luffy and Smoker engage in battle. Luffy's efforts to defeat Smoker are knocked back however and Smoker seemingly defeats him, but a mysterious figure stops Smoker and releases a strong gust of wind, thus giving Luffy time to escape. As Zoro also flees, Sanji reaches the shore, but is surrounded by the marines. After this, Usopp uncharacteristically risks his life by diving into the sea, shooting down the marines with his slingshot, and finally swimming to Sanji. Luffy and Zoro catch up. Luffy then uses his Gomu Gomu Rocket to propel Sanji, Usopp, and Zoro to the Going Merry.\nSmoker, Tashigi, Buggy and Alvida decide to chase them to the Grand Line as they gather up in different teams. The Straw Hat crew is ecstatic to go to the Grand Line as they all make their vows before setting sail."
