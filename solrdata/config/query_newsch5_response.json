        "title": "An Unexpected Return! Luffy, to Marineford!",
        "air_date": "August 21, 2011",
        "short_summary": "The Marine Headquarters have started rebuilding, and the Marines had a meeting about Monkey D. Luffy. A Marine ship returned, but does not stop at the bay; instead, it shot at the island and began to circle it. The Marines began firing back, and discovered the ship to be carrying Jinbe, Luffy, and Rayleigh. After completing one circle around Marineford, the three disembark onto the island, with Jinbe and Rayleigh distracting the Marines while Luffy runs to the Ox Bell. While news reporters and other bystanders watch him, Luffy rings the bell sixteen times. He then dropped a bouquet of flowers into the largest crack in the ground, put his straw hat to his chest, and closed his eyes. The reporters excitedly photographed the incident, before Luffy, Rayleigh, and Jinbe leave the island.\nIn a meeting between Fleet Admiral Sengoku and Commander-in-Chief Kong at an unknown location, Sengoku tells his superior that he wants to retire from the Marines, and nominates Aokiji as his replacement. Koby wakes up in hospital, and learns that he now possesses the skill of Haki. Captain Smoker decided to go to the New World to go after Luffy, and asks Aokiji for a transfer to G-5. In the New World, Hawkins is seen being challenged by the pirate Brownbeard, and Eustass Kid is shown killing another pirate crew for displaying weakness and wishing to return to Paradise.",
        "long_summary": "The episode started with a view of Marineford being rebuilt. It showed a room full of vice-admirals as Lieutenant Commander Brannew talked about how Luffy is revealed to have survived the Summit War of Marineford and caused trouble again. A flashback followed, showing what happened two days ago. Two reporters are seen talking about how the Marines will go after the pirates involved in the war. Suddenly, some Marines see the warship which Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh are on. They made a full circle around Marineford before entering the bay (which is done in a funeral). After that, all three of them got to the plaza. Luffy then ran toward the Ox Bell and rang it sixteen times. Afterwards, he went to the largest crack from the battle in the ground and dropped a bouquet of flower in it and held his hat to his chest in a manner of paying respect. Reporters who were at the scene excitedly took photographs of the incident. Soon afterwards, a huge whale-shark appeared in the bay as Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh escaped from Marineford. After that, the newspapers printed the story and delivered it to all around the world, including Water 7, Sabaody Archipelago, Arabasta, and Foosha Village. The flashback ends as Brannew stated that it is humiliating for them to have let Luffy go.\nAfter that there was a scene showing the Five Elders discussing who should fill the vacancies in the Shichibukai positions and that Blackbeard was turning out to be a lot of trouble. They also comment on how those with the \"D\" are beginning to stir up trouble at the same time.\nThe next scene showed World Government Commander-in-Chief Kong and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku discussing Sengoku's retirement. Sengoku also recommended Admiral Aokiji to be the next Fleet Admiral.\nThe scene changed to Koby, Helmeppo, and a doctor in the hospital, discussing how Koby has obtained Observation Haki. Koby, talking within himself states that he feels different with this new power and he has to train more to become stronger; as strong as \"him\" (\"him\" referring to Luffy).\nAfter that, Admiral Aokiji and Smoker talked about what Luffy did at Marineford and about Smoker's transfer to the Marine base G-5.\nIn the New World, Eustass Kid and his crew were talking about Luffy's actions. Kid asked what the Ox Bell is. Killer explained what it is and the reason he thinks why Luffy rang it sixteen times.\nThe scene changes to Capone Bege's ship, which was being pulled up to a huge black ball in the sky, and Urouge's ship, which was approaching an island that was constantly being hit by lightning. An old woman offered to sell the crew some umbrellas. It then goes back to Kid as he declared that he will defeat Luffy in the New World.",

        "long_summary": "Kuro attempts to use Shakushi on Luffy once again, but this time Luffy uses his rubber body to restrain him and prevent him from moving. Stretching his neck back, he uses Gomu Gomu no Kane, a powerful headbutt knocking Kuro unconscious and destroying his glasses. Concluding the battle, Luffy orders the remaining Black Cat Pirates to leave the island, taking Kuro with them.\nSimultaneously, Zoro and Usopp arrive to protect Kaya from Jango. Zoro cuts down a tree branch, clearing the way for Usopp's Hissatsu: Kayaku Boshi, a fired pellet that explodes in Jango's face, defeating him. As he did not want to be known as the village hero, Usopp asks the children not to disclose his deeds to the townspeople.\nAfter meeting with the crew to thank them for their help, Usopp meets with the children. Explaining his desires to leave the village to become a real pirate, Usopp disbands the crew, telling each child to pursue their individual ambitions.\nTo thank them for their heroic deeds, Kaya gifts the crew with the Going Merry, a full-sized caravel designed by Merry. Gratefully accepting the ship, the crew prepare to depart, also deciding to take Usopp along as a new permanent member of the crew.\nKaya meets with Merry at the coast, where Merry explains Usopp's past. In his childhood Usopp's father, Yasopp, set sail with Shanks to become a pirate, leaving behind his son and wife. Usopp's mother passed away from illness soon after Yasopp's departure. Now lonely, Usopp became the town liar, hoping that his lies would come true and his father would someday return.\nIn the present day, the children assume Usopp's role as the town liar, claiming an incoming pirate invasion.",

Meanwhile, Enel appears on the Going Merry and after telling them that his true goal was the City of Gold, he takes out both Usopp and Sanji; he then vanishes and leaves Satori's brothers, Hotori and Kotori, to avenge him.",
        "long_summary": "Usopp cries over the loss of Sanji, but Nami states that he was checking if his heart was beating on the right and he needed to check the left side. On doing that, Usopp became relieved that Sanji's heart was still beating. At that point, Usopp threatens Enel by lying that he has 8,000 followers and will spare Enel's life if he leaves. Enel, upset at Usopp, takes him out with his Goro Goro no Mi. Enel then told Gan Fall that the Divine Squad members, who he seized six years ago, have been working long and hard till this day without rest. He also told Gan Fall that his need for Sky Island is also complete. Enel stated that the people of Skypiea are ignorant in seeing the Upper Yard as only a land of Vearth. He stated that the Straw Hats, his crew and the Shandia all seek the City of Gold.\nAfter his discussion with Gan Fall, Enel left saying he is also a partaker in the final game and responded to Gan Fall's inquiry about his Divine Squad leaving Enel's forced labor as \"something only God knows\". At that moment, Hotori and Kotori, both of whom are brothers of Satori, appeared with the intention of avenging their brother's death. While still engaged in their battle, Luffy tells Wyper that cannons and rifles will not work on him. Wyper, seeing the statement as being true adds a Flavor Dial and his weapon becomes the Burn Bazooka. Luffy and Wyper battle for some time and eventually throw each other off after both launching a Bazooka-like attack on each other. Wyper thought it would be better not to kill Luffy and save his energy to kill Enel. Just as Luffy answers him, Luffy is swallowed by the Giant Python, leaving Wyper to wonder where Luffy had gone.\nGenbo and the Divine Soldiers battle and he easily overwhelms them. Yama then appears before Genbo. Genbo shoots an iron cannonball at Yama, which he dodges and kicks the iron cannonball back and damages Genbo. Genbo, refusing to be defeated, makes Yama launch the Ten-Fold Axe: Axe Mountain attack on Genbo and defeats him.\nWhile on the Going Merry, Nami and Gan Fall prepare for their battle with Kotori and Hotori. Luffy finds himself in an unidentifiable location. Chopper is still searching the ruins for the rest of the exploration crew where he comes in contact with Gedatsu.",

She reports this to Perospero, but to his horror, Big Mom decides to go to Nuts Island instead. Meanwhile, the Big Mom Pirates have invaded the Germa Kingdom.\nBack in the Mirro-World, Katakuri brings out his trident Mogura to attack Luffy.

However, the Sunny crew quickly gets to work locating and breaking all the remaining mirrors on the ship, and the Big Mom Pirates are shocked as they shatter. Mascarpone and Joscarpone think that the Sunny sunk into the ocean which caused the mirrors to shatter, but Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is suspicious about it. Luffy notices the mirrors shattering, and catches Chopper on the other side of the mirror shard in his possession. Luffy runs away from Katakuri and the Big Mom Pirates to talk to them in secret, and Chopper reveals that Jinbe saved them from Big Mom's tidal wave. The crew wonders how Luffy will get back to them, and they make a plan for Luffy to reunite with them on Cacao Island, where they intend to reach in 10 hours at 1:00 AM. However, at that moment, Katakuri assaults Luffy, shattering the mirror shard. Luffy struggles to get away from Katakuri while holding the tiny remnants of the mirror, but is smashed into the ground by a giant mochi axe kick, and his crew is greatly concerned. However, Luffy tries acting like everything is fine and approves the plan to reunite on Cacao Island, causing his crewmates to celebrate.\nIn Sweet City, Count Niwatori asks Mont-d'Or about the status of the Straw Hats, worrying that they may have escaped from Totto Land. However, Mont-d'Or reassures him that the Territorial Sea Slugs will soon sense them, and they along with the Germa Kingdom will be overwhelmed. At the Germa Kingdom, the Big Mom Pirates have begun their assault. Yonji fights Charlotte Basskarte, and initially overpowers him as he easily deals with his flame shots. However, as Yonji charges at him, Basskarte uncovers his mouth and breathes a large stream of fire that consumes the former.\nAs Luffy struggles to get up, Katakuri brings his trident Mogura out of his arm and correctly predicts Luffy's declaration that he will not die here. He mocks this declaration, and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e pops out of a mirror to tell Luffy that he has no hope of beating Katakuri, saying that her brother is a superhuman who has never laid down since he was born. Luffy gets annoyed and tries to punch Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but Katakuri grabs his arm and throws him against the wall. Katakuri then transforms his arm into mochi and uses Mochi Tsuki to twist it around to strike at Luffy with Mogura. Luffy barely dodges the strike, and is awed at the damage left to the wall behind him before being forced to run away as the damage results in the entire section collapsing. As Luffy and Katakuri continue fighting, it turns out that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e had overheard Luffy talking to his crew and found out that they were still alive. She contacts Perospero to tell him about this and reveals the plan to meet on Cacao Island, and this relieves Perospero as he thinks Pudding's cake baking operation on Cacao Island will enable him to cover up his lie. He tells Big Mom to go to Cacao Island, but to his horror, she decides to head to the nearby Nuts Island instead. Back in the Mirro-World, Katakuri maintains his advantage against Luffy by overpowering him with Mogura, and Luffy continues to be unable to lay a hand on him. He tries using Thor Elephant Gun to punch Katakuri into the ground, but Katakuri transforms into mochi to avoid it and after transforming back, he punches Luffy into the air before attempting to strike him with Mochi Tsuki again.",

After Luffy defeats the hostile pirates, he goes with Koby to the pantry to eat the stored food. Luffy explains that he set sail to begin his pirating career, but his dinghy was destroyed by a whirlpool and he was left trapped at sea in a barrel. Koby explains that he was riding on a rowboat, but was kidnapped by the Alvida Pirates and forced to become a chore boy. He explains his desires to escape the Alvida Pirates some day and join the Marines.\nAlvida is informed of Luffy's presence, and, out of suspicion that he could be a bounty hunter, confronts him and Koby in the pantry.

Using a Gomu Gomu no Pistol attack, Luffy defeats Alvida, sending her flying off the ship and into the sea.\nHaving concluded the battle, Luffy boards a dinghy with Koby to continue his travels, catching a glimpse of the female burglar who was also departing the ship on her own dinghy.

Bill reveals to Desire that he used everyone in his Silver Pirate Alliance to give him wealth so that he could live the most luxurious life in the world, and questions whether she really intends to defeat him and if she really believes she is stronger than him. Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill. The Silver Pirate Alliance members attack Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire as Bill prepares to kill them all with a bazooka. However, Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to knock out the pirates and their battle boats, leaving Bill alone and shocked. Luffy sees where Bill is, and Bill fires a cannonball at him, but Luffy shatters it as he punches Bill into the underground mine.\nBill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.\nBartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island. At the coast, the Silver Pirate Alliance and the Sweet Pirates get everyone onto a large ship as they prepare to escape the island's destruction. The Sweet Pirates worry about Desire, but are forced to set sail. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Barto Club are worried about Luffy and Bartolomeo, but Zoro is confident that they are all right since Luffy's vivre card is fine. Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.\nLater in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles. Inside Gran Tesoro, Tanaka arrives and reports to the Monster of the New World, a man named Gild Tesoro. Tanaka reports that Bill sank along with Silver Mine, but Tesoro is fine as he already had his fun with Bill and now was time for the real entertainment to start.",

Just as Dellinger is about to give the finishing blow, Bartolomeo shows up and protects him.\nBellamy is seen panting and hurt badly on the ground, with Bartolomeo having formed a barrier to protect him from Dellinger. Dellinger injures his leg trying to break through the barrier and shouts to Bartolomeo to get out of the way and let him finish his mission, but Bartolomeo refuses. Having been given a new mission by Diamante to go and guard the SMILE factory, Dellinger decides to leave Bellamy be but promises to deal with both of them later. Bellamy wonders why a stranger like Bartolomeo was helping him, to which Bartolomeo replies that once he fights along with someone, he considers him a friend.\nBack at the Flower Hill, Thunder Soldier is briefing everyone about his plan, called Dressrosa Operation SOP. He goes on to explain the existence of a secret underground world operating in Dressrosa, which involves illegal transactions. The factory, which is also tied to the underworld, function with the labor of the captured Tontatta citizens and the people turned to toys. The resistance has been building a secret tunnel, which they will now use to enter the area and destroy the factory. Before that, however, they must succeed in defeating an agent of Doflamingo, in order to make her power lose effect thus returning the toys into their human selves and restoring the citizens' memories. Hopefully, by achieving that, more people would join their cause. When asked by Usopp where that Devil Fruit user is, Thunder Soldier answers she must be at the underground port and, due to her Devil fruit's side effect, which has kept her from aging, she is guarded by Trebol himself. Usopp rejoices, when he hears he is up against a little girl and a pumped up Franky asks the Dwarves to take them to the underground tunnel.\nBack at the Colosseum, Luffy, who was looking for an exit, bumps into Bartolomeo and Bellamy. Bartolomeo, excited to meet his idol again, asks him reluctantly if he met with Zoro. When Luffy states his desire to find an exit, Bellamy tells him that such a thing does not exist in the Colosseum, because it was built in a way to prevent the contestants from escaping once they enter. Luffy, surprised, asks Bellamy to show him the exit, since he must know where it is, being Doflamingo's subordinate. Bellamy shouts he would never betray his captain, but says that he will be heading for the exit himself, so if Luffy was to follow him he could find the exit, too. Bartolomeo wonders why Luffy would give up the fight for the Mera Mera no Mi, to which Luffy replies that his friends' lives are more important. Bartolomeo promises to get the fruit and give it to Luffy, which was his original plan anyway.\nAt that point, a man walks in stating that the fire fruit cannot go to Straw Hat Luffy. Bartolomeo confronts him for speaking to his idol like that, but the man simply pushes him away. Upon looking at the mysterious man, Luffy is greatly shocked and starts shedding tears of joy.\nWhen Luffy finaly finds his way out, he meets with Zoro and Kin'emon again, with the latter providing animal outfits for the three of them, in order to escape the Marines and leave the area unnoticed. Zoro is irritated by Luffy's non-stop crying and tells him to cut it out. Luffy, still sobbing and shocked, wonders how is it possible for \"that man\" to be still alive.\nA young woman is seen sitting on top of a bunch of defeated men, speaking through a Den Den Mushi, stating that Robin is in this country and that she desires to see her again. The woman is none other than Koala, who has become a member of the Revolutionary Army and is a Fish-Man Karate assistant instructor. She goes on to ask the receiver of the call, if he met the man he was looking for and if he had any news on the situation underground. Then the man is shown, who is the same man seen talking to Luffy earlier, wearing \"Lucy\"'s attire, stating that he has to go get Ace's fruit back and inherit his will.\nA flashback of Ace's grave is then shown, with three cups in front of it, confirming that the mysterious man was none other than Sabo, who was presumed to be long dead by his brothers.",

        "long_summary": "After Luffy wasted all their food supplies, the Sanji Retrieval Team is quickly left starving, with Luffy famished to the point of even trying to eat Chopper. Pedro then sees an island from afar, and Nami realizes that it must be the island she spotted on the map in Zou. The team prepares to look for food there, but Pekoms reveals that the island, Fron Island, is home to a Marine base that keeps an eye on Big Mom and is full of hotshots. The team heads for the island's shore in the Shark Submerge III, with Pedro and Pekoms staying behind to guard the Thousand Sunny. On Fron Island, Vice Admiral Prodi and his men watch as a Marine ship carrying reserve forces draws closer to the island. However, an explosion suddenly hits the ship as the soldiers on it target one of their own. The target, Grount, has started attacking everyone, overpowering them with his speed and strength. To finish the rest of his comrades off, Grount activates the metallic attachment on his arm, which causes steam to exude from it and allows him to knock everyone out with extreme speed and power. Grount then jumps close to Prodi and tells him to send back the defeated forces due to them being too weak, which angers Prodi.\nMeanwhile, Brook frightens a group of Marines into unconsciousness with his detached soul, and Luffy, Nami, Chopper, and Carrot put on the Marines' uniforms, though Luffy is hesitant. Brook then heads back to the Submerge, and Nami and Chopper look around the island, seeing the Marine ship that just arrived and also finding the building where the Marines store their food. In the Marine base, Prodi angrily contacts Garp, blaming him for sending Grount to the base, but Garp revealed that Grount requested it himself. After the call ends, Koby wonders to Garp why Grount requested to be stationed in such a remote area. Prodi then berates Grount for his reckless actions, asking the 17-year-old Captain why he asked to be transferred, and Grount stated his intention to take down Big Mom. Prodi is dismissive of Grount's high goals, calling him naive and noting that he served under Aokiji, belittling the former Admiral for deserting the Marines. Grount gets angry at Prodi for mocking Aokiji, having to be held back by Prodi's attendants. Prodi then tells his attendants to let Grount rest a while before he puts him on duty.\nOutside, the Sanji Retrieval Team prepares to sneak into the Marines' food storage, but Luffy and Carrot end up going on ahead to the main base, where they come to the cafeteria. Grount then comes to the cafeteria as well, with his actions on the ship causing him to be ostracized by his comrades. Grount's attitude gets both sides riled up for a fight, but Bonham then steps in. Initially seeming like he would attack Grount, Bonam instead hugged his comrade, having previously served under Aokiji with him. He then pointed Grount to their other old comrade Zappa, who is hunched back and crying into his food due to having been rejected by every girl on the island. As this happens, Luffy and Carrot get excited when they see the food being served to them. Meanwhile, some other Marines find the Marines that the Sanji Retrieval Team knocked out and stripped, and report the scene immediately. Prodi receives the report and immediately tells his men to find the attackers' invasion route, activating every Video Den Den Mushi on the island before racing to the monitor room.\nIn the cafeteria, Grount eats his spicy curry. Nami and Chopper then enter, and are appalled to see Luffy and Carrot out in the open. The kitchen lady then notices the two of them and states they do not look familiar, which scares Nami and Chopper, but she mistakes them for new Marines and happily gives them food. Carrot then sees the two of them and calls out their names loudly, shocking Nami. Zappa hears Nami's name and quickly recognizes her in bewilderment. He then approaches her lovestruck, saying he knows who she is and holding up her bounty poster. Zappa proposes to Nami and tries to kiss her, but ends up kissing the kitchen lady's spoon as Nami runs away into the hall. Chopper goes with Nami as she recovers from the shock of Zappa's advances, and as Zappa starts crying again, Luffy grabs an entire bowl of curry, causing the Marines to shout in bewilderment. In the monitor room, Prodi notices the altercation and quickly recognizes Luffy. He then activates an alarm across the island, telling his forces that Luffy and his crew are here and ordering them to be captured. Meanwhile, Nami and Chopper run out of the Marine base, intent on getting supplies from the food storage room before they leave. Brook hears the alarm and is himself confronted by several Marines. Inside the cafeteria, the Marines confront Luffy and Carrot as Grount excitedly prepares to take Luffy down himself.",

In Ebisu Town, Law's group learns from a newspaper that a funeral for Komurasaki will be held and that Kid escaped from Udon prison, the place where Chopper's group and Big Mom are currently traveling to.\nIn Udon prison, Hyougoro tries to make good use of the meal tickets that Luffy generously gave to him, but Daifugo approaches and torments the elderly man.",
        "long_summary": "Kanjuro meets with Nami's group in a snowy cottage far away from the Flower Capital. Kanjuro states that the most powerful yakuza twenty years ago was Hyougoro, who was far more humane and caring than Kyoshiro was at the party. They also report their findings; Robin was unable to get any useful information, but Brook found a Poneglyph, though it was not red. They decide to go back to the Flower Capital to relax at a bathhouse.\nSanji's group is also hiding in Ebisu Town. They read the news, which tells of Komurasaki's death and Kid's escape from prison. Law predicts that Luffy will be part of an uprising in Udon. However, Sanji asks if there is a bathhouse, causing the others to tackle Sanji. A group of children enters and plays with Sanji's raid suit can.\nThe Big Mom Pirates are back at the bottom of the waterfall. They cannot go back up because King is defending the top. They know that Big Mom survived the fall as Perospero's Vivre Card is still intact, so they decide to wait at the bottom for any news.\nBig Mom and Chopper's group ride on a crocodile towards Udon. Strangely, Kiku forbids Tama and Momonosuke from using the word \"sunacchi,\" stating that it is inappropriate to use. Kiku then explains the structure of Wano Country, which is divided in six regions. Kuri is in the far west and Udon is just east of it. The other four regions are Kibi, a wasteland, the Flower Capital at the center, Ringo, a snowy region, and Hakumai, a port region. Separated from the mainland is an island named Onigashima.\nIn Udon, Luffy once again helps the old man Hyo by breaking rocks and giving him meal tickets. However, he is interrogated by Alpacaman about Kid's escape. Alpacaman, a SMILE fruit user, covers Luffy in smelly spit. Hyo is also beaten by Daifugo, a scorpion SMILE fruit user, for getting his food tickets from someone else. Witnessing the beating, Luffy walks up to confront Daifugo.",

Captain Hina uses her Devil Fruit abilities to also try and catch him, however Luffy escapes quickly and easily, much to the three's chagrin. Luffy battles more vice admirals as they gang up on him along with zombies Gecko Moria resurrects. Seeing Luffy in so much danger, Ace screams at Luffy not to come closer, as they have both lived their lives and adventures according to how they wanted to, so Luffy shouldn't get involved any longer. But, Luffy ignores all of this and continues fighting for Ace, because they are brothers. Annoyed by the turn of the war's tide, Sengoku reveals to all that Luffy is the son of the great Revolutionary Dragon and orders that he must be stopped at all costs. Thoroughly impressed, Whitebeard orders Marco that no harm should come to Luffy.",
        "long_summary": "While everybody is amazed at Luffy, both Koby and Helmeppo begin to talk about his selflessness. Luffy alerts Whitebeard about the plan to execute Ace ahead of schedule. Buggy comments that he hates Luffy's fearlessness and Ivankov claims that only Dragon's son could be so brave. Whitebeard thanks Luffy for the information and everybody is surprised they are talking in equal terms. Luffy begins his assault, breaking through all the Marines in his way. Jozu watches Luffy with joy, and sends his division to follow Luffy. Jinbe, Ivankov, and the Newkamas then leap into battle. The 14th division commanded by Speed Jiru also starts to charge. Garp is surprised that Luffy is in the battlefield as Sengoku speaks his thoughts about how the pirates can be encouraged by Luffy. Sengoku then commands the Marines through Den Den Mushi.\nWhitebeard is very cautious about Sengoku's plan, thinking over what they are planning. Marco alerts Whitebeard of the current situation about Ace and Squard who is tied with the vice admirals at the bay. Whitebeard warns Marco not to fall into Sengoku's trap as Sengoku is not a man who would make mistakes easily. The 14th division is assaulted by Kizaru who then sees Luffy close by, and decides to attack him. Ivankov saves Luffy by pushing him away with a Death Wink. Buggy and his followers begin to panic. When the Impel Down prisoners mistook Buggy's attitude as bravery, Galdino starts to scold them. Bartholomew Kuma then attacks Ivankov with his beams. After evading the beams, Ivankov is surprised about \"how he can attack him since they known each other for so long\". Ivankov tells Luffy to let him handle Kuma, and Luffy presses forward.\nFullbody and Jango prepare to attack Luffy, who does not remember them at first until he recalls their humiliation, which angers them, and by pure luck, he is able to avoid Jango's hypnotism by looking at a nearby explosion. Both Fullbody and Jango fell to Jango's hypnotism and are then kicked away by Hina, whom Luffy recognizes from Alabasta. Hina tries to imprison Luffy, but he manages to get past her using Gear Second. The Squard Pirates are having difficulties with the vice admirals, and Squard tries to sneak into the plaza to rescue Ace, but he sees a \"mysterious figure\" before proceeding. Luffy fights with several strong Marines, whom he is able to defeat with some difficulty. Gecko Moria commends Luffy's powers, and plans to once again take his shadow, this time for Oars Jr. and sends his army of zombies after him. Luffy tries to avoid conflict with Moria, but is soon stopped by an increasing number of zombies. Kizaru sends more Marines after him, wondering how long can Luffy last.\nAce shows his concern for Luffy and tells him to retreat, which surprises Boa Hancock and Marco. Ace starts to berate Luffy for getting into other's affairs. Luffy replies that they are brothers and he does not care about the code of pirates. Marines start to wonder if Luffy may be another son of Gol D. Roger. Luffy is then attacked by Moria's zombies, but they are subdued by Jinbe who uses seawater to defeat them. Jinbe tells Luffy that he will handle Moria. One of the giants attempts to crush Luffy as Sengoku tells everybody about Luffy's relationship with Ace as an adoptive brother and reveals that Luffy is the son of Dragon, which greatly shocks everybody. Smoker is now able to understand why Dragon saved Luffy at Loguetown.\nThis revelation greatly surprises the people at Sabaody Archipelago and prompts the Marines to kill Luffy. Garp does not mind since Luffy is already a well-known pirate. Luffy is able to defeat the giant with Gear Third, and shouts at Ace that he will save him \"even if it means death\" which prompts the Whitebeard Pirates to appreciate him due to their common goal, and Whitebeard tells Marco they \"cannot let him die\". Ace looks surprised at Luffy.",

Luffy confuses the Marines guarding the entrance gate by manipulating one of their own comrades to fight against them. The Franky Family and the Galley La Company comes in while the Straw Hat Pirates are still in the sea train. Because they are not all quite as limber as Luffy, they have to band together to get inside. Giant Gate Keepers Kashii and Oimo come to fight the Franky Family.",
        "long_summary": "Spandam receives a report with the Marine saying there are a bunch of people charging through the main gate and they need reinforcements. The Franky Family charge in riding on Sodom and Gomorrah and blast away at some Marines. Spandam demands to know what is going on. Past the main gate, the Franky Family's largest members, the Kairiki Destroyers are the first to get off and begin fighting through the Marines. Meanwhile, Robin is seen turning around with a concerned look on her face and Rob Lucci tells her it is too late to have second thoughts. Robin and the rest of CP9 with Franky continue to walk on.\nJust outside Enies Lobby, the other Straw Hat Pirates are seen preparing on the Rocketman. Kokoro then says over the loud speaker that they have four minutes left before they charge through.\nMeanwhile, Luffy walks up to a group of Marines and politely asks them if he could pass, but a Marine charges in toward Luffy with a spear. However, Luffy dodges it and uses a new, unique move known as Gomu Gomu no Mikata Robo that allows him to \"control\" the captured Marine. Luffy uses the captured Marine to take down some Marines who says he cannot control his actions. Two Marines attempt to attack Luffy from behind but Luffy escapes and the two Marines attack the previously captured Marine instead. Luffy escapes over the second gate telling the Marines they will have more people to fight later.\nThe Marines are forced to tell Spandam that Luffy has made it to the main island. Spandam is furious wanting to know what happened to Kashii and Oimo thinking they have been taken out as well. The Marine, however, says that they may be sleeping and Spandam angrily tells the Marine to wake them up. Jabra wonders why everyone is throwing a riot over one intruder, but says he and the others will take care of him. Spandam says that is not necessary as Enies Lobby is the way to the World Government and is a symbol of justice. Spandam continues saying it will be an embarrassment if the Straw Hats manage to save their one crewmate and promises that the Straw Hats will pay.\nBack at the main gate, Spandam demands to know what is going on from the gatekeeper. However, the gatekeeper has been knocked out as the Franky Family and Galley-La take out some Marines. Paulie takes out a group using Rope Action: Figure of Eight Knot while Zambai smashes some with his cannon not wanting to waste any ammo on the weaker men. Paulie tells the others to open the main gate and Mozu and Kiwi agree to do so. Peepley Lulu takes out a Marine while Tilestone bear-hugs some others. Mozu and Kiwi manage to pick the locks using their swords and the Kairiki Destroyers push open the large doors. The Franky Family celebrate pushing open the door and they all rush through. Zambai suddenly yells out to some of the others that he has a plan and needs help. As the members of the Franky Family proceed, they are ambushed by the two giants Kashii and Oimo. Kashii and Oimo taunt the Franky Family due to their size and the Kairiki Destroyers agree to fight them. However, even the largest members of the Franky Family are no match for two giants and are effortlessly taken out much to the surprise and shock of the rest of the Franky Family. Kashii and Oimo continue to taunt the Franky Family, saying they will not let them pass, but the Franky Family are determined to save Franky. Back outside the gates, Kokoro says that they have two minutes before charging in. Meanwhile, Luffy finds himself surrounded by many Marines and government agents. One of them taunts Luffy saying they have 10,000 soldiers. Luffy cracks his knuckles preparing for a fight and tells the Marines to get out of his way.",

Luffy makes the first move as he activates Gear 2 and rushes at Cracker, but Cracker easily blocks Luffy's attacks with his sword and shield. Cracker then attacks, and to Luffy's shock he finds that Cracker has suddenly gained extra limbs and swords. Cracker attacks Luffy with three of his swords, sending him flying into a tree homie close to Nami and Pound. Cracker approaches the trio now with four arms each holding a sword, shocking Nami. He reveals that he can add extra limbs and weapons to his body by tapping it, adding even more arms and creating more swords and shields, as well as creating more legs. Luffy attacks Cracker again, only to be blown back by Cracker's increased defenses, and Nami tells Luffy not to engage in combat, as their goal is to retrieve Sanji as quickly as possible. However, Luffy states that he can only ever go all out in combat, and Cracker laughs at Luffy. He then boasts in his one-of-a-kind sword Pretzel, and Nami points out that he is holding six swords, which angers Cracker as he charges at the two Straw Hats. Luffy activates Gear 3 and clashes with Cracker, but still has no luck breaking through his defenses. Cracker overwhelms Luffy as he rapidly jabs at him with his multiple swords, and eventually catches Luffy in the chest with a spinning thrust called Roll Pretzel, which breaks through Luffy's Armament Haki defense and sends him flying a great distance through the Seducing Woods. Cracker pursues Luffy, causing massive amounts of destruction in his wake, and Nami chases after the two. However, she and Pound are confronted by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Kingbaum, who decide to take care of the two of them.\nNami steps back from the giant Kingbaum in fear, and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e mocks the Straw Hats and the other members of the Worst Generation, revealing that Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, Capone Bege, and Urouge had all previously invaded Totto Land. Except for Bege, who had allied himself to the Big Mom Pirates, all of the Supernovas had been chased away without seeing or even hearing Big Mom herself. The only one who made an impact in his invasion was Urouge, who managed to defeat one of the Sweet Commanders back when there were four of them. However, a massive storm hit as Big Mom sent a large fleet after Urouge, with Cracker in command. Urouge fought Cracker, and was unable to penetrate his defenses, even when he expanded his muscles with his Devil Fruit power. Cracker was underwhelmed by Urouge, and used Roll Pretzel to defeat him. Now, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e speculates that Urouge's body is lying around somewhere, and she creates a mirror before throwing it down by Nami's feet. She then disappears and reappears in the mirror, boasting in the power of the Four Emperors as she emerges and expands the mirror, grabbing Nami by the ankle. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e drags Nami into the Mirro-World, and Nami screams. Pound is initially overtaken with fear, but when Nami calls to him for help, he eventually builds up resolve and attacks Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. She dodges his punch, but releases Nami, and proclaims to her stepfather that he has made himself an enemy of Big Mom and her crew. However, Nami unleashes a weather egg to create a storm cloud and strike Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with lightning, stunning the woman as she falls into the Mirro-World and her mirror disappears. Pound states that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e will be back, and Nami apologizes for forcing his hand, but Pound sadly reflects that Big Mom already considers him an enemy due to authorizing Cracker to execute him. He then asks if Nami is friends with Lola, which she affirms, and Nami states that she now knows the Vivre Card Lola gave her points to Big Mom. As a result, it can also repel the homies, and Nami intends to use the card to its full extent.\nMeanwhile, Cracker catches up to Luffy, who is back up and intent on continuing the fight. Cracker attacks with Roll Pretzel again, but Luffy dodges the strike and barrages Cracker with Gear 2 kicks. Cracker maintains his defense, but is pushed back a bit; however, he proclaims that Luffy's attacks have no effect on him as he charges at Luffy. The nearby homies run in fear as the two clash, and Cracker tells Luffy to give up, but Luffy refuses as he is intent on seeing Sanji.",

        "air_date": "July 18, 2010",
        "short_summary": "Only three hours remain until Ace's execution. Luffy reaches Marineford but finds the Gates of Justice closed. While Garp is thinking about his talk with Gol D. Roger, Fleet Admiral Sengoku reveals to the whole world that Ace is the son of none other than Gol D. Roger.",
        "long_summary": "With the execution three hours away, Ace unchained from the wall. He looks down thinking of his childhood with Luffy and walks down the hallway with the guards holding him tight. He looks up the long stairway and climbs the stairs.\nIn the South Blue, the civilians worry that Whitebeard will reach Marineford before long. As Whitebeard is widely known throughout the years, an elderly woman reads the newspapers that Marineford has tightened security. In the East Blue, a shepherd senses that Marineford is impenetrable, but one civilian says the fort was attacked before, 20 years ago by Shiki the Golden Lion, leaving much the headquarters in ruin. The battle today would be far worse.\nIn the North Blue, a man refuses to open his bar at the time of war. In the West Blue, some bar patrons talk about the time they saw Whitebeard. Somewhere in the Grand Line, some kids sing about Whitebeard while one woman prays for salvation.\nAt Marineford, the city is vacated to prepare for the intense war with Whitebeard as the civilians have been evacuated to the Sabaody Archipelago. The civilians wait to watch Ace's capital punishment with journalists ready to spread the news. A reporter named Reuder wonders if Whitebeard wants a war.\nEvery ship sent to find Whitebeard has been sunk.\nIn the main building, Garp bangs Sengoku's desk but Sengoku reminds him that Ace's execution is for the good of the world. The responsibility is on Garp's shoulders, but he simply smiles and walks out.\nMarineford is surrounded by fifty Marine ships and one-hundred thousand Marine soldiers at the docks. The execution is to take three hours and hope it will be over. There are also cannons set up to bombard enemies, and finally, the Shichibukai stand at the ready. Finally, the three admirals arrive to take their seats and guard the scaffold, Aokiji, Akainu and Kizaru. The massive force of justice is gathered to ensure Ace is executed no matter what.\nAs Ace continues to climb the stairs, he remembers when he told Luffy to enjoy life without regret and hoped to head out to sea free than anyone else. He arrives outside over the catcalls of the marines.\nOn the hijacked Marine ship, Luffy sees the Gates of Justice and calls to Jinbei. The fish-man sees that the gate is shut tight and wonders how to get through. Buggy announces his intentions to conquer the world by taking down Marine Headquarters, killing Whitebeard and become the new Pirate King.\nAce sees the scaffold and walks towards it. The crowd at Sabaody see the action that is intensifying. Any wrong move could trigger the war. The Fire Fist pirate kneels on the scaffold and two swords prepare to finally execute him. Sengoku and Garp walk to the scaffold as well, and the former brings a Den Den Mushi at Ace's side. He announces something shocking; Portgas D. Ace, who is to be executed, needs to give out the name of his father. Ace says his father's name is Whitebeard, but the admiral says that thanks to Cipher Pol, they found out about Ace's father, but not his mother. His biological mother, Portgas D. Rouge, misled the entire world. Ace was born on Batelira in the South Blue. Rouge kept her baby in her womb for 20 months and died after the childbirth.\nYears ago, Gol D. Roger told Garp to look after his child.\nSengoku reveals that Ace's biological father is Gol D. Roger, the former Pirate King. The Sabaody crowd watches in shock. Reuder realizes that Roger's bloodline still lives. Ace growls at the revelation.",

However, the Shichibukai reveals that his Devil Fruit has awakened, and he overwhelms Luffy by turning the surrounding area into string. Meanwhile, the people on Dressrosa continue running from the Birdcage, but start losing hope. However, Riku Doldo III galvanizes them by revealing that only Doflamingo remained standing and that Luffy would free them.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy's Gear 4 punch sends Doflamingo flying through several buildings, and the citizens below stare in awe, deciding to cheer Luffy on despite not knowing who he is. On the Flower Field, Cavendish watches Luffy's new form in astonishment, but Law says that Luffy is overusing his Haki, confusing Cavendish. On the palace rooftop, Jesus Burgess searches for Luffy and sees him bouncing through the town. Koala, who hides behind a pile of rubble, remembers Burgess from the Corrida Colosseum and wonders what he wants with Luffy. Meanwhile, Viola, Hack, and Usopp have reached the Corrida Colosseum, and Viola contacts Riku Doldo III. Doldo asks if Doflamingo was the only one left standing, which Viola confirms.\nIn the streets below, Zoro runs toward the Birdcage when he is confronted by Kin'emon and Kanjuro. The samurai reveal that he is going in the wrong direction and tell him to get on Kanjuro's sparrow, which is struggling to carry the two samurai. Zoro gets on, causing the sparrow to strain extremely hard in order to start flying again. Meanwhile, the Birdcage reaches the SMILE Factory, and Franky sees this and tells the dwarves inside to evacuate the destroyed facility. As they exit the factory, they realize that the Birdcage is not cutting it up, which Franky realizes is because of it being made of Seastone. Zoro and the samurai then arrive, and Franky tells them that the center of town is the other way. However, Zoro reveals his intention to stop the Birdcage, leaving the dwarves in awe. As the three swordsmen fly away, Franky thinks about their plan and gets an idea.\nMeanwhile, Luffy hovers in midair and looks at Doflamingo, who is still lying on the ground and pondering Luffy's Gear 4 capabilities. Luffy decides to finish Doflamingo off now in order to avoid overusing Gear 4, and Doflamingo gets up and remarks that it must take a lot for Luffy to maintain that form. Luffy retracts both fists into his forearms to unleash a powerful attack, but Doflamingo suddenly blocks it by creating two waves of string from the ground. Luffy is shocked by Doflamingo's sudden move, and the Shichibukai reveals that his Devil Fruit has awakened, allowing him to turn his surroundings into string. Doflamingo turns more and more buildings into string and presses his attack on Luffy, who comments that this makes Doflamingo's fruit no longer look like a Paramecia, and is unable to overcome the constant barrages of string.\nThe citizens of Dressrosa continue running from the Birdcage, but those who are unable to run properly find the cage catching up to them, and a mother has lost her son. People are trapped under rubble, and medics continue wheeling people out of a hospital, begging the running citizens to help to no avail. One man decides to sit on the ground, giving up hope that they would be saved. Suddenly, Doldo broadcasts himself to the entire island. He reminds them that the shrinking Birdcage was not a dream, saying that they had been under a cage ever since Doflamingo had taken over ten years ago. However, every member of the Donquixote Pirates except Doflamingo himself had been taken down, and Luffy was currently fighting Doflamingo. Doldo tells the citizens that their nightmare would soon end, and urges them to keep running from the Birdcage no matter their condition, as there was still hope. This galvanizes the people, and the handicapped begin running again despite their ailments. Citizens, Marines, and pirates alike start helping free people from rubble and carting off the hospitalized people, knowing they would be saved as Luffy continues his battle with Doflamingo.",

The giant screams in pain because he just got bitten by a T. rex from the back. He chops the T. rex head and introduces himself as Brogy, claiming to be the strongest warrior of Elbaf. He also calls Nami and Usopp as guests but, frightened, the two play dead.\nElsewhere, Luffy and Vivi are exploring. Luffy comments the view on top of the Brachiosaurus and says he wants to have lunch in there. Luffy then starts to play along the necks of the Brachiosaurus and gets eaten by one of them. A giant slashes the neck of the dinosaur and catches Luffy with his hand and tells him he has been watching him. The giant introduces himself as Dorry, Elbaf's strongest warrior. Luffy introduces himself, Vivi, and Karoo before Dorry invites them to his home.\nBrogy takes Usopp and Nami to his place, where he is roasting dinosaur meat to treat them as his guests. They, however, fearing to be eaten themselves, try to escape through the jungle. Either way, after being chased by larger and larger predators, they end up back at Brogy's feet.\nBack to Dorry, he tells Luffy, Karoo, and Vivi that he is engaged in a duel that has lasted one hundred years. Whenever the island's central volcano erupts, the two face each other in combat.\nMeanwhile in the jungle, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine join forces with Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek, who plot to earn the giants' huge bounties.",
