Episode 284,The Blueprints Aren't Passed! Franky's Decision,"November 5, 2006","After Robin decides she wants to live, the Straw Hat Pirates wait for the bridge, so they can battle CP9. Franky reveals that the Pluton blueprints are with him and burns them in front of Spandam, saying that he's betting it all on the Straw Hats. With unexpected help from Kokoro, Franky and the Straw Hats make a dramatic entrance into the Tower of Justice.","We rewind to the point just after Robin tearfully declares she wants to live. Back at the Courthouse, Mozu and Kiwi finally make it to the drawbridge levers atop the towers and throw them. The Straw Hats feel the rumble and realize the drawbridge to the Tower of Justice is lowering. Soon the gap will be closed, and the Straw Hats can advance. CP9 stands defiant, ready for the challenge. Back at the Courthouse, Baskerville declares he will stop the drawbridge. Zambai and Paulie attempt to counterattack, but a shocking fact is revealed. Baskerville isn't one Three-Headed Judge but three judges in a single costume. Because of this, the attacks miss, and Center Baskerville is able to order a trench mortar fired on the drawbridge, jamming it partway. Without a clear path, Spandam can still escape to the Gates of Justice.
But then, Franky decides to make a play of his own. He reveals something Spandam had been seeking for a long time: the plans to Pluton. Spandam and CP9 suddenly realize they'd been tricked. Franky had been concealing the plans within his cyborg body the whole time. Spandam demands Franky hand them over, but instead Franky talks to Nico Robin, admitting that he'd misjudged her based on the rumors of her past. The one thing he and the rest of Water 7 had feared the most was the forbidden knowledge she kept in her head. That and the plans in his hand are the only means by which to reconstruct a weapon of mass destruction. The only reason Water 7 had been keeping the plans was in case she or someone tapped into her knowledge and built a Pluton; then it would take another Pluton to counter it. For years, the shipwrights feared Robin because she was a wildcard: a lonely, shunned individual who could be exploited to tragic end. But now, for the first time, Robin is not alone. The Straw Hats stand with her and have already declared their intention to defend her to the end. Knowing this, and knowing the peculiar situation he's in, Franky decides to make a bet. Silently praying that Tom would've understood what he is about to do, he holds the Pluton plans before him...and burns them to ashes in a blast of Fresh Fire. Spandam and CP9 are shocked again as Franky ruins their five-year espionage mission in a stroke. With the World Government actively seeking them, the plans were no longer of value as a countermeasure, so Franky denied them the prize to prevent them being turned against the wishes of the shipwrights. With the plans destroyed, there's only one way left to build Pluton: Robin's knowledge. His bet is that the Straw Hats will rescue Robin: in doing so denying the World Government their last chance to gain access to the weapon. Franky is now siding with the Straw Hats to help ensure this. Suddenly, Franky hears familiar voices from the Courthouse. It's Zambai and the Franky Family, cheering him on. Franky realizes he, too, is not alone. Finally driven to the point of rage, Spandam attacks Franky, sending him over the broken balcony and into the abyss...
At that moment, Kokoro's voice sounds from Nami's Den Den Mushi. She has Rocketman running again, and it's making its way to the Courthouse. Kokoro tells the Straw Hats to get ready to jump into the abyss. The Straw Hats are confused at first, but once they hear Rocketman's whistle, Luffy realizes what's happening. He stretches his arms to envelop the others and takes the leap off the Courthouse roof. As the Straw Hats and Franky fall, Rocketman appears at the drawbridge and speeds upward at full tilt, flying off the end and into the air. Luffy steers himself and the rest of the Straw Hats to land atop the midair Rocketman, and the train manages to catch Franky on its dented nose. Rocketman continues its flight, and Spandam (to his horror) and CP9 (to their delight) realize it's going to make it. Kokoro contemplates a sense of déjà vu. Many years ago, Tom's Workers built a ship for a certain audacious pirate by the name of Gold Roger. And today, here are Tom's Workers helping another audacious pirate in Luffy.","Kashii, Oimo, Just Eleven Jurymen (K.O.), Mozu, Peepley Lulu, Tilestone, Kiwi, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Sogeking, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 285,Retrieve the 5 Keys! The Straw Hat Crew vs. CP9,"November 12, 2006","The Straw Hats and Franky make it to the Tower of Justice. However, Fukurou reveals that one of the CP9 members has the key to Robin's handcuffs, but will not say which, so the Straw Hats must fight every member to find the key. Meanwhile, Chimney follows Spandam, Rob Lucci, and Robin down a secret corridor.","Rocketman crashes into the front wall of the Tower of Justice. Spandam orders Rob Lucci to accompany him and Robin to the Gates of Justice, and tells the rest of CP9 to destroy the Straw Hat Pirates. He summons Funkfreed, and the elephant morphs into a sword. He tells Robin that the sword was imbued with the power of the Zou Zou no Mi Devil Fruit.
Franky makes it to the remains of Rocketman and pulls out Kokoro, Chimney and Gonbe. Although he frets over them a moment, they awaken with only nosebleeds for injuries. Luffy then jumps out of the rubble, and orders the rest of his crew to do the same. Sanji remarks that, while Luffy may be a rubber man, the rest of the crew couldn't possibly be okay after an entrance like that. Then he, Chopper, Sogeking, Zoro, and Nami pop out of the ruins as if nothing happened. Franky says the entire crew is weird.
The crew prepare to begin the battle, but are stopped by Fukurou. He says Robin is already on her way to the Gates of Justice, and CP9 have been ordered to stop them. He reveals that each of the present CP9 members has a key to Seastone handcuffs. One of the keys will open Robin's handcuffs, but he won't say who has the correct key. Nami explains the effect of Seastone on Devil Fruit users to Franky, and Chopper notes that's why Robin wasn't fighting back.
Luffy tries to hit Fukurou, but he uses Soru to dodge, then escapes with Geppo. Before he departs, Fukurou says the Straw Hats will have to fight CP9 for the keys, or they will throw the keys into the ocean. Zoro and Sogeking hold back an eager Luffy while Sanji figures out a battle plan. He allows Luffy to go ahead and catch up with Robin. The remaining six will take the other members of CP9 at the Tower of Justice. Chimney and Gonbe run off, and explore a secret passageway. Although briefly frightened by bats, they hear Spandam in the distance. As he gloats about the Straw Hats not even knowing how to get to the Gates of Justice, the child and rabbit decide to shadow him. Luffy is shown running a maze of staircases before Spandam is shown at a mechanical gate to an underwater passage toward the Gates of Justice.
Franky looks for a kitchen, hoping to recharge on cola before he begins the fight. He reaches the kitchen, but is intercepted by Fukurou. In a dungeon-like hallway, Nami is met by Kumadori, but initially all he does is stomp his staff on the ground in a kabuki display. Sogeking checks the rooms of another hallway, and finds Jabra asleep in a garden room, with key #1 luckily out in the open. Sanji enters a bathhouse room, and is closed in by Kalifa. She offers him tea, and he is quickly smitten by her beauty.
The episode ends with Zoro finding Kaku in the library. Kaku notes Zoro has already drawn his swords. Zoro responds that they're thirsty for blood.","Tony Tony Chopper, Sogeking, Nami, Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 286,Power of the Devil Fruit! Kaku and Jabra Transform,"November 19, 2006","Zoro begins his intense battle with Kaku, while Sogeking fails to retrieve the key from a sleeping Jabra. Kaku reveals his Devil Fruit power and causes the floor to collapse in the process. Meanwhile, Luffy searches high and low in the Tower of Justice, and attempts to cross the whirlpools to the Bridge of Hesitation.","The initial confrontations between the Straw Hat Pirates and CP9 continue to develop. Kumadori continues his kabuki showboating before Nami. Deciding she is at a disadvantage, Nami simply asks for the key. Although he offers to show it, he seems to have misplaced it, to Nami's irritation. In the bathhouse room, Sanji opines that the water Kalifa is using to make tea for them isn't warm enough, and offers his expertise as a chef to make it properly.
Meanwhile, Luffy finally makes it to the point where CP9 was located at their initial confrontation. Naturally, they're not there. He now has to figure out how to get to the Gates of Justice.
Back at the library, Zoro believes Kaku is the one that actually has the key to Robin's handcuffs. Kaku responds he can feel the beastly difference in Zoro's power since their first battle at Galley-La Company headquarters. While Zoro is fearsome, Kaku says he is CP9's best swordsman, and should not be taken lightly. Zoro initially believes him to be of a two-sword style, until Kaku uses Rankyaku slashes from his legs. Kaku states that Rankyaku enables him to use Four Sword Style. Zoro remembers that his training makes Kaku's entire body a weapon.
The first sword exchange between Zoro and Kaku commences, and they clash swords repeatedly. Their first exchange of sword attacks evenly matches Niitoryuu 72-Pound Cannon against Rankyaku Hakurai. Kaku tries to use Soru to get the jump on Zoro, but is defended. A quick retaliatory slash from Zoro barely nicks Kaku's jacket, illiciting a chuckle from him. Zoro says he has no time for jokes. Kaku responds by planting his swords in the ceiling and using Rankyaku Ran to rain a multitude of slashes down at Zoro. After Zoro successfully defends that attack, Kaku decides to unveil his Devil Fruit power, and begins to transform.
In the garden room, Sogeking tries to tiptoe toward Jabra, hoping to take advantage of him sleeping to get key #1 before he notices. But the room seems to be aligning against him. First, his nose is stung by a bee. Then, he feels like his heart stops. Finally, he is confronted by a chicken. But instead of crowing, it chirps, illiciting a facefault from the sniper. Jabra wakes up, and punches Sogeking across the room. He recalls his adversary shooting down the World Government flag, complimenting his shooting ability. He then transforms, revealing he ate the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Wolf, becoming a wolfman. He offers to end the fight quickly by tearing out Sogeking's throat, but the sniper swallows his fear and prepares to fight.
They are interrupted when the ceiling collapses above them. Down falls Zoro along with a large giraffe. Kaku, trying to morph into his beastman form, instead became a full giraffe. Jabra laughs at his comrade's new form, as Zoro wonders if Enies Lobby is a zoo. While Jabra and Kaku bicker over the latter's new form, courtesy the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Giraffe, Sogeking hides, determining that Zoro might be able to take them both. Looking around, he finds some unused pairs of seastone handcuffs.
Kaku gives his transformation another try, and finds his giraffeman form. This startles Zoro, who says Kaku looks funny. Jabra can't stop laughing, even though he tries. The scene is briefly paused when Sogeking tries to throw a pair of seastone handcuffs at one of the beastmen, but gets it on one of Zoro's wrists instead. He says he was distracted by Kaku's beastman form. Fed up with the mockery, Kaku spins on an arm, then uses a Rankyaku slash from his neck, which shoots all around, an attack he calls Amanedachi. Those present are barely able to dodge.
The attack cuts the Tower of Justice in half, with the top half of the tower sliding off-kilter, exposing the garden room to the sky. Kaku grins at his handiwork, having shut the naysayers up.","Kumadori, Nami, Sanji, Kalifa, Monkey D.
