Episode 265,Luffy Charges In! Great Decisive Battle on the Judiciary Island!!,4-Jun-06,"Spandam is informed that an intruder has entered the area. Luffy confuses the Marines guarding the entrance gate by manipulating one of their own comrades to fight against them. The Franky Family and the Galley La Company comes in while the Straw Hat Pirates are still in the sea train. Because they are not all quite as limber as Luffy, they have to band together to get inside. Giant Gate Keepers Kashii and Oimo come to fight the Franky Family.","Spandam receives a report with the Marine saying there are a bunch of people charging through the main gate and they need reinforcements. The Franky Family charge in riding on Sodom and Gomorrah and blast away at some Marines. Spandam demands to know what is going on. Past the main gate, the Franky Family's largest members, the Kairiki Destroyers are the first to get off and begin fighting through the Marines. Meanwhile, Robin is seen turning around with a concerned look on her face and Rob Lucci tells her it is too late to have second thoughts. Robin and the rest of CP9 with Franky continue to walk on.
Just outside Enies Lobby, the other Straw Hat Pirates are seen preparing on the Rocketman. Kokoro then says over the loud speaker that they have four minutes left before they charge through.
Meanwhile, Luffy walks up to a group of Marines and politely asks them if he could pass, but a Marine charges in toward Luffy with a spear. However, Luffy dodges it and uses a new, unique move known as Gomu Gomu no Mikata Robo that allows him to ""control"" the captured Marine. Luffy uses the captured Marine to take down some Marines who says he cannot control his actions. Two Marines attempt to attack Luffy from behind but Luffy escapes and the two Marines attack the previously captured Marine instead. Luffy escapes over the second gate telling the Marines they will have more people to fight later.
The Marines are forced to tell Spandam that Luffy has made it to the main island. Spandam is furious wanting to know what happened to Kashii and Oimo thinking they have been taken out as well. The Marine, however, says that they may be sleeping and Spandam angrily tells the Marine to wake them up. Jabra wonders why everyone is throwing a riot over one intruder, but says he and the others will take care of him. Spandam says that is not necessary as Enies Lobby is the way to the World Government and is a symbol of justice. Spandam continues saying it will be an embarrassment if the Straw Hats manage to save their one crewmate and promises that the Straw Hats will pay.
Back at the main gate, Spandam demands to know what is going on from the gatekeeper. However, the gatekeeper has been knocked out as the Franky Family and Galley-La take out some Marines. Paulie takes out a group using Rope Action: Figure of Eight Knot while Zambai smashes some with his cannon not wanting to waste any ammo on the weaker men. Paulie tells the others to open the main gate and Mozu and Kiwi agree to do so. Peepley Lulu takes out a Marine while Tilestone bear-hugs some others. Mozu and Kiwi manage to pick the locks using their swords and the Kairiki Destroyers push open the large doors. The Franky Family celebrate pushing open the door and they all rush through. Zambai suddenly yells out to some of the others that he has a plan and needs help. As the members of the Franky Family proceed, they are ambushed by the two giants Kashii and Oimo. Kashii and Oimo taunt the Franky Family due to their size and the Kairiki Destroyers agree to fight them. However, even the largest members of the Franky Family are no match for two giants and are effortlessly taken out much to the surprise and shock of the rest of the Franky Family. Kashii and Oimo continue to taunt the Franky Family, saying they will not let them pass, but the Franky Family are determined to save Franky. Back outside the gates, Kokoro says that they have two minutes before charging in. Meanwhile, Luffy finds himself surrounded by many Marines and government agents. One of them taunts Luffy saying they have 10,000 soldiers. Luffy cracks his knuckles preparing for a fight and tells the Marines to get out of his way.","Spandam, Sodom, Gomorrah, Kairiki Destroyers, Nico Robin, Rob Lucci, Franky, Kaku, Blueno, Kalifa, Sanji, Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Sogeking, Tony Tony Chopper, Kokoro, Monkey D.

Episode 266,Battle with the Giants! Open the Second Door!,11-Jun-06,"In a David and Goliath turn around, the Franky Family and Galley-La Company bring down Kashii. Spandam receives an incomplete report about Monkey D. Luffy and believes that he is no longer a threat. The CP9 members meet with Spandam, except it is more of a comedy routine than a meeting. The Rocketman is ready to enter the island.","Even after the Kairiki Destroyers are defeated by Oimo and Kashii, the members of the Franky Family continue fighting the giants. With Mozu and Kiwi's Ship's Bottom Dismantling Cut, Paulie's Rope Action, and Zambai's bazooka, Kashii is finally defeated. He is then nailed down by Peepley Lulu and Tilestone. Oimo then takes on the remaining fighters, while Luffy takes out five hundred soldiers on his own.
Meanwhile, the members of CP9 meet together in the first full reunion in five years. Fukurou measures the physical strength of the CP9 members. He is shocked to find that Lucci is the strongest, measuring at 4000 doriki (a measurement unit of strength where an average soldier is 10 doriki.) Jabra complains that he was ranked lower than Kaku, and he and Lucci begin bickering.
After the members of CP9 finish fighting, Spandam addresses them. He commends them for capturing Nico Robin and Cutty Flam. He mentions a reward he intends to give them, but does not give it to them at the moment. Meanwhile, Robin reflects on the happy moments she spent with the Straw Hats.
Outside in the city, Luffy continues being chased by the Marines and World Government, while the Rocketman prepares to arrive at Enies Lobby.","Kashii, Oimo, Kairiki Destroyers, Schollzo, Kiev, Tamagon, Mozu, Kiwi, Zambai, Sodom, Gomorrah, Paulie, Peepley Lulu, Tilestone, Spandam, Monkey D.

Episode 267,"The Means of Escaping is Opened! Fly through the Sky, Rocketman!",18-Jun-06,"While Nico Robin and Franky are brought before Spandam, Luffy blasts his way through another wave of Marines. In order to get past the gate, Zoro orders that they just keep going. Yokozuna bends down the outside gates and they fly over the gate by using it as a ramp inside. Back on the ground, Paulie is stabbed by someone from the Watchdog Unit of the Law. The Rocketman flies over the gate and the point of the train smashes into Oimo's back, knocking him out cold.","The Rocketman is nearing Enies Lobby. Meanwhile, Nico Robin and Franky are brought before Spandam, the leader of CP9. Spandam mocks Tom for rebelling against the government. Franky then attacks Spandam by biting him. Kumadori defended Spandam by striking Franky's chains with his staff.
On the streets, Luffy defeats another wave of Marines and World Government agents. He runs near the top of the building, rips out a portion of wall, throws it into the air, and uses his Gatling Gun move to cause the wall to turn into rubble flying in all directions.
The remaining Marines approach Baskerville, a group of three people dressed up as a single person. They tell Baskerville that Kashi has been defeated, and that Oimo is being overwhelmed by the remaining fighters. Baskerville sends one hundred men from the Watchdog Unit to the area.
At the gate, Oimo is distracted by the Franky Family while Mozu and Kiwi manage to unlock the gate. Oimo tries to stop them from getting past the gate but is restrained by Paulie's Rope Action. The King Bulls pull the rope, causing Oimo to spin.
Meanwhile, the Rocketman finally reaches Enies Lobby. Yokozuna pushes on the gate, allowing the Rocketman to ride over the fence. The train is sent flying into the air. Meanwhile, the Franky Family finally defeats Oimo. Paulie advances past the gate with the others, only to be stabbed in the shoulder by a member of the Watchdog Unit. Oimo also wakes up, only to be knocked back out by the Rocketman crashing into him.
The Straw Hats emerge from the Rocketman and defeat the Marines and agents. The remaining agents corner Luffy near the end of a cliff. Luffy screams at the agents and tells them to stay out of his way.","Nico Robin, Franky, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Kaku, Jabra, Kumadori, Fukurou, Blueno, Kalifa, Spandam, Monkey D.

Episode 268,Catch Up with Luffy! The Straw Hat Pirates' All-Out War,25-Jun-06,"The Straw Hat Pirates enter an all-out war to catch up with Luffy. Sanji and Zoro bicker over who's stronger, Nami injures her own comrades with her improved weapon, and Sogeking fails at being a decoy. The Watchdog Unit of the Law show up to stop them and the foremen of Galley-La Company stay behind to fight.","Luffy being surrounded by thousands of Marines is cornered on a cliff, when the Big Bazooka units fire at him making him fall off. The Marines find Luffy hanging off the cliff and try to make him fall to his death by stepping on his fingers, but the cliff collapses and Luffy starts running on top of the falling Marines. The Marines who did not fall tries to shoot down Luffy while he runs away.
Zoro and Sanji are arguing which one of them is better. The Marines notice Sogeking and Chopper and shoot the Rocketman but stop firing once they find out that Kokoro, Chimney and Gonbe were hostages (a trick invented to fool the Marines). Nami makes a cloud in the sky and uses Thunderbolt Tempo to take out most of the Marines. Unfortunately, Usopp's Perfect Clima-Tact design has left the power of the Tempo beyond her control, and it ends up firing thunderbolts all over the island. Nami gets launched away by her own attack and whacks Usopp over the head for messing up the weapon a second time. Her attack has backfired so badly even Zoro and Sanji have been hit. So, the Straw Hats (excluding Nico Robin) try to catch up with Luffy. Luffy is still fighting with the Marines, and notices that some Marines are leaving to stop the pirates at the Main Island front gate. Luffy now knows that his crew, Franky Family and Galley-La Company have arrived.
Zoro notices that they are being followed by the Watchdog Unit of the Law and that Marines begin to surround them. Sodom and Gomorrah come barging in with the Galley-La Company and Franky Family. Using his ropes, Paulie helps the Straw Hats get on. Galley-La go and fight the Marines, allowing the Straw Hats to focus on CP9.
Spandam explains how he knew that Robin was coming to Water 7 by Aokiji, who also gave him permission to use the Buster Call. Robin gets punched for asking Spandam why Aokiji gave permission for the Buster call. Robin is reminded of her past by Spandam.","Monkey D.

Episode 269,Robin Betrayed! The Expectations of the World Government!,25-Jun-06,"Nico Robin questions why Spandam was given rights to the Buster Call, which triggers his anger, thus leading to him beating her. CP9 plans to kill the Straw Hats because they violated the original arrangement: that they entered Enies Lobby after leaving Water 7. Back in the fray, Franky's Giant Bulls talk with Chopper. He translates and they notice that Sogeking is not with them anymore. Elsewhere, Blueno appears before Luffy.","Robin questions why Spandam was given rights to the Buster Call, when she is reminded with the Ohara incident. Robin has a brief flashback of the archaeologists. Spandam tells Robin that the Straw Hats are on the island and should have already been captured (but this report was incomplete). Robin says her agreement was to let the Straw Hats go if she is captured. Spandam then tells Rob Lucci to remind Nico Robin of the exact conditions that were offered, which Rob Lucci explains that the terms of the arrangement were that, excluding Nico Robin, the Straw Hat Pirates would be allowed to leave Water 7 safely; Spandam then tells Robin that after allowing the Straw Hats to leave Water 7 safely as promised, they then decided to come to Enies Lobby (which was beyond the scope of the arrangement). The Marines are still trying to capture Luffy, but are getting clobbered. Fukurou tells Blueno that the report said that only 5 people were down, and they noticed the Den Den Mushi receiver is hooked off. Spandam ask what the CP9 wants and Rob Lucci explain they want blood, and they have the right to kill people because they are with the Government. Sodom and Gomorrah come and rampage over the Marines. Luffy gets cornered by the Marines, so to escape he goes on the roof, but the Marines follow him. Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Rocket and barely escapes the Marine's attacks. Sodom tells Chopper how Franky helped them out and now they are loyal followers of the Franky Family. The Straw Hats now notice that Sogeking is not with them. The Galley-La Company are at the Main Gate and still fighting with the Marines, Paulie remembers what the Straw Hats said and will now stop the Marines from interfering. Luffy has finally shaken off the Marines and made it to the courtyard. Blueno makes a door out of thin air and explains this is the first time that some has got past the entrance. Blueno asks Luffy when he will stop fighting and he replies that he won't at all.","Nico Robin, Archaeologists (flashback), Aokiji (flashback), Spandam, Franky, Funkfreed, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Jabra, Kumadori, Monkey D.

Episode 270,Give Robin Back! Luffy vs. Blueno!,2-Jul-06,"For a while, Sogeking talks with Oimo about how he and Kashii came to support the Marines and hears a familiar story. The majority of the episode is a Little Garden flashback. Sodom, the Giant Bull, takes severe damage and urges those riding him, to run before he collapses. Back at the fight between Blueno and Luffy, Luffy throws the first punch to initiate the battle.","Sogeking is too far away for the Straw Hat Pirates to go back for, so he will have to find his own way to return to the group. Sogeking is having doubts about whether or not he should run away. Oimo wakes up crying, Sogeking wants to know why Oimo is crying. Oimo and Kashii were in a pirate crew, but their bosses starting having competitions and would not leave (Little Garden) until they find out which one is better, so the crew returned home without the two bosses. After fifty years had passed, Oimo and Kashii went back to get their two bosses, but the World Government captured them with a lie. They promised them to let their bosses free if they worked for Enies Lobby for one hundred years and that they will be free and return home to Elbaf. Sogeking tells Oimo the true story, that Dorry and Brogy, have been fighting on Little Garden for one hundred years now, and their competition still continues. Both Sodom and Gomorrah are raging through the Marines, but then Sodom gets hit by the cannon in the heart. Sodom collapses and the Marines find no one riding him. The Straw Hats were able to board Gomorrah before Sodom collapsed and continue moving forward.
Luffy wants Robin back and Blueno explains that Luffy is committing quite a criminal offense against the world. Luffy starts the fight where he breaks through Blueno's Tekkai, sees through his Soru and is able to hit him. Luffy expresses how he does not care about the World Government and that he just wants to get Robin back.","Sodom, Gomorrah, Tony Tony Chopper, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Sogeking, Tilestone, Paulie, Oimo, Peepley Lulu, Kashii, Yuki (flashback), Dorry (flashback), Brogy (flashback), Island Eater (flashback), Zambai, Kiev, Schollzo, Yokozuna, Mozu, Kiwi, Tamagon, Kop, Blueno, Monkey D.

Episode 271,Don't Stop! Raise the Signal Fire of a Counterattack!,9-Jul-06,"Kokoro contacts the Straw Hats via Nami's baby Den Den Mushi. The Franky Family decides to lower the courthouse inner bridge so the Straw Hats can go straight to the courthouse and join Luffy. After Gomorrah collapsed, Sogeking arrives with the giants as back up. Shortly after, Gomorrah stands again and tells those riding him to hold on, as he plans to take them to the courthouse. Inside the Tower of Justice, Spandam gives Kaku and Kalifa a Devil Fruit each, which they both decide to consume. Meanwhile, Luffy and Blueno continue fighting on the rooftop of the courthouse.","Chimney and Gonbe are seen observing something through monoculars on top of Rocketman and calling out to Kokoro, who is drinking next to them. On the road towards the courthouse the Franky Family and the Straw Hat Pirates ride on Gomorrah's back through the Marine forces. Zambai orders Gomorrah to get off the central road, where the Marines are ready to ambush them, to avoid getting injured. Sodom is seen lying hurt on the ground behind them. Kokoro contacts the Straw Hats through Nami's baby Den Den Mushi. She tells them an important information she forgot to mention earlier; how to enter the Tower of Justice from the courthouse, which are not connected via an obvious path. The way is to move the levers that exist on the top floor of the two towers that lie on both sides of the courthouse. This action will lower a bridge that connects the two buildings. Kokoro has been aware of this information since she came to fix the system once with Tom, when he was still alive. The Den Den Mushi is passed on to Chimney who tells Nami that she saw Luffy on the rooftop of the courthouse. Before they hang up, Kokoro asks Nami to keep an eye to the Den Den Mushi in case something more comes up. Zambai then sets up a plan to move as fast as possible. The Franky family will split into two groups they will head to the courthouse towers in order to lower the bridge, while the Straw-Hats will head straight to the courthouse rooftop to join with Luffy. Everyone agrees with his plan. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards Gomorrah gets knocked down by Just Eleven Jurymen, allowing the Marines to catch up with them.
Meanwhile, the two gatekeeper giants, Kashii and Oimo, who were previously defeated at the front gate of Enies Lobby from the combined forces of the three Galley-La foremen and the Franky Family, have now recovered and are able to catch up with the Galley-La Company. Both giants, aware of the deceit from the World Government, are now ready to get revenge which is unexpected by the Marine forces on site and the Galley-La foremen. The former seems very glad about the appearance of the giants, while the latter are completely discouraged and expecting their end. However, the tables turn when the giants reveal their purpose and Sogeking appears on Kashii's shoulders. The giants easily knock out several Marines.
The next scene begins with Franky and Robin, who are prisoners in the Tower of Justice. Franky tells Robin how lucky she is to have friends like the Straw-Hats who put so much effort for her rescue and followed her to as dangerous a place as Enies Lobby. He also tries to convince himself that he is not unhappy with the absence of his own friends, whose arrival has not reached him yet. A flashback starts which shows Spandam offering Kaku and Kalifa Devil Fruits with unknown powers. At first, both CP9 members seemed unwilling to consume the Devil fruits. Jabra was terrified at the sudden appearance of the Devil Fruits and ran away from them. He claimed that each Devil Fruit has a devil in it, and if a Devil Fruit user approaches the two devils of the Fruits will start fighting and the user will explode. However, Blueno explains that this is a misconception. The truth is that a person will only explode if they consume two Devil Fruits, as research from Grand Line scientists has revealed. He also showed his contempt at the misinformation a prestigious intelligence agent like Jabra spreads. Jabra accepted the fact, and overcame his fear, getting closer the Devil Fruits. The flashback ends with Spandam greedily thinking about the increased power the CP9 will achieve after his agents consume the Devil Fruits. At the present moment, the CP9 agents are gathered in Lucci's room, with Blueno only missing. Jabra tries to convince Kaku and Kalifa against eating the Devil Fruits. Kumadori and Fukurou interpreted his stance as jealousy towards any CP9 member who might overcome him in power. However, Jabra discards any such claims and explains his arguments, which are the amount of money Kaku, and Kalifa could gain by selling the Devil Fruits, the possible problems they could face from the Devil Fruits's powers and the fruits' bad taste. Both Kaku and Kalifa resolve to eat the Devil Fruits after all. Apart from their bad taste, they are not affected in any other way for the moment. Lucci appears very satisfied that they ate the Devil Fruits and urges them to understand their new powers and use them against the upcoming confrontation with the Straw-Hats, which Blueno has already started.
The fight between Luffy and Blueno continues, where Blueno understands that Luffy is tougher than he initially thought and tries even harder, taking into account the rubber-like nature of Luffy's body. Blueno uses his ability of making doors out of thin air, to immobilize both of Luffy's feet, thus revealing to him his Devil Fruit power. He explains that he ate the Doa Doa no Mi and splits Luffy's face in three parts, making the one which contains the eyes rotate. At that moment, it is revealed to the Straw-Hats that Luffy has begun a fight with one of the CP9 members. With everyone ready to get off from Gomorrah's back and rush towards Luffy, Chopper shouts against it. Gomorrah communicated to him that he is still capable of moving forward. At the same time, the King Bull gets up from being injured and is on the move again.","Chimney, Gonbe, Kokoro, Gomorrah, Zambai, Roronoa Zoro, Kiev, Schollzo, Tony Tony Chopper, Sodom, Nami, Yokozuna, Tamagon, Kop, Mozu, Kiwi, Sanji, Monkey D.

Episode 272,Luffy is in Sight! Gather at the Courthouse Plaza,23-Jul-06,"As Gomorrah recovers, it is revealed by Chopper that he is blinded, he continues to rush ahead. Spandam receives word of their progress right as the Straw Hats reach the gate. Zoro slices right through it and while on the rooftop, Luffy activates ""Gear 2"" for the first time to fight against Blueno.","Gomorrah, despite being hit by the giant iron balls of the Just Eleven Jurymen, gets back up and continues to advance once again. However, one of the attacks hit his head and damaged his retinas, blinding him; the ride gets rough as Gomorrah crashes against buildings. Chopper tells everyone that Gomorrah had made a promise to Sodom, that he would take them to the courtyard. He is also motivated to help the Straw Hats and Franky Family rescue Franky, the man who saved him and Sodom from being eaten by a Sea King and eventually made them part of the Family. Gomorrah continues charging, but a dead-end loom ahead. Zoro and Sanji break through the intervening building and Gomorrah finally collapses, but he has succeeded. Marines sound the alert; the intruders have successfully crossed the Main Island and reached the Courthouse Plaza.
While Spandam is talking to himself, a marine barges in, nearly making Spandam order the Buster Call. Spandam finally finds out that his Den Den Mushi is off the hook, and that there is an emergency on Enies Lobby. Spandam begins bragging to Robin about how weak the Straw Hat Pirates are. He haughtily asks the agent on the other end if the Straw Hats got accidentally killed, but the agent's reply removes any smugness from Spandam's face: There are approximately 60 intruders total (The Straw Hat Pirates are known, but the Franky Family and Galley-La Shipwrights are not). In spite of the massed resistance of the Marines and agents, they have successfully crossed the Main Island and are outside the Courthouse. Oimo and Kashii have defected (due to Sogeking revealing Dorry and Brogy were never captured) and are now crossing the main island as well, leaving another trail of destruction in their wake. Total casualties to this point total not five, but over 2000. Luffy is responsible for over 1,000 of those casualties; worse, they lost track of him after he rocketed himself towards the Courthouse.
Meanwhile, the Franky Family and the remaining Straw Hats contemplate their next course of action when another Juror's ball is hurled at them. But Yokozuna blocks it with his immense strength. Sanji then follows the chain back, locates, and defeats three of the Jurors. Meanwhile, Zoro cuts away part of the Courthouse door, opening a way inside. With enemies quickly approaching, everyone forms up. Remembering what Kokoro told them, the Frankly Family split into three teams. Mozu and Kiwi lead two groups towards the towers while Zambai leads the rest into the Courthouse to back up the Straw Hats.
Spandam begins to panic as the gravity of the ""worst day in the history of Enies Lobby"" dawns on him. He rushes to the front window and looks outside. There, he sees Blueno atop the Courthouse (Luffy is down a hole and not visible) and tries to figure out what is happening. Soon, Luffy re-emerges from the hole, having been momentarily disoriented from getting his face turned into a door. Blueno resumes his attack, but Luffy continues to track him in spite of Soru, dodges a Shigan and manages to deflect a Rankyaku away from him. Luffy then declares that he cannot finish the fight in his current state. Explaining he needed a way to be stronger in order to protect his friends, he reveals a new technique he developed in order to take his abilities ""one step"" higher. He calls it ""Gear 2"".","Gomorrah, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Yokozuna, Zambai, Mozu, Kiwi, Kop, Kiev, Schollzo, Sodom, Tamagon, Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Funkfreed, Spandam, Nico Robin, Franky, Just Eleven Jurymen, Kashii, Oimo, Blueno, Monkey D.

Episode 273,All for the Sake of Protecting My Friends! Gear 2 in Motion!,30-Jul-06,"The Straw Hats enter while Yokozuna and the Franky Family stay behind at the door to defend their backs. The Three-Headed Judge attempts to stop them, but the Franky Family holds him off. Elsewhere, Luffy's Gear 2 is put into action, ultimately defeating Blueno.","The Three-Headed Judge reports in to Spandam informing him that the pirates have now made their way into the Courthouse. The Three-Headed Judge proceeds to inform the pirates that they had entered a place of ""sacred judgement"" and begins a trial. Zambai and the Franky Family tell Zoro and Nami to make their way to the roof where Luffy is already fighting while Yokozuna and them prevent any of the Marines from flanking them. The Marines and the World Government Workers notice that the pirates are completely ignoring the trial, and one of them raises their rifle and points it towards Zoro who uses his Enbima Yonezu Oni Giri attack to clear a path towards the stairs as they start running towards them.
Sanji, who was still outside fighting Marines, comes running in past Zambai yelling for Chopper and Zoro to get out of his way (calling them ""reindeer and idiot swordsman"" respectively), because he is going to be the one to clear the path for Nami, while jumping and kicking at Zoro, who promptly asks Sanji if he wants to fight. The Franky Family are confused by this and cannot believe he is picking a fight with his crew mates in this situation. Sanji tells Nami to follow him, and only him, as he runs up the stairs ahead of everyone, to which Nami reminds Sanji they are there to save Robin. Sanji then remembers this point, only to exclaim how she must already be lonely and crying while waiting for him to save her. It is around this time that Chopper notices that Zoro has gone the wrong way and not taken the stairs, wondering how Zoro could have gone the wrong way when he just gave him directions and was standing right there. Chopper says that he is going to make Zoro medicine for being ""clueless"", to which Nami asks if he can also make some for Sanji, who is seen running fast enough to kick up a dust cloud several levels up now.
As Chopper stops at the top of the stairs to tell Zoro the way (much to his dislike), the Three-Headed Judge jumps from down below angry that he is being ignored. Zoro blocks the initial attack, as the Judge grabs onto the ledge. Just as Zoro is preparing to fight the Judge, the Franky Family grabs onto the Judge's legs and pulls him back down to their level, telling the Straw Hats that they will handle him.
The scene shifts back to the roof of the Courthouse, where Luffy has just released Gear 2 for the first time in his fight against Blueno. Luffy tells Blueno that he is glad that he met them, because now he will be able to protect his friends as he moves through ever increasingly more powerful opponents. Blueno is confused, since losing Robin is directly related to meeting CP9.
Luffy then raises his hand, as if aiming at Blueno, and starts saying ""Gomu Gomu no..."". Blueno asks if he is aiming at him, and says that will only give him more time to dodge Luffy's attack. He tells Luffy to try and hit him, and immediately uses Soru. Almost instantly, using a previously unseen attack, Luffy yells ""Jet Pistol"", which sends Blueno flying and slamming into the wall behind him. Blueno quickly gets up, unsure of what just happened, looking back toward where Luffy was standing, only to see that he was no longer there. From off camera, another Jet Pistol hits him directly in the right side of the face (Luffy does not call out the name of the attack this time), sending him flying the other direction. Luffy is then seen moving toward Blueno, so fast that he seems to disappear, and transitioning into a Jet Rifle, which sends Blueno flying again. He's moving and attacking so quickly that Luffy forgoes ""Gomu Gomu no Jet"" before calling out each successive attack: a shortcut he only used once before when fighting Arlong: and then only for a two-shot combo. While Blueno is still in the air, Luffy appears directly above him and uses his fist to pummel Blueno into the rooftop, and then immediately back-flips through the air and lands back on his feet several meters away. Blueno sits up, and looks towards where Luffy landed, but all that is there is a puff of steam. Blueno looks around frantically, thinking to himself how he cannot see Luffy at all, and is then hit with another shot from Luffy that sends him flying again. Luffy jumps to the top of a flag pole and unleashes a quick barrage of attacks on Blueno, hitting him with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Stomp, Jet Spear, and Jet Missile (by grabbing onto Blueno's horns) before he even has a chance to react.
Blueno makes it to one knee as he looks around, barely able to see Luffy move as he takes another hit. It is then he realizes that Luffy has mastered the Rokushiki technique Soru. Blueno uses his Doa Doa no Mi powers to create a door in mid-air and jump through it into an alternate dimension. He ponders how Luffy could have possibly learned and mastered a Rokushiki technique, ultimately deciding that Luffy's skills cannot possibly match up to a true Rokushiki user's prowess. Blueno opens the Air Door again, jumping at Luffy who easily avoids the attack. Luffy explains that he is glad he learned something like Soru was possible (by kicking the ground over ten times in an instant; his accurate description confirms Blueno's suspicious of him mastering the technique) and that now he will not lose anymore friends because he is not strong enough. Luffy stretches his arms back as Blueno says to bring it on and that he will stop Luffy's attack with his strongest Tekkai, ""Go"" (Strong). Luffy then hits him with a full-power Jet Bazooka, which sends Blueno sliding back on his heels with a huge dent in his chest, but he remains standing. Luffy comes out of Gear 2, and tells Blueno that he really is a tough guy, but that he has something even more interesting to show him. As Luffy raises his hand to his mouth to begin a new assault, he noticed Blueno is not moving. Blueno then falls to the ground, ending the fight.
Luffy is exhausted after the fight, talking to himself about how his body still cannot quite take Gear 2. But his body is the least of his worries right now; he needs to keep advancing.
Meanwhile the rest of the crew and Franky Family are still fighting through the Marines and World Government Workers. Sogeking is shown still riding Kashii and Oimo with the rest of Galley-La Company. The Marines cannot believe that Yokozuna is preventing them from entering the Courthouse, while Kiwi and Mozu are shown still climbing the towers trying to lower the drawbridge. Spandam tells the workers to gather all the CP9 members together, as the episode ends with Luffy yelling out Robin's name.","Baskerville, Spandam, Roronoa Zoro, Tony Tony Chopper, Zambai, Tamagon, Kiev, Yokozuna, Nami, Schollzo, Kop, Sanji, Blueno, Monkey D.

Episode 274,"Answer Us, Robin! The Outcries of the Straw Hat Crew!!",6-Aug-06,"Franky helped Robin escape from their chains and they made it outside to see Luffy. Luffy wants to come over to rescue Robin but she tells him to stay, that she only wanted to die. Below, as Yokozuna fell, the giants came to cover. All the Straw Hats arrived on the roof, and asked Robin to return.","Spandam gets an update from the Marines. They've managed to locate Luffy atop the Courthouse. This confuses Spandam since he knows Blueno was up there, too. He looks out his window again and sees Luffy recuperating by eating the meat he'd kept in his pockets. Then he sees Blueno motionless nearby. Spandam can only make one sickening conclusion from this. Luffy had defeated Blueno, a member of CP9, one of the most merciless organizations in the World Government. Such a feat should be unthinkable, but Luffy's defiant call for Nico Robin leaves no doubt who won that fight. He immediately calls for Rob Lucci and the rest of CP9. He also orders Baskerville to guard the drawbridge to the Tower of Justice at all costs. Franky doesn't understand why Robin refuses to be saved even after Spandam broke his promise. Franky begins to suspect Robin is running away from something else. While Luffy yelled in the background, Franky decided to make Robin face him. Spandam returns, ordering the Robin and Franky be taken to the Gates of Justice immediately. But he's shocked to discover Frankly has used the rest of his cola power to inflate his rear in what he claims to be a self-destruct mode. Everyone runs for cover, and Franky uses the commotion to release the pressure in his Coup de Boo: a giant flatus that blasts himself and Robin outside, onto the balcony, and into Luffy's sight, breaking his chains in the process. Thankfully, the guard fence keeps them from flying into the abyss outside the tower. Luffy wanted to slingshot himself over the waterfall to rescue Robin, but she told him to stay and that she only wanted to die. The rest of CP9 then joins Spandam to retake Robin and Franky.
In front of the courthouse, Yokozuna keeps a brave stand but now faces the jurors. Jurors are also blocking the way for Mozu's and Kiwi's teams and the rest of the Straw Hats. Zambai is surprised there's an actual courthouse instead of just an empty hall. Baskerville reveals the truth is somewhere in between. He does hold a trial, but the Jurors are all pirates condemned to death; therefore, their only pleasure left is to take as many other pirates with them, so the only thing they say is, ""Guilty!"". The fighting is getting rough; even Yokozuna goes down from a continual assault from the Jurors' giant iron balls. Meanwhile, the Marines regroup behind bulletproof shields and are about to charge into the courthouse. But they are then stopped by Oimo and Kashii, who still have a beef with the Marines who made them waste 50 years by lying to them. Zoro, lost as usual, decides to take a shortcut by blasting the ceiling with Tatsu Maki. This takes out the Juror blocking Nami and Chopper but catches them, too. As Luffy and CP9 stare at each other across the abyss, Luffy declares that they will rescue Robin anyway. Only after she's safe can she decide her own fate. The rest of the Straw Hats eventually join Luffy on the roof (Nami and Chopper blown through the ceiling, Zoro climbing up after them, Sanji kicking his own hole, and finally Sogeking being thrown up by Kashii). Once again, Luffy declares that if Robin wants to leave or die, she can only do so once she's back by their side.
The Straw Hats gather together, each standing atop one of the battlements of the courthouse. Across the falls is the Tower of Justice: their goal and their enemy staring back at them.

Her aunt, with whom she lives while her mother is away doing research, treats her poorly. Other children ostracize her. Studying in the world's greatest library, the Tree of Omniscience, in the hopes of being allowed to help the local archeologists in their forbidden research, Robin earns the rank of a scholar in archaeology at age eight. However, when she announces her intention to help, her request is denied because of her youth. Disappointed at being rejected again, she walks along the shore, where she stumbles on Jaguar D.

Olvia returns to Ohara to warn the other scholars that the World Government's forces are headed there. She decides not to reveal herself to Robin, not wanting her daughter to be branded a criminal because of her. CP9 arrives on the island, capturing Olvia and rounding up the scholars.","A woman walks through the streets of Ohara, listening to the rumors that a Marine ship has appeared at its docks. The scholars at the Tree of Knowledge are informed about this.
Meanwhile, Robin continues to talk to Saul about her hopes of meeting her mother, becoming an archaeologist and studying the Void Century, a century in history whose study is forbidden by the World Government. She tells Saul that her mother was studying the Poneglyphs. Saul was shocked to hear that Robin was the daughter of Nico Olvia, an archaeologist who left the island to study the Poneglyphs.
Saul warns Robin that the Marines were there to eliminate the island's scholars. Meanwhile, the woman from before has arrived at the Tree of Knowledge and is revealed to be Olvia, and she explains that she arrived on the Marine ship. She tells the scholars that the group of people who left the island to search for Poneglyphs were killed by the World Government, leaving her the sole survivor. She warns that the World Government plans to exterminate all of the scholars of Ohara. She tells them to evacuate the island immediately, but the scholars refuse to leave, as fleeing the island would mean abandoning the priceless recorded history.
Olvia decides to cut ties with Robin to prevent Robin from being known as the daughter of a criminal. She takes a gun and leaves. Meanwhile, a World Government ship arrives at Ohara and storms the Tree of Knowledge, targeting all scholars who have tried to study the Poneglyphs. Those who were not archaeologists were ordered to evacuate the island.
Spandine, who was also on the island, was shot in the sleeve by Olvia. Spandine explains that he intended to storm Ohara to warn the academic community to refrain from studying the Void Century. Olvia is struck down. Meanwhile, the World Government agents storm the Tree of Knowledge and round up the scholars, including Robin.

Robin recognizes Olvia as her mother, but Olvia denies it, causing Robin to admit that she is an archaeologist and can read the Poneglyphs. The Buster Call commences, and, after a tearful reunion with her daughter, Olvia entrusts Saul with Robin's care.","Professor Clover is allowed to speak with one of the Five Elders and does a report of their research. He describes a civilization that existed hundreds of years ago and vanished at the time that the World Government assumed power. He considers the collective evidence, which leads him to believe that the government tried to erase their former enemies from history. After stating that Ohara has learned too much, the Five Elders orders Spandine to kill the professor and to give the order to destroy the island.

She also fears that the Straw Hats will also betray her like the others did. After Spandam points out that taking in Robin means making the entire world their enemy, Luffy tells Sogeking to shoot the World Government flag. Sogeking uses his Fire Bird Star to burn the flag, declaring war on the World Government for Robin's sake, much to the shock of those present. Robin, moved by the depth of Luffy's action, cries out that she wants to live and wants to return to the sea with the Straw Hats. The rest of the Straw Hats then prepare to do battle with CP9 and save Robin.","Saul fights the battleships, attempting to allow Robin to escape. She tries to board the evacuation ship, but per Spandine's orders, she is denied access. Vice-Admiral Kuzan, later known as Admiral Aokiji, enters the scene to engage in battle with Saul. While they fight, the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical Vice-Admiral Sakazuki, later known as Admiral Akainu. Saul, on the verge of dying, instructs Robin to flee on his raft. Persuaded by Saul's argument and Sakazuki's action, Kuzan helps Robin escape. From then on, Robin lives a life on the run, not being able to trust even the kindest of people, in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin. In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy. Finally knowing what kept her away, Sogeking, on Luffy's order, burns the Government's flag, declaring war against the World Government itself. Spandam, the Marines, and the World Government soldiers are absolutely shocked. Spandam howls at the Straw Hats that they cannot expect to live with the entire world as their enemy, but Luffy angrily bellows if he wants to bet on it. Robin begins crying after seeing her friends stay by her side. Luffy screams at Robin to say she wants to live, and the others encourage her. Robin remembers the words Saul told her- that she would find true friends who would never leave her, no matter what. Although she also thinks back to all the terrible things once said to her, she also remembers what Usopp told her: believe in Luffy. Breaking down in very heavy tears, she realizes the world had denied her a reason to live. Until now, she was never allowed to declare her own wish. She finally wails out that she wants to live, and for Luffy to take her out to sea with the crew. Luffy beams with a triumphant smile, while Franky sobs from being touched by what he has just seen.

Meanwhile, Nami thinks of how Robin's lonely days are now over, which reminds her of how she joined the Straw Hats herself. In the flashback, Nami tells Luffy not to get involved with what is happening in her hometown and then goes to her house, where Nojiko observes the mess that Nami has caused in a fit of anger. Nojiko asks Nami if the Straw Hats are upsetting her, and Nami explains that she was hoping to be able to leave them behind but that she might have remained with them forever if things had happened differently. Nojiko understands how much Nami cares about the others. Nami's memory of how she joined Arlong's pirate crew, in order to gain enough money to buy her village, is shown. Nami later confronts Arlong, furious about how he allowed the Marines he had bribed to steal her money. Arlong insists he never broke his promise and encourages her to just start saving up anew. He tells Nami that if she flees instead, he will kill everyone in Cocoyasi village. The villagers, led by Gen, hear about this and decide to fight back against Arlong for not keeping his word and being so cruel to Nami. Just as they are ready to go, Nami tries to stop them to keep them out of danger, telling them that she will make a new attempt to buy them free. However, Gen hugs her and says that it is hopeless and that she has done more than enough, finally convincing Nami to let them go. As the villagers set off to Arlong Park, Nami starts stabbing her tattoo until Luffy shows up and stops her. At first, Nami became upset with him for meddling, insisting that it is none of his business, which Luffy is well aware of. But at last, she asks him to help her, crying. Luffy places his straw hat on Nami's head and agrees to do so, and he tells Zoro, Sanji and Usopp to come along, which they do. Luffy breaks into Arlong Park and meets Arlong. They are next seen in Nami's cartography room, where she had been held prisoner for years. For this reason, Luffy starts destroying the room, while fighting Arlong. The whole building is smashed from the attacks. The crowd stares at the scene, wondering who won. Luffy eventually rises from the rubble and tells Nami that she is his friend. Nami starts crying and the scene returns to present time. At Enies Lobby, Nami is reminded of how she has to fight for Robin just like the others did for her before. Speaking on a Den Den Mushi, Kokoro encourages the Straw Hats to get moving, and Luffy stretches his arms to take his friends with him as he jumps down from the building.","Monkey D.

Episode 284,The Blueprints Aren't Passed! Franky's Decision,5-Nov-06,"After Robin decides she wants to live, the Straw Hat Pirates wait for the bridge, so they can battle CP9. Franky reveals that the Pluton blueprints are with him and burns them in front of Spandam, saying that he's betting it all on the Straw Hats. With unexpected help from Kokoro, Franky and the Straw Hats make a dramatic entrance into the Tower of Justice.","We rewind to the point just after Robin tearfully declares she wants to live. Back at the Courthouse, Mozu and Kiwi finally make it to the drawbridge levers atop the towers and throw them. The Straw Hats feel the rumble and realize the drawbridge to the Tower of Justice is lowering. Soon the gap will be closed, and the Straw Hats can advance. CP9 stands defiant, ready for the challenge. Back at the Courthouse, Baskerville declares he will stop the drawbridge. Zambai and Paulie attempt to counterattack, but a shocking fact is revealed. Baskerville isn't one Three-Headed Judge but three judges in a single costume. Because of this, the attacks miss, and Center Baskerville is able to order a trench mortar fired on the drawbridge, jamming it partway. Without a clear path, Spandam can still escape to the Gates of Justice.
But then, Franky decides to make a play of his own. He reveals something Spandam had been seeking for a long time: the plans to Pluton. Spandam and CP9 suddenly realize they'd been tricked. Franky had been concealing the plans within his cyborg body the whole time. Spandam demands Franky hand them over, but instead Franky talks to Nico Robin, admitting that he'd misjudged her based on the rumors of her past. The one thing he and the rest of Water 7 had feared the most was the forbidden knowledge she kept in her head. That and the plans in his hand are the only means by which to reconstruct a weapon of mass destruction. The only reason Water 7 had been keeping the plans was in case she or someone tapped into her knowledge and built a Pluton; then it would take another Pluton to counter it. For years, the shipwrights feared Robin because she was a wildcard: a lonely, shunned individual who could be exploited to tragic end. But now, for the first time, Robin is not alone. The Straw Hats stand with her and have already declared their intention to defend her to the end. Knowing this, and knowing the peculiar situation he's in, Franky decides to make a bet. Silently praying that Tom would've understood what he is about to do, he holds the Pluton plans before him...and burns them to ashes in a blast of Fresh Fire. Spandam and CP9 are shocked again as Franky ruins their five-year espionage mission in a stroke. With the World Government actively seeking them, the plans were no longer of value as a countermeasure, so Franky denied them the prize to prevent them being turned against the wishes of the shipwrights. With the plans destroyed, there's only one way left to build Pluton: Robin's knowledge. His bet is that the Straw Hats will rescue Robin: in doing so denying the World Government their last chance to gain access to the weapon. Franky is now siding with the Straw Hats to help ensure this. Suddenly, Franky hears familiar voices from the Courthouse. It's Zambai and the Franky Family, cheering him on. Franky realizes he, too, is not alone. Finally driven to the point of rage, Spandam attacks Franky, sending him over the broken balcony and into the abyss...
At that moment, Kokoro's voice sounds from Nami's Den Den Mushi. She has Rocketman running again, and it's making its way to the Courthouse. Kokoro tells the Straw Hats to get ready to jump into the abyss. The Straw Hats are confused at first, but once they hear Rocketman's whistle, Luffy realizes what's happening. He stretches his arms to envelop the others and takes the leap off the Courthouse roof. As the Straw Hats and Franky fall, Rocketman appears at the drawbridge and speeds upward at full tilt, flying off the end and into the air. Luffy steers himself and the rest of the Straw Hats to land atop the midair Rocketman, and the train manages to catch Franky on its dented nose. Rocketman continues its flight, and Spandam (to his horror) and CP9 (to their delight) realize it's going to make it. Kokoro contemplates a sense of déjà vu. Many years ago, Tom's Workers built a ship for a certain audacious pirate by the name of Gold Roger. And today, here are Tom's Workers helping another audacious pirate in Luffy.","Kashii, Oimo, Just Eleven Jurymen (K.O.), Mozu, Peepley Lulu, Tilestone, Kiwi, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Sogeking, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 285,Retrieve the 5 Keys! The Straw Hat Crew vs. CP9,12-Nov-06,"The Straw Hats and Franky make it to the Tower of Justice. However, Fukurou reveals that one of the CP9 members has the key to Robin's handcuffs, but will not say which, so the Straw Hats must fight every member to find the key. Meanwhile, Chimney follows Spandam, Rob Lucci, and Robin down a secret corridor.","Rocketman crashes into the front wall of the Tower of Justice. Spandam orders Rob Lucci to accompany him and Robin to the Gates of Justice, and tells the rest of CP9 to destroy the Straw Hat Pirates. He summons Funkfreed, and the elephant morphs into a sword. He tells Robin that the sword was imbued with the power of the Zou Zou no Mi Devil Fruit.
Franky makes it to the remains of Rocketman and pulls out Kokoro, Chimney and Gonbe. Although he frets over them a moment, they awaken with only nosebleeds for injuries. Luffy then jumps out of the rubble, and orders the rest of his crew to do the same. Sanji remarks that, while Luffy may be a rubber man, the rest of the crew couldn't possibly be okay after an entrance like that. Then he, Chopper, Sogeking, Zoro, and Nami pop out of the ruins as if nothing happened. Franky says the entire crew is weird.
The crew prepare to begin the battle, but are stopped by Fukurou. He says Robin is already on her way to the Gates of Justice, and CP9 have been ordered to stop them. He reveals that each of the present CP9 members has a key to Seastone handcuffs. One of the keys will open Robin's handcuffs, but he won't say who has the correct key. Nami explains the effect of Seastone on Devil Fruit users to Franky, and Chopper notes that's why Robin wasn't fighting back.
Luffy tries to hit Fukurou, but he uses Soru to dodge, then escapes with Geppo. Before he departs, Fukurou says the Straw Hats will have to fight CP9 for the keys, or they will throw the keys into the ocean. Zoro and Sogeking hold back an eager Luffy while Sanji figures out a battle plan. He allows Luffy to go ahead and catch up with Robin. The remaining six will take the other members of CP9 at the Tower of Justice. Chimney and Gonbe run off, and explore a secret passageway. Although briefly frightened by bats, they hear Spandam in the distance. As he gloats about the Straw Hats not even knowing how to get to the Gates of Justice, the child and rabbit decide to shadow him. Luffy is shown running a maze of staircases before Spandam is shown at a mechanical gate to an underwater passage toward the Gates of Justice.
Franky looks for a kitchen, hoping to recharge on cola before he begins the fight. He reaches the kitchen, but is intercepted by Fukurou. In a dungeon-like hallway, Nami is met by Kumadori, but initially all he does is stomp his staff on the ground in a kabuki display. Sogeking checks the rooms of another hallway, and finds Jabra asleep in a garden room, with key #1 luckily out in the open. Sanji enters a bathhouse room, and is closed in by Kalifa. She offers him tea, and he is quickly smitten by her beauty.
The episode ends with Zoro finding Kaku in the library. Kaku notes Zoro has already drawn his swords.

Episode 286,Power of the Devil Fruit! Kaku and Jabra Transform,19-Nov-06,"Zoro begins his intense battle with Kaku, while Sogeking fails to retrieve the key from a sleeping Jabra. Kaku reveals his Devil Fruit power and causes the floor to collapse in the process. Meanwhile, Luffy searches high and low in the Tower of Justice, and attempts to cross the whirlpools to the Bridge of Hesitation.","The initial confrontations between the Straw Hat Pirates and CP9 continue to develop. Kumadori continues his kabuki showboating before Nami. Deciding she is at a disadvantage, Nami simply asks for the key. Although he offers to show it, he seems to have misplaced it, to Nami's irritation. In the bathhouse room, Sanji opines that the water Kalifa is using to make tea for them isn't warm enough, and offers his expertise as a chef to make it properly.
Meanwhile, Luffy finally makes it to the point where CP9 was located at their initial confrontation. Naturally, they're not there. He now has to figure out how to get to the Gates of Justice.
Back at the library, Zoro believes Kaku is the one that actually has the key to Robin's handcuffs. Kaku responds he can feel the beastly difference in Zoro's power since their first battle at Galley-La Company headquarters. While Zoro is fearsome, Kaku says he is CP9's best swordsman, and should not be taken lightly. Zoro initially believes him to be of a two-sword style, until Kaku uses Rankyaku slashes from his legs. Kaku states that Rankyaku enables him to use Four Sword Style. Zoro remembers that his training makes Kaku's entire body a weapon.
The first sword exchange between Zoro and Kaku commences, and they clash swords repeatedly. Their first exchange of sword attacks evenly matches Niitoryuu 72-Pound Cannon against Rankyaku Hakurai. Kaku tries to use Soru to get the jump on Zoro, but is defended. A quick retaliatory slash from Zoro barely nicks Kaku's jacket, illiciting a chuckle from him. Zoro says he has no time for jokes. Kaku responds by planting his swords in the ceiling and using Rankyaku Ran to rain a multitude of slashes down at Zoro. After Zoro successfully defends that attack, Kaku decides to unveil his Devil Fruit power, and begins to transform.
In the garden room, Sogeking tries to tiptoe toward Jabra, hoping to take advantage of him sleeping to get key #1 before he notices. But the room seems to be aligning against him. First, his nose is stung by a bee. Then, he feels like his heart stops. Finally, he is confronted by a chicken. But instead of crowing, it chirps, illiciting a facefault from the sniper. Jabra wakes up, and punches Sogeking across the room. He recalls his adversary shooting down the World Government flag, complimenting his shooting ability. He then transforms, revealing he ate the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Wolf, becoming a wolfman. He offers to end the fight quickly by tearing out Sogeking's throat, but the sniper swallows his fear and prepares to fight.
They are interrupted when the ceiling collapses above them. Down falls Zoro along with a large giraffe. Kaku, trying to morph into his beastman form, instead became a full giraffe. Jabra laughs at his comrade's new form, as Zoro wonders if Enies Lobby is a zoo. While Jabra and Kaku bicker over the latter's new form, courtesy the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Giraffe, Sogeking hides, determining that Zoro might be able to take them both. Looking around, he finds some unused pairs of seastone handcuffs.
Kaku gives his transformation another try, and finds his giraffeman form. This startles Zoro, who says Kaku looks funny. Jabra can't stop laughing, even though he tries. The scene is briefly paused when Sogeking tries to throw a pair of seastone handcuffs at one of the beastmen, but gets it on one of Zoro's wrists instead. He says he was distracted by Kaku's beastman form. Fed up with the mockery, Kaku spins on an arm, then uses a Rankyaku slash from his neck, which shoots all around, an attack he calls Amanedachi. Those present are barely able to dodge.
The attack cuts the Tower of Justice in half, with the top half of the tower sliding off-kilter, exposing the garden room to the sky. Kaku grins at his handiwork, having shut the naysayers up.","Kumadori, Nami, Sanji, Kalifa, Monkey D.

Episode 288,Fukurou's Miscalculation! My Cola is the Water of Life,3-Dec-06,"Nami becomes Kalifa's opponent, Kumadori goes after Chopper, and Luffy unleashes a new power! Meanwhile, Franky spars with Fukurou in an attempt to get to the kitchen to power up with Cola.","Nami begins to run up the stairs to face Kalifa, when Kumadori stomps in wanting to continue his fight with her. Chopper tells Nami to continue while he faces him. He then transforms into Arm point and attacks Kumadori, telling him that he will be his opponent.
Meanwhile, Chimney and Gonbe save Luffy from drowning, and pump out all the water he took in. Once revived, Luffy goes back to his pursuit of Robin. Not thinking things through, he begins to stretch his arms and grab a hold of a nearby cannon, preparing to launch off of it in hopes that he will fly across the whirlpools. But when Chimney tells him she found another way there, he accidentally falls back into the water again. After being rescued, again, Chimney and Gonbe show him the secret passage they found. She tells him that they were following ""that guy with Lucci"" (Spandam), Lucci, and ""black-haired neechan"" (Robin) to that place. After running down the stairs, they came to a pair of giant steel doors. After seeing that a key is needed to open the doors, Luffy told Chimney and Gonbe to stand back. Luffy uses Gear 3 and breaks down the door with tremendous strength. This is the first time Luffy uses the Gear 3 technique, although only his shadow is seen. After the dust cleared, Chimney and Gonbe looked in awe at the huge hole that the door once stood then were surprised that Luffy had been reduced to a Chibi-like form!
Meanwhile, Spandam had heard a huge crash, and is worried. Lucci calmly says that it must have been the pirates breaking through the doorway. Spandam says that was impossible not only because it was a solid steel door, but also because they did not know how to get to door room. Lucci tells him that a girl and her bunny were following them, and Spandam demands to know why he did not stop or attack them. Lucci simply says he did not receive an order to do so. Furious, Spandam tells him that his first priority above all else is to protect his life and to eliminate anyone who gets in his way. Spandam then orders Lucci to take Robin and hurry to the Gates of Justice before the pirates catch up with him. At that same time, Luffy, running down the pathway, returns back to his normal size and speeds ever closer to Robin.
Meanwhile, Nami had just reached the place in the structure where Kalifa was last seen. Before entering the room, she wonders how Sanji ended up like he did now. Then she heard water running from behind the door. She opens it to find Kalifa undressing, seen as a shadow behind a veil, preparing to take a bath.
The scene switches to Franky, who was facing Fukurou. Fukurou was using Soru so that Franky would not be able to catch up with him. Franky finally catches him and throws Fukurou against a wall and uses his Beans Left technique on him. That, however, drains the little remains of his Cola, so he hurried to the kitchen. However, Fukurou suddenly appears before him, unharmed. Franky calls him a coward for running away like this, which annoyed Fukurou enough to have him use his special punch, Jugon, which he claims is faster and stronger than a normal Shigan move. Franky, although knocked back by the attack, stands firm and removes the skin from his right hand, preparing to use his Strong Hammer attack. Fukurou performs Tekkai, and since Franky was low on cola, the attack did little damage. Fukurou punches him again, and Franky tells Fukurou his punches are flimsy. Fukurou disagrees with him, saying Franky's punch was flimsy. Franky said if that was true, then his punch was a paper-punch. Fukurou then said he was just pants.
Then Franky and Fukurou began beating each other up with punches and throwing clothing-related insults at each other. Their fight crashed through the wall into the kitchen. Franky then notices a huge refrigerator in the room. Just then, Chopper and Kumadori crash into the room. Chopper, now in his Heavy Point form, runs out of time on his Rumble Ball use. Kumadori was about to attack, but then Chopper opened up the refrigerator and locked Kumadori inside. Franky yells at him, saying he has business with that refrigerator, but Chopper, like Luffy, still has not Franky for beating up Usopp. Franky tells him that if he wants to save Robin, then he will have to help him out by tossing him Cola out of the refrigerator, which will power him up.
Fukurou, now getting angrier by the minute, uses his Jugon Ougi (Jugon Secret Attack) to make duplicates of himself and repeatedly punch Franky. Franky tries to fight back but he's simply too weak. Chopper, accepting that Franky is not an enemy, begins looking for cola in the refrigerator. Chopper opens the fridge quickly enough so that Kumadori does not come out and tosses Franky three bottles of liquid, presumably believing them to be cola. Franky places them in his own mini-fridge and adopts the Fresh Franky persona, with onion-shaped hair. He uses his special Veggie-punch on Fukurou, but it does no damage. After being hit with another Jugon attack, Franky throws the bottles back at Chopper, telling him that it was Vegetable juice and he needs to look in the refrigerator for cola.
Chopper opens the fridge again and tosses Franky three more bottles. This time, Franky's hair turns wavy and he sits back and talks calmly, adopting a farmer persona. He says working on the fields have been hard work and that they should stop the fighting and simply have some tea. Franky then snaps out of it and again throws the bottles of tea at Chopper, who was thoroughly entertained by Franky's persona. Franky says he has no other personalities and says he will only take Cola. Chopper then tosses him 3 more bottles, which are definitely Cola. Franky jumps to get them, but Fukurou, trying to prevent him from using the cola to power up, uses his Rankyaku technique on him. Franky is knocked to the ground, but after the smoke clears it is seen that Franky had placed the bottles of cola inside him and has powered up!
Franky then walks slowly toward Fukurou, with his fists up, telling him to get ready. Fukurou laughs it off, assuming the next punch will be just as weak. Franky uses his Strong Hammer move, which knocks Fukurou through three walls and outside, against the outermost rail of Enies Lobby. Fukurou is unable to move and appears to be knocked out. Franky then says that Fukurou was right, the punches he had been delivering were weak.","Kalifa, Nami, Kumadori, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 289,Zoro's New Technique Explodes! The Katana's Name is Sogeking?,10-Dec-06,Zoro has to fight with Sogeking stuck in his right hand holding a katana against Kaku and Jabra. Franky defeats Fukurou.,"Now recharged, Franky launches Fukurou through a wall, with a Strong Hammer punch, amazing Chopper. However, the zipper-mouth agent is not down yet, giving rise to Franky using his Franky Destroyer Cannons. Escaping, Fukurou uses Soru, and tries to ambush Franky, only for Chopper to reveal his location.
Angered, Fukurou forces himself and Franky out into the ocean, leaving Chopper unable to help out, due to his Devil Fruit side effects. However, Chopper ends up having more important things to deal with, as Kumadori releases himself from the fridge.
Franky and Fukurou each try to send the other into the waterfall, resulting finally in Franky using Strong Right to secure himself to Fukurou, and take him down with him. Desperate to save himself, Fukurou uses Geppou, but Franky holds on, making the condition that the fight can continue on shore, as long as Fukurou uses Geppou to get them both to safety. After a boastful spar of words, both say that they have a move that will finish things off once and for all.
As Sogeking and Zoro still try to escape Jabra and Kaku, Sogeking tries to use the CP9 agents' rivalry against them, by invoking arguments between them, trying to make them fight over who's better. Zoro, however, spoils this, by saying exactly what Sogeking must be planning. Zoro then suggests that to get free, they play Janken, the stakes being that the loser has their hand chopped off, to which Sogeking greatly opposes. Finally, Zoro thinks up another plan, and decides to fight with Sogeking in his right hand against Kaku and Jabra, with Sogeking holding the katana Zoro cannot use in his trapped hand, in essence using Sogeking as a replacement katana.
As Fukurou continues to take himself and Franky into the air, he decides to finish things quickly by using Tekkai Dama to spin Franky into the Tower of Justice. Franky uses a combination of Franky Centaur and Coup de Vent to keep things stable, and finally uses another, more powerful Coup de Vent to send Fukurou into the ground with full force, winning his fight with a victorious ""SUPER!""","Fukurou, Franky, Tony Tony Chopper, Kumadori, Chimney, Gonbe, Monkey D.

Episode 290,Uncontrollable! Chopper's Forbidden Rumble,17-Dec-06,"Chopper continues his fight with Kumadori, and reveals his Monster Point after taking too many rumble balls. ","After a recap of the previous episode, we see Zoro attempting to fight with Sogeking hanging onto one of his katana. Both Kaku and Jabra are not threatened by this in the least. When Zoro tries to attack them, Sogeking keeps twitching, and Zoro misses with each of his attacks, which results in Sogeking getting beaten. Zoro says they have no other choice besides using Janken to see who has to have their hand cut off and go find Chopper, while Sogeking yells out for Chopper to hurry.
Meanwhile, Chopper and Kumadori are facing each other in the kitchen. Kumadori has just eaten a lot of food and broke out of the refrigerator, and is now very fat. Chopper sighs, commenting that he takes bad care of his body. Kumadori says to him there’s no need to worry, repeatedly, much to the annoyance of Chopper. Kumadori then proceeds to use Seimei Kikan (Life Feedback) to change to weight of his body, first losing much weight (using Shouka, meaning digest) then gaining some weight (using Kyushu, meaning 'absorb'), returning to his normal weight size using Moto Douri. Chopper is simply amazed by this, and asks if he could do it again. He does so, going back to fat, then through the process again. Chopper, even more amazed, asks him to do it again. He does it once more, but is a bit exhausted afterward.
Chopper wants to know how he did it. Kumadori gladly explains that after 1,000 years of training at sea and on mountains, breathing the wind and drinking the pure water, he passed the training of Sennin (Master). Enduring it all gave him the ability of Seimei Kikan. He then goes on to say that all humans, from the hair on their heads to the bottom of their toes, can concentrate their sense and stretch them to their limit, having complete control over their body. Chopper claims he read something about this in a book once, and also adds that this would be the reason why his hair acts like an octopus. Kumadori, deeply offended, shouts at him, telling Chopper to call him a lion.
Kumadori then proceeds to attack Chopper with Seimei Kikan Kamishibari (Life Feedback Hair Strangle), and then his hair moves erratically, attempting to grab Chopper. After a while of chasing, Kumadori uses Soru (to shave) to move above Chopper and attacks him with Shigan Cue (Cue Finger Gun), using his staff instead of his finger. Luckily, Chopper moves out of the way in time, but is surprised, as the staff wasn’t even sharp. Chopper tries to fight back with his Heavy Point form, but Kumadori uses Tekkai (iron mass) to nullify the attack. Chopper realizes he can’t defeat Kumadori unless he uses his other forms. But, since his Rumble Ball limit is six hours, and he already took a Rumble Ball, taking one now would do severe damage to his body. Also, after taking a second Rumble Ball, the transformations get messed up and out of control; and after taking a third one, he loses consciousness and fighting would be out of the question.
Then, Kumadori lights the end of his staff on fire, and attacks with Shishi Kebab. Throwing his staff around, he quickly lights the entire kitchen on fire. Chopper, seeing no other opinion, uses the Rumble Ball, thinking the risks are high, but there’s still a chance.
Chopper then turns around at attempts to attack with Horn Point, but changes into Guard Point instead. Kumadori knocks him away with his flaming staff. After bouncing around for a moment, Chopper tries to transform into Jumping Point, but changes into Heavy Point instead. Kumadori knocks Chopper all the way back through a wall. Chopper, while lying on the ground, realizes he can’t control the transformations, but if he can just get Arm Point to come out, he could hit Kumadori with his ultimate attack. The room is on fire (Kumadori had just blow out the fire that was on his staff), and Chopper can’t afford to waste any more time on a guy that doesn’t even have a key. He had to find the number 2 key, so he can unlock Zoro and Sogeking’s handcuffs, and free them. Then he remembers, he’s here to fight for his friends, to rescue Robin. Kumadori then uses Seimei Kikan to turn his hair into many pointing hands. Chopper, not backing down, charges right at Kumadori as Kumadori attacks with Shishi Shigan (Lion Finger Gun), and proceeds to beat up Chopper.
Chopper, now full of small holes from Kumadori's Shigan attack, falls over, while Kumadori says he will not show mercy, as a lion would not permit it. Chopper's body hurts, not just from the attack, but also from the effects of the Rumble Ball. Since he has seven transformations, the odds of turning into Arm Point are one out of seven. If he can just get it, he can hit Kumadori with his strongest attack, hopefully ending the battle. With that notion, Chopper charges in, trying to change into Arm Point, but each time he fails (first time changing to Brain Point, then to Walk Point, then to Jumping Point). All this time, Kumadori keeps attacking with Shishi Kebab, hitting him almost every time. Then suddenly, Chopper changes into Arm Point without even realizing it. Without a second to spare, Chopper quickly attacks with Kokutei Roseo Michieri (Carving Hoof Sakura (Cherry Blossom) Snow-Storm). Kumadori uses Tekkai Gou (Strong Iron Mass), but Chopper attacks, breaks through it and does massive damage.
Chopper had no more energy left, and fell down. Kumadori at first falls to his knees, commenting on the beautiful sakura blizzard. But then, he suddenly gets up in a fit of rage, and attacks Chopper with “the lightning of the lion”. After knocking Chopper through a wall, he attacks him with Rankyaku Renge (Storm Leg Lotus Blossom). Just then, Chopper has a flashback of when he was living with Dr. Kureha on Drum Island.
In the flashback, Chopper was resting in bed, while Dr. Kureha asks Chopper what he had done. Chopper couldn’t remember anything, but Dr. Kureha said that wasn’t good enough. She told Chopper he had burned down an entire town (though no one died), and the entire island is in an uproar about what had happened while Chopper was asleep. Now, Dr. Kureha said she doesn’t mind Chopper experimenting, like his father (referring to Dr. Hiriluk), but Chopper had to take careful consideration before carrying one out. She then goes on to tell Chopper that a doctor always has a person’s life in their hands. A small mistake can turn into something you can’t take back. And if he doesn’t have the brain to take in such consideration, then he might as well quit being a doctor right then and there. Chopper, in tears, said he was sorry, and he would never do it again. Dr. Kureha just told him to hurry up and get better.
Back in the present, Chopper is getting more and more beat up by Kumadori. Kumadori then grabs Chopper with his hair then began to take careful aim for the final blow. Just as Kumadori used Yana Gin Jou (Pure Oak Ferment), Chopper changes into his Brain Point form and, because he is desperate to try and save his friends, took a Rumble Ball for a third time. He mentally apologizes to his friends, knowing this will make him lose control over himself.
As he began to transform, a flashback occurs, explaining what had happened to Chopper back then. Chopper says he took three Rumble Balls and lost consciousness. Dr. Kureha says one could call it the rampage of the Devil Fruit, a terrible power that destroys allies, enemies, and also his own body. It was almost as though he was an actual Monster. Chopper slowly morphs into a form much more threatening than any other he has ever demonstrated. Kumadori looks on in complete terror as the reindeer grows into a humongous goliath towering over his flames. His eyes are glowing a bright, primal blue, and there is no sign of Chopper's intellect in control- only the wild wrath of a beast about to begin a terrible rampage. Monster Chopper roars loudly.","Roronoa Zoro, Sogeking, Kaku, Jabra, Kumadori, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin (flashback), Kureha (flashback), Hiriluk (flashback), Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Luffy finally catches up with Spandam, Rob Lucci, and Nico Robin.","Kumadori stands in awe at Chopper in his Monster form. He wasn’t sure what was going on, but he attempted to defeat him in the name of “Kumadori the Lion”. However, none of his attacks affected Chopper. Finally, Chopper smashed Kumadori against the floor with a single swing of his arm.
Meanwhile, Franky had just retrieved the key from Fukurou (who was still unconscious in the hole), only to find that it wasn’t the key needed to unlock Zoro and Sogeking's handcuffs. The key he had was Number 4, and Zoro and Sogeking’s handcuffs were Number 2. He thinks to himself, if the guy he beat has 4, and “that guy” (Kumadori) had 3, then the only person left who has the Number 2 key is “that secretary woman” (Kalifa). He’s ready to go and help.
Meanwhile, Kalifa is taking a bath within her room, while Nami lies on the floor by the door, soaked in soap. Kalifa taunted her, saying she’s free to attack, but Nami could not move. Nami does realize that Kalifa is a Devil Fruit user, and she says that she should lose her power if her body’s at least half-submerged in water. Kalifa isn’t worried, though, since Nami has lost her power as well; she then proceeds to get out of the tub and dry off/dress up. Nami demands to know what her power is, but Kalifa, somewhat, “dared” her to try and figure it out, saying unraveling the mystery is the best part of fighting a Devil Fruit user. Nami remembers what happened to Sanji, how he became all smooth and shiny. Soon, Nami’s power gradually returned, and once her power was back, she attacked Kalifa with Thunder Charged Climate Tact, but Kalifa simply used Soru to move out of the way. However, what Kalifa didn’t realize was that there was a cloud formed above her. Nami then attacked with Thunderbolt Tempo, and lightening struck Kalifa where she stood.
However, when the dust cleared, Nami only saw a large bar of soap with CP9 labeled on it. Kalifa had encased herself within the soap to protect her. Nami, surprised, wonder how she did it, but Kalifa again, egged her on to try to figure it out. Thinking it through, Nami questioned if she was a “soap-woman” who ate the “Awa Awa no Mi” (Bubble Bubble Fruit), or something like that. Caught off guard, Kalifa stuttered as she said that even if she did know her power, she still doesn’t have a chance of winning (she probably wasn’t expecting her to actually figure it out). She then admitted that she was correct; she did eat that fruit, and she has the power to create bubbles (causing Nami to accidentally blurt out that would like to have Kalifa as her secretary, before remembering they are both women). She then proceeded to show off her power by using the bubbles from the bathtub to form Soap Sheep (using her arms as horns). Then she used Hitsuji-Gumo Relax Awa to attack Nami by shooting the bubbles at her. It was at this time Kalifa brought up why Nami lost her power when she entered the room. It was then Nami realized that the floor was covered with bubbles, and that it was the bubbles that caused her to lose her power. One cloud of bubbles hit Nami, clinging to her as she fell to the floor. She began to lose her strength as Kalifa approached her and kicked her towards the wall. However, this caused the bubbles that were attached to Nami to come off, so she used this opportunity to attack with Thunder Ball. However, Kalifa once again used Soru to sneak up behind her.
Once behind Nami, she used Golden Awa (Golden Bubble, “awa” also being a pun on “hour”) and began to rub her legs, producing soap as she did so. This made them smooth and shiny, and caused Nami to collapse. Kalifa explained that she can smooth out anything she touched into a nice shine. Though it frightened Nami, Kalifa acted, though, as if it were a good thing, giving her opponent perfectly smooth skin; she further states that she will not stop until Nami's entirety falls under her power's influence.
Meanwhile, back in the kitchen, Kumadori was badly beaten and bruised, barely able to stand. Chopper did not have a single scratch on him. Chopper raised his arm for another beating. Kumadori used Tekkai, but it was no use. Meanwhile, on the outside, Franky just scaled the wall and reached the level where the kitchen was. There was a huge bang, and Chopper walked up, dragging Kumadori by the head. Franky was shocked to see Chopper like this, and perhaps just as much to see Kumadori beaten so badly. Chopper then tossed Kumadori all the way over to the Courthouse like a rag doll. Franky didn’t even recognize Chopper at first, but then he saw the hat Chopper always wears. When he asked him if he was the same person, Chopper attacked Franky. Meanwhile, over at the Courthouse, many Marines and Government officials were shocked to see that Kumadori had been tossed all the way from the Tower of Justice. Back at the Tower of Justice, Franky lay flat on the ground, wondering what the hell is going on, while Chopper climbs up the side of the tower.
Meanwhile, in a long tunnel leading to the Gates of Justice, Robin hears chopper howls and stops for a moment. Rob Lucci stops and looks back at her, then Spandam, who tells Lucci to drag Robin along. Spandam then tells her that there’s no way “those lousy pirates” can save her. They are almost at the Bridge of Hesitation, which leads directly to the Gates of Justice. Once she’s beyond the gates, the only thing she will feel is the pain of her sins; the sin of living until that day. He then proceeds to laugh in her face and continue onward, until Luffy yells out “ROBIN!” so that the entire tunnel could hear him. Robin looked back, smiling that Luffy has come to rescue her. Lucci gave an evil grin, showing that he’s been waiting for Luffy to arrive. Spandam began to panic, sputtering like crazy until Lucci calmed him down. He told Spandam to take Robin and continue to the Gates of Justice. Luffy, in the meantime, arrived at another door, although this one was wooden, unlike the last one. He easily broke through it, and found none other than Lucci waiting for him on the other side.","Kumadori, Tony Tony Chopper, Franky, Fukurou (K.O.), Kalifa, Nami, Sanji (flashback), Nico Robin, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Spandam, Funkfreed (sword form), Monkey D.

In the tunnel, Spandam gloats to Robin that once they cross the Gates of Justice, Robin's hopes will be dashed. Luffy calls out to Robin forcing Spandam to take Robin the rest of the way. Luffy then confronts Lucci in a storage room.
In the storage room, Lucci admires the Straw Hat captain's skill and Luffy couldn't have done so without his friends.
Meanwhile, Chopper climbs the tower while Zoro is still bound to Usopp at a disadvantage against Kaku and Jabra. In Kalifa's bathroom, Nami's legs have been rendered softened leaving her weak. The CP9 reminds Nami she could make sacrifices to make beauty. However, Nami hopes to turn the fight around. Franky wakes up to give chase to Chopper.
Kashii and Oimo continue to hold the line blaming them for lying to them. In their efforts, Kashii is distracted by cannons and brought down by the Marines. The Galley-La workers soon find themselves surrounded by Marines. On a long staircase, Spandam pulls out a Transponder Snail trying to call in CP9, but Robin sees it's the Golden Transponder Snail, the very same one that obliterated Ohara. Then, the Marines think Aokiji activated the signal and it would take them 30 minutes to arrive.
Spandam reminds Robin that in order to assure she gets handed to the Government, he activated the Buster Call, as he is willing to make sacrifices in the name of justice. Robin tells her captor of what happened in Ohara years ago. With the Pluton blueprints burned, all he has is Robin. Spandam learns his Transponder Snail's still up. He attempts to impersonate Luffy, but Robin issues evacuation orders before Spandam disconnects. Meanwhile, the other CP9 agents Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa and Jabra vouch to finish things up quickly. The Marines and agents begin to evacuate leaving the Galley La workers and Franky Family members behind and tied up.
With time running out, Zoro intends to remember using Usopp as the Nose Storm sword. Luffy and Lucci begin their fight with the agent's head being flung off.

Sanji implores Usopp to leave while he faces off with Jabra. The cook tries to take Jabra's Iron Body Kenpo but is knocked back. Just then, Usopp gets an idea to rescue Robin. Before Jabra can give chase, Sanji kicks the wolf-man in the face. Jabra gets up and tries a Ten Finger Pistol, but the cook dodges and retaliates with a Troisième Hachis barrage.
Sanji then continues to pummel Jabra with a number of kicks but is unable to pierce the Iron Body that the wolf-man has. When Sanji does the Deuxième Hachis, it seems to work at first, but Jabra gets back up and knows that the cook is his worthy opponent. The wolf then appears to surrender his key and explains that Robin is his sister. Sanji is perplexed while Jabra tells his story on the West Blue. It seemed like they were happy on the beach when a pirate crew kidnapped Robin. He learned that Robin had escaped and was being hunted by the law. Before Sanji can take the key, Jabra prepares to take him by surprise, but Sanji knows it was all fabricated, so he will kick him twice as hard.

Then, Jabra decides to do his Wolf Hunt High-Speed Scratch to retake the advantage against Sanji. He then blasts Sanji with the Lupus Fall.
This time, Sanji intends to stand his ground and builds up his rage. Jabra kicks the cook back with the Devil Wolf technique. Sanji then spins around until his right foot sets on fire. This is Diable Jambe which would pierce the Iron Body. Jabra begins to feel intense pain from the Diable Jambe hitting him. Jabra jumps high and does the Moonlight Ten Finger Pistol piercing the cook. But Sanji does one last kick, Flambage Shot sending Jabra falling to the ground.

As he avoids the debris, he notices the sign Nami left before and decides to head after them.
Back with Robin and Spandam, they have unfortunately arrived at the Bridge of Hesitation, and they now see the gates which are now wide open. Spandam soon starts to gloat and mock Robin, telling her that once he passes through the gates he will be known as the world's hero but when she (Robin) passes, it'll be like hell. Robin then headbutts him in an attempt to escape but stumbles and trips before she can get far. Spandam then proceeds to taunt and kick Robin with him calling her stupid over and over again. Spandam tells Robin that she cannot escape and to give up by calling her an obstinate cow. He reminds her that he is the hero of the world, and he is different than her and better than her. Spandam says while he gets a bright future ahead, Robin is condemned to die without a shred of hope. He tells Robin that she is nothing but a steppingstone to her. He asks ""Have I finally gotten that through your thick skull? Or do I need to keep grinding it in for you?"" and then he laughs evilly. Franky is then seen running through the tunnel when he sees a light. We then see the Buster Call with one of the lesser members saying that their time for arrival is 10 minutes. Franky then arrives in the room where Luffy and Lucci are fighting. While Luffy is holding on to Lucci, Franky tells him that he got him, and tells him to hold him there and he will shoot him.

Meanwhile, Kashii and Oimo continue carrying the Galley La workers, the Franky Family, and Sodom and Gomorrah while running away from the Buster Call. They all cheer Luffy and Franky on.
Luffy, still in Gear Second, stands before Lucci, who is still in half-leopard form. The Straw Hat captain shows his determination to defeat Lucci, while Franky races towards Robin.
Spandam has loosened Robin's teeth grip on the bridge and the marines ready themselves to welcome Spandam. The CP9 chief looks on with pride as he had set a landmine to blow up the stairs and anyone trying to climb them. He then continues to drag Robin by rope who tries to tell her captor she's not going through. The CP9 chief assures the entire Straw Hat crew will be vaporized by the Buster Call just like Ohara was. He goes on to tell her that Spandine commanded the mission to Ohara. Spandam also tells of how Robin led a life on the run from the World Government.
Robin assures that Ohara's legacy will not die as long as she lives. Just then, Franky suddenly detonates the mine. Spandam gloats how he is about to go down in history.
When all seems lost for Robin, a projectile suddenly hits Spandam, shocking the scholar. The Marines are perplexed trying to find the shooter. As the Marines are picked off, Robin looks surprised as Usopp as arrived standing on the Tower of Law.
Spandam is then shot himself and Robin makes a run for it. The Marines almost shoot her to stun her when Franky blocked the bullets with his steel body. Usopp then contacts Franky that the keys have been brought to uncuff Robin. It takes a couple of seconds, but Franky frees Robin at last.

With no way back, the two decide to capture the ship Spandam had intended to use to bring Robin to the Marine headquarters. Unfortunately, Vice-Admiral Doberman, one of the respondents to the Buster Call, arrives. His battleship takes a shot at the stockade and blows a hole in it. The next attack by Doberman is shooting at the Tower of Justice, causing its already broken upper half to crush down into the waterfall. Usopp narrowly escapes as it crashes into the abyss below and demolishes the damaged drawbridge with it. Zoro and Sanji realize that because the Gates of Justice are fully open, the waterfalls surrounding the island have vanished because the water current no longer has to go around them. This will allow the battleships to take a clear path into Enies Lobby. The resulting loud noise created reaches Luffy and Rob Lucci beneath the Bridge of Hesitation. Luffy's use of Gear 2 begins to take a toll on him. He pants heavily throughout its activation, and then Gear 2 completely wears off during his fight. Lucci figures out Luffy is doping his blood by using his legs as pumps—a move that would cause a normal person's heart to explode from the excess blood pressure. It is a move only Luffy can use due to the resilience of his unique rubber inner organs, but it risks shortening his lifespan. Luffy does not care about the damage he is doing to his body if CP9 is going to tear apart his life by taking his friends away, and yells at Lucci for making light of his crew's dire situation as if it were a game. Anticipating that the Straw Hats would emerge through the underground passage, Lucci tears a hole into a wall of the underwater chamber, flooding it and the passage. Meanwhile, Nami catches up to Kokoro, the unconscious Chopper, Chimney, and Gonbe in the passageway, with Zoro and Sanji about to do the same, none knowing a torrent of water is headed straight for them. Spandam desperately calls on all the Marines he can find to save his skin and try to stop Robin from escaping, but she and Franky easily defeat the reinforcements.

But, Ninjin is sick and cannot go to the festival. That makes Chopper and Luffy feel really sad. The next day, the greatest sakura tree of the park disappears, and Usopp thinks it was Luffy who stole it, in order to fulfill Ninjin's wish to see the blooming sakura. They later found out it was Foxy and Buggy.","The episode starts with the narrator announcing the Spring has come, and some excited villagers, including Zoro, discussing the upcoming celebration of blooming of the sakura, which takes place once a year. Meanwhile, Chopper and Luffy are seen with Ninjin lying in bed feeling sick, and Chopper concludes he is too sick to move and better rest; Tamanegi and Piiman are disappointed with it, as they all wanted to visit the Hanami together.
All the Straw Hat Pirates are seen in their cafeteria, with Nami, Usopp and Sanji discussing the selling rate increase, and Luffy and Chopper feeling sorry for the fact Ninjin is sick and has to skip the festival. Luffy then states he would just like to find a way to show Ninjin the thousand-year sakura. Then both Luffy and Chopper leave, with Nami noting Luffy did not even finish his meal.
The day of the Hanami festival has finally arrived, and the people who gathered for its celebration note the sakura has been stolen. Usopp then remembers Luffy's words and starts suspecting him to be the thief. He then visits Nami and Sanji's cafeteria and shares his theory with them. This completely enrages Nami, and she orders Usopp and Sanji to find the thief immediately. They then proceed to look for Luffy (during this segment, Wanze is seen in the background showing the peace sign to the audience).
Usopp and Sanji finally find Luffy in Ninjin's house, who's showing him a branch of sakura, which Usopp assumes is an evidence of Luffy's theft. He then starts interrogating Luffy, who denies all the accusations. Meanwhile, Robin spots the sakura tree on a pirate ship and quickly notifies the Straw Hats about it, who rush to the location.
It is then revealed that the theft of the sakura tree is a combined effort by Buggy and Foxy, and that they made an agreement that Buggy would steal the tree for Foxy for 10,000,000. However, Foxy then reveals he lied to Buggy, which prompts the latter to fire a Buggy Ball, only to be slowed down by Foxy's Noro Noro no Mi's ability. Luffy, Sanji and Usopp finally arrive to the ship and confront Buggy, who gets punched by Luffy while affected by the Noro Noro Beam, which confuses the Straw Hats, as they seem to be unaware of Foxy's powers. Foxy then uses the Noro Noro Beam to slow down both Sanji's and Usopp's attacks. Suddenly, Zoro appears, who is revealed to be sleeping all this time on the sakura tree. Foxy then attempts to use the beam on Zoro as well, but he instead parries it with his sword, reflecting it onto Buggy, who had just used the Bara Bara Festival, thus slowing him down. Zoro then punches Foxy, who immediately afterwards sustains Sanji's and Usopp's attacks, which he had previously slowed down. Luffy then delivers the exclamation point, punching Foxy with the Gomu Gomu no Pistol (while holding a sword in his hand), which sends Foxy flying. Sanji then spots Buggy, who is still under the effects of Noro Noro Beam, with Luffy punching away at him with a Gomu Gomu no Gatling Gun (while still holding a sword in his hand), which sends the separate body-parts of Buggy flying as well.
The Straw Hats then retrieve the sakura tree, carrying it on Foxy's ship, so all the villagers, including Ninjin, can witness it, which helps Ninjin recover almost immediately. Chopper starts wondering if the effects of his own medicine have finally taken effect, but then acknowledges that the sight of the sakura tree has cured Ninjin.","Roronoa Zoro, Orika, Tony Tony Chopper, Ninjin, Tamanegi, Piiman, Monkey D.

As Luffy's anger grows, he activates Gear 3, in the battle against Lucci.","We recap to the point the Buster Call shoots the Tower of Justice. It's revealed that Sogeking fell from the struck section and into the base of the tower where Sanji and Zoro were located, avoiding falling with the rest of the section into the abyss. Meanwhile, on the Bridge of Hesitation, Franky and Nico Robin (just freed from her cuffs) prepare to fight their way past Spandam and the Marines to reach a getaway ship. At the same instant, Luffy is still fighting Rob Lucci in the first column. Lucci has just used a Rankyaku to start flooding the column and the underground tunnel with seawater, meaning anyone attempting to catch up to them will drown, enraging Luffy.
Robin sees the arrival of the Buster Call and falls to her knees in shock while Spandam tries to calm the Marines seeking to flee its wrath. The Buster Call begins its attack on Enies Lobby's Main Island. Their main objective is to stop Luffy and company, and they'll destroy Enies Lobby to do it. Franky is stunned at this ""total madness,"" but as he turns he sees Robin clutching herself, frozen in fear. She recalls how the Buster Call was just as merciless in leveling her home of Ohara, and now she is witnessing its terrifying force for a second time.
Sanji, Zoro, Sogeking, Kokoro, Nami, Chimney, and Gonbe make their way through the tunnel in two groups. In the rear, Sanji and Zoro are carrying an injured and slung Sogeking. Ahead, Chimney recounts to Kokoro and Nami how Luffy broke the heavy steel door earlier using a new technique called Gear 3. While effective, the attack apparently resulted in Luffy shrinking into a tiny form for a time. Chimney then hears something ahead; it's the flood of seawater.
Meanwhile, the first column is itself flooding, forcing Luffy and Lucci to take the fight higher up the column and above the water line. Lucci continues to taunt Luffy about the fate of his crew and friends. But Luffy places his faith in them. While the two groups face the onrush of water, Luffy and Lucci resume fighting, and Lucci's Rokushiki mastery forces Luffy to play his trump card. He activates Gear 3 and reveals his Bone Balloon technique. Biting into his thumb, he inflates the bones in his right arm then transfer the air to his left arm, giving it the size (and power) of a giant, which he proceeds to unleash on Lucci: Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol, an attack powerful enough to overwhelm Lucci's Tekkai, blow a massive hole in the first column, and send Lucci flying.","Spandam, Funkfreed (sword form), Franky, Nico Robin, Jaguar D.

Episode 305,The Terrifying Past! Dark Justice and Rob Lucci,15-Apr-07,"After receiving the impact from Luffy's Gigant Pistol, Lucci barely manages to get up, thus continuing his fight with Luffy. We also find out about the sadistic CP9 agent's past thanks to Vice-Admiral Doberman, of how Lucci became the enforcer of his ""dark justice"".","Lucci is nearly unconscious after being hit by Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Giant Pistol, where he reminds himself that he can't afford to fall into the water. He then lands on a ship of the Buster Call, where the Marines are confused and amazed.
On the island, Zoro, Sanji and Sogeting (who is carried by the former) are running through the tunnel seeing that the water is reaching them. But the water appears from the other, where it also chases Nami, Chimney, Chopper and Kokoro. Zoro tries to break through the walls to escape, but the tunnel has been strengthened and cannot be cut and at that moment they are engulfed by water. Meanwhile the island's marines try to escape of the Buster Call in the Sea Train, despite knowing there was no driver.
On a Buster Call ship, where vice admiral Doberman was, he is asked by one of his men what to do with Nico Robin, however he says not to interfere, saying that Rob Lucci would be able to take care of the mission. Meanwhile, on the ship where Rob Lucci was, he manages to get up and transforms back into his human form, where the marines do not recognize him when they see him, so they ask him to identify himself. There a captain present tells them that he was Rob Lucci, for which they apologize to the latter. On the other hand, back with Doberman, he begins to tell his subordinates the story of Rob Lucci.
15 years ago a kingdom was invaded by pirates, where 500 of its soldiers were taken hostage, and the captain demanded to be named the new king of the kingdom.
The desperate king was about to accept the request. However, one of his subjects tells him that a government emissary has arrived. Here appears a 13-year-old Rob Lucci, which angers the king by believing that the World Government was mocking them by sending a child. Lucci approached the king, who asked him to save the soldiers, but the boy told the king not to question the ways of the World Government. This left the king very confused about him, since despite being a child, he was terrified of him.
Later, Lucci entered the pirates' ship and tried to bring justice against them, then everyone laughed and made fun of him and two pirates tried to kill him with their swords; but Lucci blocked it with his Tekkai, leaving the two pirates confused. The captain, astonished, warned him that if he resisted anymore, the hostages would be killed, and then decided that the boy would be his hostage so that the World Government would obey them. After he was locked up along with the other hostages, Lucci made sure that all the hostages were there; Then, using his Rokushiki techniques, he brutally murdered the 500 hostages.
While the pirate crew was still enjoying their party, one of the pirates ran out and yelled at his captain about the hostage problem, and the entire crew watched in horror as Lucci had murdered them. After a brief discussion about the justice of the World Government, the captain angrily ordered his crew to shoot Lucci with cannonballs. The captain said Lucci had it coming for putting them down, then complained about how his perfect plan was ruined. However, he saw, to his surprise and horror, that Lucci had survived the explosion; the latter quickly appeared in front of him and killed him with a Shigan barrage. The rest of the crew seeing this was very horrified and scared, so they quickly fled.
In the present, Luffy goes to the ship where Lucci was, so the marines present try to shoot him, but without success. Luffy then uses Gomu Gomu no Gigant Axe, where he destroys the ship and knocks out many of the marines, but Lucci manages to dodge it and attacks him in his full leopard form, biting him on the shoulder. Luffy then uses Gomu Gomu no Gigant Whip and hits the masts of the ship Lucci was on. Lucci attacks Luffy, jumping behind him and kicking him into the ship and launching a Rankyaku which Luffy dodges and cuts through the deck.
Elsewhere, Spandam taunts Franky, telling her that even though they defeated the other members of CP9, Luffy won't be able to defeat Lucci.
On the ship where vice admiral Onigumo is, he is informed that Rob Lucci and Luffy are fighting on ship number 4; he then orders said ship to be fired upon, knowing that Lucci would survive. One of his subordinates, however, tells him that the ship is full of many of his men, but the vice admiral answers by shooting him, to later tell them about justice.","Monkey D.

Episode 309,Feelings Put Into Fists! Luffy's Full-Power Gatling,13-May-07,"The Straw Hat Pirates continue their fight against the Marines while Usopp reveals himself to Luffy and encourages him to stand once more. Zoro has his Yubashiri destroyed by the Sabi Sabi no Mi user. Lucci traps Luffy using his tail and lands his strongest attack on Luffy. The pirate, having Robin in mind, forces himself to stand back up and manages to defeat his opponent using his most powerful attack, Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling, which sends Lucci through the wall and astounds all the Marines.","The Straw Hat Pirates are still fighting the Marines, while Luffy holds off Lucci, on the Bridge of Hesitation. Franky is shown firing into a crowd of Marines, which prompts one who is wearing boxing gloves to charge him. Franky easily dispatches him with raw power, throwing him back past the group he is fighting. The Marines are shocked at how strong the pirates are and how they are easily beating the captains of the ships they came from.
As Luffy and Lucci continue their fight, Nami and Nico Robin are shown out of breath and surrounded by Marines. One Marine notes that they should be fine as long as they can avoid Nami's lightning attacks. They then look up and realize there is another cloud above them. Robin has a hand come out of each Marine and slaps them. Nami then warns the Marines to be careful during the second thunderstorm, and unleashes another Thunderbolt Tempo on them, frying the whole group. Standing on the ship close by are Kokoro, Chimney and Gonbe who are seen cheering on Robin and Nami. Chopper is face-up on the deck of the ship, exhausted. Nami says they will leave Chopper's care in their hands before Robin and her take off up the stairs towards Roronoa Zoro, Franky, and Usopp. Chopper expresses his sadness over not being able to fight and wishes everyone good luck.
As Usopp watches Luffy battle Lucci, Marines approach him from behind. He turns and fires his Kabuto at them, but they easily dodge while jumping through the air towards him. Just as Usopp is about to be overrun a Rankyaku from Lucci flies up and takes out the three Marines that were about to attack Usopp. Usopp, who had his eyes closed, looks around to see all the Marines laid out, and promptly declares victory by starting to sing the Sogeking Song.
Franky punches Captain Very Good, only to have him split into many smaller balls because he has eaten the Beri Beri no Mi, and begins making the balls hit Franky from every direction. Zoro steps in front of him and knocks all the attacking balls away. Franky then grabs onto Very Good's head and fires a Weapon's Left behind the head that sends it flying and crashing into the side of a battleship. Franky calls out to the Straw Hats to be careful, since some of these Marines have Devil Fruit powers. Nami and Robin arrive at the same location as Franky, Zoro, and Usopp with Marines in hot pursuit. Robin, answering Franky, says that she is also a Devil Fruit user, and turns around to face the Marines. She uses Clutch to bring down the group.
Zoro then looks over to see a Marine standing there wearing a mask. As Zoro goes to land a strike, the Marine catches his sword, which instantly rusts and turns to dust down to the hilt. The Marine tells Zoro that he is a rust-man who ate the Sabi Sabi no Mi, and that Zoro can not defeat him with swords because he will rust them all. Zoro picks up two Marine swords from the ground before charging to attack. He cuts the Marine, but the sword he used only disintegrates after being turned to rust. The Marine says again that Zoro can not defeat him with a sword, and grabs Zoro's arm and rusts his joints. The Marine begins to rust Zoro's entire body when Usopp launches a Fire Bird Star which hits the Marine and takes him out.
Meanwhile, somewhere inside Enies Lobby, a Marine is shown talking on a Den Den Mushi to another Marine somewhere on the island. As the Marine drops the Den Den Mushi receiver and runs away, Sanji shows up and kicks in the door the guard was protecting. A large lever is revealed, as Sanji lights up a cigarette.
Usopp is looking out with a worried face back towards where Luffy and Lucci are fighting. Usopp yells for Luffy to get up, who is on the ground bloodied and out of breath. Luffy manages to turn his head slightly, realizing that it is Usopp standing there and not Sogeking. Usopp then starts taunting Lucci saying that he has eight thousand followers and others lies that Lucci ignores. Usopp then taunts him, which finally grabs Lucci's attention.
As Lucci starts walking towards Usopp, Luffy tells him to leave Usopp alone and to stop. Lucci tells Luffy that he has no more business with him now that he is defeated, and to just watch from there as he kills all of them. Usopp eggs Lucci on again, telling him that he will send Lucci flying. Luffy tells Usopp to stop and asks if he is crazy because Lucci is going to kill him. Usopp then throws this back in Luffy's face, asking what he is going to do about it when Luffy is so close to death. Luffy struggles to get up, but only coughs up more blood and falls back down. Usopp tells Luffy to stop worrying him. Lucci reaches the edge of the destroyed tower, and asks Usopp if he is finished. To protect his friend from the menace of Lucci, Luffy gets up, ready to fight until he has beaten his opponent. The two of them charge at each other, each unleashing a barrage of punches.
Luffy, about to fall backwards to the ground, remembers his promise not to fall until he beats Lucci. He stands up, arms outstretched, and lets out a blood-curdling yell. Lucci, who is bloodied and breathing heavily, turns his head to see Luffy standing there and is shocked. As he glares back at him, Luffy remembers all the times people claimed that Robin would be the Straw Hats' downfall, including comments from Admiral Aokiji and Lucci himself. Luffy lands a Jet Pistol on Lucci. Lucci flies at him, and he tries a couple more Jet Pistol's, but they miss. Lucci tries to use Rokuogan but Luffy moves away. Just then Lucci's tail grabs Luffy, holding him in place. Lucci uses The Largest Ring: Six King Gun point blank, which devastates Luffy. However, Luffy uses Jet Gatling. Lucci, seeing a huge attack coming, barely has time to use Tekkai and Lucci gets pummeled and slams into the wall. Luffy increases the power of the Jet Gatling even further hitting Lucci so much that he is projected through the wall. As the smoke clears over Tower 1, a Marine gets on the Den Den Mushi loud speaker and reports that Rob Lucci was defeated.","Franky, Glove, Nico Robin, Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 310,"A Friend Approaches from the Sea!
The Straw Hat Crew's Strongest Bonds",20-May-07,"Luffy, after finally defeating Rob Lucci, is unable to move after his battle. The Franky Family, along with the Galley-La Company, Yokozuna, Oimo, and Kashii are still alive after their Buster Call encounter. When all hope seems lost, the Straw Hats hear a familiar voice that tells them to jump into the sea; the voice belongs to the Going Merry.","The Marines of the Buster Call are stunned by the announcement of Rob Lucci's defeat. The thought of a pirate able to defeat one believed to be the most powerful, most ruthless Agent of the World Government fills all of them with dread at just what the Straw Hat Pirates are capable of performing. On the other side, the Straw Hats and their ally Franky are all reinvigorated by Luffy's victory, and they begin the push to clear the way for their escape. Suddenly, the Den Den Mushis are filled with voices of congratulations. Usopp suddenly stops and tries to track something with his ears: something familiar. To Franky's joy and relief, the voices are Zambai and the Franky Family along with Paulie and the Dock 1 shipwrights. While they had been surprised by a Buster Call attack and knocked over the edge, Paulie had used his Rope Action to throw up a net. The giants Oimo and Kashii had endured the brunt of the attack, allowing everyone to survive. With the Buster Call focused on the Straw Hats, Zambai assures them they can get away.
Eventually, the Vice-Admirals get the Marines over the shock and the fight resumes on the Bridge of Hesitation. But the Straw Hats and Franky continue their stubborn defense. So, the Buster Call decides to zero in on Luffy: too tired to even move from the spot where he fell in victory. Usopp is the first among the Straw Hats to realize Luffy's problem. First, the Marines destroy the escape ship. Thankfully, Sanji had evacuated Chopper, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe from it before the attack hit. The Straw Hats soon realize the Buster Call is redoubling its efforts and strategically cornering them: even at the expense of their own men. Eventually, they're isolated on the second column: unable to reach Luffy in the first column while the battleships take aim. Just then, Usopp hears that voice again. Soon the rest of the Straw Hats hear it, too, telling them to look down. Usopp finally recognizes it and proposes a bold gambit: jump into the sea. All the Straw Hats wonder what he could be thinking, particularly given Luffy, Robin, and Chopper's mutual problem with the sea. But Usopp insists they jump anyway: they have a friend down there. Once Robin conveys Luffy off the column with Cien Fleur: Delphinium, everyone else jumps. And to their amazement, a friend does wait below them, ready to receive them: the Going Merry.","Doberman, Rob Lucci (K.O.), Usopp, Roronoa Zoro, Franky, Hattori, Monkey D.

Episode 311,Everyone Escapes! The Path to Victory is for the Pirates,27-May-07,"With the arrival of Going Merry, the Straw Hats make their great escape from Enies Lobby. Thanks to Sanji and his clever strategy of closing the Gates of Justice, the Marines are unable to get a clear shot at Merry. The crew fights off the remaining cannon fire, and finally gives their thanks to Merry. Nico Robin finally gets revenge on Spandam by breaking his spine.","The Straw Hat Pirates, Franky, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe leap into the sea to find the Going Merry waiting for them. It takes a moment for the Marines of the Buster Call to realize what's happening. As the rope ladder seemingly drops on its own, Sanji and Nami climb aboard. As Zoro carries Chimney and Gonbe up with him, Franky brings Usopp, and Kokoro tosses Luffy, Robin, and Chopper aboard before climbing on, Sanji starts wondering how the Merry got here and who threw down the rope ladder. Many of the Straw Hats are choking back emotion at being back aboard their ship. Even Franky is wondering just how she got here after being dumped from his hideout by CP9. Luffy tries to thank Robin for getting him out of the tower, but a Fleur covers his mouth. Instead it is Robin who thanks everyone for saving her even when she felt she wasn't worth saving. In the emotional exchange, Chopper regains his ability to move. The Straw Hats soon organize and make plans to escape Enies Lobby.
Spandam is livid and orders all guns on the Merry, even if it means killing Robin. Spandam justifies it (falsely) as orders from Aokiji that Robin is to be killed if she cannot be captured. But when the cannons fire, the shot miss the Merry and hit each other instead. Then, two of the ships crash into each other. Eventually, the Marines discover the reason for their loss of control: the Gates of Justice are closing, meaning the whirlpool currents are returning. Usopp then realizes this was the reason for Sanji's absence earlier. He had been in the third tower looking for the gates' operating lever. Thanks to his thinking ahead, they now have a fighting chance.
As the Merry speeds along, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, and Franky fend off cannonballs from the battleships. Eventually, Luffy crawls his way to the stern using his mouth and insists he join in the fight. Eventually, Zoro and Sanji decide to quiet him by stretching his body like a net and using him to catch and return a large salvo of the cannonballs. Eventually, Nami computes a course along the whirlpool currents, allowing them to outrace the cannonballs. Spandam goes into a tirade over how the mightiest force in the world can't defeat one pirate crew and capture one woman. The tirade eventually stops when the ""hands"" of Nico Robin envelop him and begin to bend him backwards. After all the physical and mental abuse he had inflicted upon her, everyone knew what was coming. With a final, cathartic, ""Clutch!"", Spandam's spine snaps in two and Robin gets her revenge. Nami then directs Franky to finish their escape. With apologies to the crew and ship, Franky fires his Coup de Vent, launching the Merry clear of the whirlpools, the Buster Call, and Enies Lobby altogether. A final Smoke Star from Usopp ensures they cannot pursue.
Meanwhile, back at the Enies Lobby Front Gate, Zambai, Paulie, and the rest of the invasion force have boarded Puffing Tom and are starting their way back to Water 7. Lulu and Tilestone reflect on what's just happened while Mozu and Kiwi appreciatively cuddle up to Paulie in spite of his protests: resulting in a massive nosebleed from him. Everyone is in high spirits as in spite of bumps, bruises, and broken bones, they have taken on the World Government and made it out alive.
Eventually, Admiral Aokiji makes his way to Enies Lobby personally. The Buster Call is adamant in pursuing the Straw Hats, but Aokiji firmly orders everyone to stand down. There is no way to salvage the day now. The Buster Call is supposed to comprise a force equivalent to that of an entire country, yet their current situation is anything but proud and strong. Two ships are sunk, several more are severely damaged. And Enies Lobby stands a smoldering ruin: one of the great strongholds of the entire World Government destroyed. Something this catastrophic cannot be disguised or sugar-coated. The World Government has suffered a complete and utter defeat this day.
At his insistence, Kokoro positions Luffy at his customary position atop the Merry's figurehead. Luffy thanks Merry for coming to their rescue. He also thanks Franky for helping out. Franky has to appreciate the sheer audacity of the Straw Hats and cautions the World Government will be coming after them with a fervor now, but the Straw Hats don't care. To them, saving their friend was more important than defying the World Government and in this most important regard, they have won.","Sanji, Nami, Chimney, Gonbe, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Franky, Kokoro, Monkey D.

Episode 312,Thank You Merry! The Sea of Separation in the Snow,3-Jun-07,"As the crew make their way back to Water 7, they meet the Galley-La Company, Iceburg and all, who are sailing out to greet them. The Going Merry cracks and breaks under her own weight, and the crew say their own farewells as they give the ship a Viking funeral, finally putting her to rest. As she goes up in flames, Merry apologizes and then thanks them for treasuring her for so long.","As they sail away from the smoldering ruins of Enies Lobby, Luffy looks all around the Going Merry for Usopp, wondering who sailed the ship to Enies Lobby to rescue them. He's still being fooled by the Sogeking costume; Usopp shrinks behind it, wondering how long it'll be before Luffy and Chopper figure out that he is Usopp. Sanji tries to get Usopp to admit to the ruse, but he won't. Robin just chuckles knowingly. Sogeking claims that Usopp sailed ahead to Water 7 in another ship. Zoro wonders how they could possibly not realize it's Usopp. Nami is also dumbfounded that nobody else is on Merry.
Zoro and Robin are certain they heard a voice from the ship when they were rescued, but Luffy says it was Merry's voice. But Franky remembers back in Water 7 before the CP9 betrayal, when Usopp told him, Mozu and Kiwi about what happened in Skypiea, how a mysterious figure was seen ""fixing"" the ship. The figure's voice, the same as what they heard at Enies Lobby, said it'll carry the Straw Hats a little while longer. Usopp was certain the figure was the spirit of Merry. Franky said the figure was a Klabautermann, a legendary manifestation of a ship's spirit that fixes the old ship when she wants to sail a little longer.
They are soon met by a massive ship from Galley-La Company, helmed by Iceburg himself. Iceburg was impressed that the Straw Hats and his brother made it back alive and got Robin back. Suddenly, however, the Going Merry lurches in the water before splitting across her beam down the middle, her bow end folding toward the sea. Kaku's diagnosis had come true: her keel snapped. Luffy begs Iceburg for help, not wanting to lose Merry right after she saved them. But Iceburg tells him there's nothing he can do. While the Straw Hats were on their way to Enies Lobby, he heard a banging on Scrap Island, where the ship had come to rest after being flushed by CP9. Although she had been grounded by the Aqua Laguna, he heard a voice saying she wanted to sail just one more time. So Iceburg did as much patching as he could that night, and allowed the hull to go out to sea on the next Aqua Laguna wave. To his shock, he heard a ""thank you"", and the ship appeared to sail off as if she had a mind of her own. Seeing this as a sign, he took one of his company ships out after it, leading him to find them now.
Iceburg says the Going Merry is a magnificent ship which, like the rest of the crew, went well beyond her limits. But she was not going to make it back to Water 7. Luffy finally agrees with Iceburg: it was time to let go. The rest of the occupants board one dinghy as Luffy lags behind in another. He takes a torch, and sets the hull of Merry on fire, proceeding to give the ship a Viking funeral so she would not suffer the loneliness of the sea floor. Luffy muses that it's better that Usopp not be here to see this, but Usopp tells Zoro that he has accepted the fate of his ship. Everyone watches as Luffy slowly drifts away from the ship, their captain thanking Merry again for carrying them.
As the ship burns under newly-falling snow, each of the Straw Hats recall their fondest memories of the ship. As the mast burns down and the ship begins to list, the crew hear Merry's spirit speak. It apologizes for not being able to carry them any further. Luffy cries out that the crew should be apologizing for their inexperience and incompetence at maintaining a ship; that if they knew better, Merry would have never gotten in as bad a shape as she did. At this point, nobody on the crew could keep from crying. But Merry speaks up, saying she was always happy, and knew they loved it.
Merry thanks them one last time as her figurehead, Luffy's ""special seat"", disappears in the growing flames. Luffy cries out her name as she disintegrates to ashes.","Monkey D.

Episode 313,The Disturbance of Peace! The Vice-Admiral with the Fist of Love,10-Jun-07,"Upon their return from Enies Lobby, the Straw Hats rest in Water 7, where their new ship is being built by Franky and the Galley-La Company. Suddenly, they are attacked by Marine Vice-Admiral Garp, whom Luffy calls Grandpa.","Two days have passed since Aqua Laguna, the battle of Enies Lobby, and the tearful passing of the Going Merry. It is a time to gather thoughts, pick up pieces, and resume lives. Zoro sits alone, holding the rusted ruins of Yubashiri and again stuck in a helpless feeling that he hadn't given the sword proper respect, leading to its fate.
Water 7's backstreets begin their annual process of rebuilding, though the ferocity of this year's storm has left a lot more damage than usual, leaving some to wonder if they'll be able to fully repair the damage. Just then, to their joy (and to the screams of the ladies), Paulie leads a group of Galley-La Company shipwrights from Docks 3 and 5 in their off time to help in the rebuilding effort with a goal of fixing everything within a month.
Meanwhile, the Franky Family are hard at work trying to rebuild the Franky House, though their lack of experience at construction is making things hard (and the house crooked). Nearby, Sodom and Gomorrah are convalescing. Chopper had given them both excellent prognoses: Gomorrah's eye damage isn't permanent, and both should be back to 100% soon. Just then, Zambai shows up asking for help: Franky's ""special delivery"" has just arrived at the train station.
Lots of people are outside the massive gates of Dock 1 demanding admittance in spite of vehement refusals from the shipwrights. Many want to thank or apologize to the Straw Hat Pirates while several ladies are hoping to fill in the secretary void left by Kalifa when she was revealed as part of CP9. Inside, guided by Usopp, Oimo and Kashii are passing some time helping out repairing the dock. With Dorry and Brogy still dueling, they can't go to Little Garden, so instead they'll head back to Elbaf. Though they offer to take him with them, Usopp declines, wishing to find a way to rejoin the Straw Hats instead.
Iceburg talks with Franky in his office. He learns that Franky had burned the Pluton blueprints and agrees with the decision. With the blueprints themselves targeted, the only option left was to deny them their prize. But in doing so, Franky will now be targeted by the World Government. Franky then notices the drawing on Iceburg's table. Iceburg reveals that Aqua Laguna's increasing ferocity means Water 7 will not be able to stand much longer unless something drastic is done. Remembering how their mentor Tom had realized the seeming impossible in the sea train Puffing Tom, Iceburg decides on a project no less ambitious: to convert Water 7 into a floating city. Franky is stunned by the idea, but Iceburg reminds him of their mentor, and Franky realizes that he should've expected no less. Just then, the Den Den Mushi rings. Franky answers it and finds Zambai on the other end with great news: his ""treasure"" has finally arrived.
The Straw Hat Pirates are recuperating in a special suite set aside for them in Iceburg's headquarters. Luffy, as expected, is eating ravenously, but Sanji is able to keep up with his captain's appetite. Soon, they receive a visit from Kokoro, Chimney, Gonbe, and Yokozuna (although the latter has to give his sentiments from the window due to his size). Kokoro tries to talk to Luffy, only to learn that Luffy is eating in his sleep: his appetite being that huge. She then tries to talk to Nami to let her know their Log Pose should be set in about three days. But she finds her in an aura of depression. Not only are they without a ship, but all their belongings were in a hotel that got destroyed by Aqua Laguna. But then Kokoro reveals she brought some other people with her: the managers of the hotel. When they reveal they'd come to return the Straw Hats' belongings, Nami is overjoyed: particularly since her precious mikan trees are safe. It turned out after the Iceberg attack, they'd confiscated their belongings figuring to turn them in as pirate loot, and as a result everything survived the storm. Just then Robin and Chopper arrive and soon hear the good news. Now that they have their goods and their remaining 100M, they can look for a new ship.
Just then, Franky, Mozu, and Kiwi show up with their usual flamboyance. After the introductions, though, Franky gets serious and starts telling them the story of the Treasure Tree Adam: about how it stood tall even as countless cities fell beneath its huge canopy. The wood of this tree, Adam Wood, is said to be among the strongest in the world but also extremely rare as pieces of it only fall off infrequently. The reason for the story is because Franky had taken the 200M he'd stolen from the Straw Hats and gone to a black market to buy a supply of this wood. At first the Straw Hats are angry, but Franky begs patience. For many years, he'd sworn off shipbuilding (after his Battle Frankies were used to frame Tom). Yet the desire to build never fully left him, so he ended up drawing plans for one last ship: a dream ship as grand and as as daring as Tom's most famous creation: Gold Roger's Oro Jackson. He has the plans, and now he has the materials, so now, in apology, appreciation, and recompense, Franky announces that he will build the ship for the Straw Hats. Everyone starts celebrating.
Just than, a Marine ship arrives at Water 7. The bulldog figurehead fills everyone with dread, as they know who commands that ship: the infamous Vice-Admiral Garp, who supposedly chased Gold Roger throughout the Pirate King's career. Zoro notices this and is trying to make his way to the others, but as expected he can't find his way. Finally arriving, Garp punches his way straight through the wall and goes straight for the sleeping Luffy. To the surprise of everyone, his punch awakens and hurts Luffy in spite of his rubber body. Luffy then further shocks everyone when he calls Garp his grandpa.","Roronoa Zoro, Shu (flashback), Ipponmatsu (flashback), Tashigi (flashback), Paulie, Tamagon, Kop, Zambai, Kiev, Schollzo, Sodom, Gomorrah, Oimo, Kashii, Usopp, Dorry (flashback), Brogy (flashback), Mozu, Kiwi, Iceburg, Franky, Tyrannosaurus, Tom (flashback), Monkey D.

Luffy's Father Revealed!,17-Jun-07,"Revelations continue as Garp sheds light on Luffy's early childhood, the whereabouts of Shanks, and the identity of Luffy's father, Monkey D. Dragon. Meanwhile, two young marines, under the Vice-Admiral's command, have a joyful reunion with members of the Straw Hats.","Luffy's grandfather has been revealed to be Monkey D. Garp, Marine Vice-Admiral and celebrated hero. Garp expresses disappointment that his torturous training regimes did not inspire Luffy to follow in his footsteps and become a Marine. The two continue to argue and Garp reveals that Shanks, the man who inspired Luffy to become a pirate, is a member of the Four Emperors. Four powerful pirate captains who rule over a part of the Grand Line like emperors and who are the reason for the creation of the Marine Headquarters/Seven Warlords of the Sea alliance.
Garp's speech is cut short by Roronoa Zoro, who arrives back at the Galley-La Company compound and begins fighting the assembled marines. Unfazed, Garp instructs his two best students to combat Zoro. However, the two are easily subdued by Luffy and Zoro and revealed to be faces from the past, Luffy's former companion Koby and his former enemy Helmeppo. Luffy warmly greets his old friend, while snubbing the irate Helmeppo, much to his annoyance. Koby explains that both he and Helmeppo have been training under Garp in order to become Marine Officers.
Garp later orders his men to rebuild the wall he broke down, but at their insistence, he aids them in doing so. Garp then asks Luffy about him meeting his father though Luffy is confused, as he didn't think he had a father. Garp realizes that Luffy's father didn't introduce himself before he states they met in Loguetown, much to Luffy's shock. Garp then reveals that Luffy's father is none other than the infamous revolutionary Monkey D. Dragon, who had been responsible for saving Luffy from Smoker. This news shocks everyone presents as no one knew Dragon had a son, his full name, or more shockingly that he was Garp's son. Luffy then asks why everyone is freaking out so much. Apparently, Luffy had never been told about his father as his crew tell him of his father's reputation.
Finally, Robin explains to Luffy that Dragon is the leader of the Revolutionary Army, an infamous rebel force that is openly opposing the World Government. This force has already been responsible for the overthrow of several monarchies, threatening to destabilize the Government itself. As a result, the World Government have labeled Dragon the most dangerous criminal in the world. Because of his reputation, showing Dragon's face or mentioning his name terrifies anyone familiar with him. Garp concludes that he has probably revealed too much and instructs everyone to forget what he said.","Monkey D. Garp, Monkey D.

He also talked about the New World and how the pirate who conquers it will become the Pirate King. Garp leaves the Straw Hat Pirates free. While everybody is busy celebrating their huge victory at Enies Lobby, Robin is confronted by Aokiji.","Garp reveals that he won't capture his own grandson. He more or less came to make sure he was okay and to let Koby and Helmeppo see him. While the Marines repair the damage to Iceburg's building, he lets the three take some time to catch up and chat, though he does slug Luffy once more when Luffy doesn't show some reluctance. Nami, Chopper, and Sanji come to realize just where Luffy gets his stubborn and stupid streaks.
After Garp leaves, the rest of the Straw Hats discuss Garp's revelations. Robin in particular is amazed at the connection to Dragon, not realizing Luffy would be connected to something even more dangerous than the scholars of her home island, Ohara. Zoro isn't with Luffy because his association with Koby was tenuous; his history is more with Luffy than with anyone else. Nami is notably absent; Chopper notes she'd wanted to seek out some Marine intel while they were here but instead went to the pool with Kokoro and Chimney. Hearing that, Sanji rushes off to the pool.
Outside, Luffy learns to his surprise that the Marines have found a way to safely cross the Calm Belt, meaning they don't have to go through Reverse Mountain to reach the Grand Line. Thanks to the work of a scientist named Dr. Vegapunk, Marines have covered the bottoms of their ships with seastone. Because of Kairoseki's natural sea energy emissions, this hides their presence from the Sea Kings meaning as long as they can address the issue of power, they can come and go more or less freely, giving them a huge maneuverability advantage.
Unknown to them, a Baby Den Den Mushi is hidden near their location. Nami was actually at the pool and listening in on Koby through a Black Den Den Mushi. She files the knowledge of the Kairoseki trick away for future reference. She also learns that it was Vegapunk who found the way to infuse Devil Fruits into inanimate objects—resulting in things like Spandam's Elephant Sword Funkfreed—as well as more insight as to how Devil Fruits actually work. The conversation then turns to Garp, revealing that all three admit he's an advocate of ""tough love"": he may test you to the verge of death, but in the end you become stronger for it. Plus Koby and Helmeppo are grateful for him taking them in after the incident of Axe-Hand Morgan's escape. Nami finally decides she'll learn no more secrets and finally goes for a swim, but she almost inhales water when she passes under Kokoro in mermaid form: some things will just never cease to shock.
Regretfully, Luffy, Koby, and Helmeppo's reunion is brief, as they have to go back to Headquarters and resume training. But before going, Koby leaves a tantalizing fact: the back half of the Grand Line is known as ""The New World"". It's becoming a focal point for both pirates and Marines, and the next Pirate King will likely be crowned there. Luffy realizes he needs to be part of this action. Koby's hope is that one day, even as opponents, they can meet there and vie to see who's dream is realized first: Luffy being the next Pirate King or he becoming the next Admiral. Luffy acknowledges this and without a hint of ridicule challenges him to realize that dream and meet him in The New World as a worthy rival. Encouraged, Koby rushes off with a confused Helmeppo following.
Back on Garp's ship, Koby wonders if the Straw Hats are fully aware of just how the World Government is depicting the Enies Lobby incident. Helmeppo points out that Koby's seeing the darker side of the World Government: one determined to maintain its stranglehold on power by hook or crook. Cover-ups like this are to be expected. Just then Garp stops their reminiscing and gets them back to training.
Back at the pool, Sanji is cooking up a barbecue. Everyone agrees it's delicious, and the taste is enough to even overlook Kokoro in mermaid form for the time being. Just then, Zambai and the Franky Family join them, encouraged by the news that Luffy was awake. Luffy invites them to the meal, starting off a comical cavalcade of other new arrivals: Oimo and Kashii, Sodom and Gomorrah, Iceburg and the Galley-La Company shipwrights, Franky, Mozu, and Kiwi. Even Usopp manages to join in his Sogeking disguise. What had started as a friendly little barbecue among the crew soon turns into a gigantic celebration.
As the sun begins to set, Robin finds a little peace and quiet against a wall. Just then, a familiar voice addresses her from the other side of the wall. It's Aokiji. He starts by asking why Robin didn't run away like she had for 20 years. Robin replies that she can't run away anymore: not when she now has finally found her friends. Then Aokiji drops a bombshell: Jaguar D. Saul, whom he'd been forced to kill 20 years ago, was a close friend of his. But while he'd been compelled by duty that day, he also allowed him one boon: that being to make sure Robin was safe. So for 20 years he'd kept tabs on the homeless, friendless Robin. By the time of their encounter prior to Water 7, Aokiji was prepared to believe Robin was becoming too dangerous. Then Enies Lobby happened and complicated the matter. No one had really thought the Straw Hats would go through CP9 and a Buster Call to rescue her. So he asks one more time, ""Have you finally found a tree to call home?"" Robin finally answers, ""Yes."" And Aokiji is finally relieved. With true friends, Robin can stop running away from her past and stand tall as the last survivor of Ohara. He tells Robin to live her life with resolve and then leaves. By the time Robin reaches the spot where Aokiji had been, all that's there is an icy ""X"". She's finally drawn back to the party by Luffy. As Aokiji calmly bikes away, Robin realizes that Saul's greatest wish has indeed been granted; she is homeless and friendless no more.","Monkey D.

Episode 316,Shanks Moves! Ceremony to the Rampaging Age!,1-Jul-07,"Shanks meets up with Whitebeard despite all the efforts made by the World Government to avoid it. His main reason for the meeting: a request to stop Ace from chasing after his former-crew mate Blackbeard. When Shanks's request is denied, the two clash, resulting in an enormous gash across the sky. Meanwhile in Water 7, the Franky Family is shocked to discover that they've been completely removed from the report on the events at Enies Lobby while the Galley-La Company helps Franky with building the Straw Hats' new ship.","The episode starts by showing everyone at Water 7 partying. Sogeking singing, Franky Family dancing, etc. The scene changes to a fleet of destroyed Marine ships. An unharmed pirate ship proceeds past them. Meanwhile, the Five Elders are informed that the Whitebeard Pirates and the Red Hair Pirates have broke through the Marine's defenses and that the two crews are arranged to have a meeting.
On Whitebeard's ship, Whitebeard is informed of Shanks arrival. At Navy Headquarters, Marine soldiers are on standby after hearing the news of the meeting. Shanks boards Whitebeard's ship, as Marco orders the newcomers to go inside the ship. However, the message comes too late. Members of the Whitebeard pirates faint when Shanks walk pass them using his Supreme King Haki. Shanks apologizes, since it hard to stay calm on an enemy ship. Whitebeard orders his men to leave. When the crew is out of sight, Shanks prepared drinks of alcohol for the two captains.
After a sip of the drink, Whitebeard said Shanks has made quite a leap as a pirate since Gol D. Roger's death, and asked about Buggy. Shanks replied that he hasn't heard anything about him since they parted ways at Loguetown after Roger's execution. Whitebeard was curious and asked why Shanks was missing an arm. He replied that he bet it on the new era. Shanks changed the subject to his scars, pointing to one scar across his face. Declaring it came from a member of Whitebeard's crew; Marshall D. Teach. He then asked Whitebeard to stop Ace's search for Teach. Whitebeard becomes furious, and says that Blackbeard needs to learn his lesson. He then throws his bottle at Shanks. Shanks draws his sword and said that the world will be thrown into chaos. The two clash swords, and the sky divides from the impact.
The next day, the Franky Family reads the newspaper on Enies Lobby, relieved that they were not mentioned. At the Galley-La Company, the Straw Hat Pirates react to the news, wondering why the Franky Family was not in the article. Sanji and Chopper are excited, as they can't wait for their new bounties. Meanwhile, Franky prepares the new ship for the Straw Hat Pirates. Iceburg arrives and offers to help, then Paulie, Tilestone, and Peepley Lulu appears and offers to help as well. Back at the Galley-La Company, Luffy learns that Franky is building a ship for them. Nami informs everyone that they still have the money to spend and recommends buying furniture for the ship.

Sanji is amazed by the flavor, but cannot figure out how the old man made it. Intent on discovering the secret, he searches the city for seasonings that might have been used.

Episode 320,Everyone's Finally Wanted! The Crew of Over Six Hundred Million!,19-Aug-07,"While Usopp plots to get back in the Straw Hat Pirates, Franky, Iceburg and the Galley-La foremen are hard at work putting the finishing touches on the new ship. They also talk a little about what they are going to face next, which is the Florian Triangle which they must pass before going to their next island, Fish-Man Island As the Straw Hats were told that the ship is finished, they were interrupted by the Franky Family, who revealed that they all have bounties now, and plead with Luffy to take Franky along with them since Franky is also a wanted man.","Construction continues on the Straw Hat Pirates' new ship as the sun sets. Although having the help of Yokozuna, Paulie, Lulu, and Tilestone, Iceburg and Franky are doing the bulk of the work: surprising everyone else with their seemingly boundless energy. Even well into the night, the Dock 1 shipwrights are amazed at the ""gusto"" being displayed by their boss and his ""bro"" and realize that Tom's Workers still live on in these two incredible shipwrights. As they continue to work, Iceburg has a chuckle. When Franky accosts him, he replies that he never realized that Franky had so much talent hidden away. He remembers the Battle Frankies. While they may have had disagreements over them, and while they were used to frame Tom, he now feels they were just the warmups to this masterpiece: a work of sheer shipbuilding genius. He can't help but compliment Franky with all honesty. Kokoro recalls their youth. Tom had said they would both become great shipwrights in the future, and here Kokoro realizes his words are ringing true. Then Franky points out one crucial similarity. The crime that eventually sealed Tom's fate was building Gold Roger's Oro Jackson. And now Iceburg stands building a ship for a pirate crew who will no doubt become no less infamous. Iceburg replies that he will deal with that if it ever comes. Tom himself had said that a ship is a ship. What happens to it is the decision of its crew. So, like Tom, Iceburg will build this ship the same way every ship at Galley-La Company is made: on the belief that he is just building another ship. And in this case, he's also helping to fulfill a dream.
Franky, meanwhile, wonders back to the time he resolved to stop Puffing Tom from taking Tom away to his death. He had vowed never to build a ship again, fearing they may once again be turned against the people he cared about. The train runs him over, leaving him broken and barely alive. At that point, a derelict iron ship passes. With his remaining strength, he climbs aboard and feels at home: a broken, battered body alone on a broken, battered ship. He resolves first and foremost to rebuild himself. He then recalled his conversation with Iceburg back when he returned to Water 7: how in the end Iceburg was just happy to see him alive again. Franky wonders who's more stubborn: he for defying the World Government even now, or Iceburg for daring to take them on by helping him now.
Usopp in the meantime is continuing to develop ways to apologize to the Straw Hats. He then sneaks to their suite to find out where the crew stands with him. He notes Zoro standing defiant on one side of the room and the rest of the crew on the other side. Usopp thinks the crew's getting frictious and decides to employ a scenario, but then Nami spoils this by closing the curtains so no one gets to see him. So he leaves, knowing time is now against him. If this keeps up, they really will leave without him.
Back at the construction site, the Franky Family offers everyone a meal break from their work. Out of courtesy, Iceburg and Franky are given first dibs. As they eat, Iceburg asks Franky what he'll do once the ship is finished. At this, Franky can't answer. Iceburg suggests he go with the Straw Hats. After all, they are in need of a shipwright. But Franky stands firm. He'll remain here with his Family. Zambai, however, wonders if he may not be entirely truthful. Paulie, Lulu, and Tilestone are amazed once again at Iceburg and Franky's will to continue working when they're too tired to even have their snacks. But the conversation stirs Franky's thought. The Straw Hats were something else, and allying with them at Enies Lobby proved quite a blast, so this dream ship of his will be entrusted to them. Their work continues until sunrise, even after everyone else except Kokoro collapses in exhaustion. Somehow, Franky and Iceburg are able to egg each other on to greater and greater efforts.
As dawn breaks, Nami wakes to encouraging news: one week has passed, and her Log Pose is finally set. Once their ship is finished, they can set sail and resume their journey. Kokoro then points out something to Nami: the needle is pointing slightly downward. This is because the next leg of their journey will be taking them to the halfway point of their journey along the Grand Line. Their next stop will be Fish-Man Island which is at the bottom of the ocean. The mention of Fish-Man brings up mixed feelings. While Sanji is excited at the prospect of a place bound to be full of mermaids (until he remembers that Kokoro is a mermaid, too), the word stirs up unpleasant memories in many of the others: particularly Nami, who doesn't forget the time the Arlong and his fish-men had held her home of Cocoyasi Village hostage, though Zoro reminds her they were ruthless because they were also pirates. Then Kokoro points out that getting there will be the hard part: not just because they need to find a way to the sea floor but because the route indicated by the Log Pose passes through some very dangerous waters: an infamous place known as the Florian Triangle where ships of all types have vanished without a trace or returned without their crews. Nami is initially scared to go until Robin points out that ghost ships are often treasure ships, too. Luffy's already itching to go in hopes of encountering zombies and skeletons, and the talk of treasure ships makes Zoro wonder if he can find a new sword among such loot.
Just then, Chimney, Gonbe, Mozu and Kiwi arrive with great news. The new ship is ready, ahead of schedule. But moments later, Zambai and the Franky Family arrive as well, and their news is not so great. The World Government has issued new wanted posters, and for the first time, the entire Straw Hat crew is wanted:""Straw Hat"" Luffy's bounty triples from 100,000,000 to 300,000,000. Luffy is jubilant at his increased notoriety. ""Pirate Hunter"" Zoro's bounty doubles from 60,000,000 to 120,000,000. Like Luffy, Zoro reacts positively since more infamy means greater challengers. To her shock, Nami gets the epithet ""Cat Burglar"" and a bounty of 16,000,000. Her photo is provocative due to the photographer pretending to be from a magazine. Chopper is dismayed that he has a bounty of only 50, having been mistaken for the crew's pet. His epithet is ""Cotton Candy Lover"". ""Devil Child"" Robin gets a modest raise from 79,000,000 to 80,000,000, mostly to justify updating her picture to show her as an adult. Robin is mildly amused. Sanji's excitement over finally being wanted (he earns the epithet ""Black Leg"" and a bounty of 77,000,000) disappears when he learns his wanted picture isn't a photograph but rather a very inaccurate drawing. Though not present, Usopp (as Sogeking) also has a bounty: this one worth 30,000,000. Zambai then reveals he has one more wanted poster to show them"" ""Cyborg"" Franky, with a bounty of 44,000,000.
As Iceburg had predicted, Franky is now a wanted man. This means it's no longer safe for Franky to stay at Water 7. So they beg the Straw Hats to take him with them.","Franky, Yokozuna, Iceburg, Paulie, Peepley Lulu, Tilestone, Chimney, Gonbe, Kokoro, Tom (flashback), Spandam (flashback), Usopp, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, in an effort to force him into joining the crew, the Franky Family steal Franky's swim briefs, leading to the destruction of several buildings in Water 7 in the ensuing chase.","After Zambai and the Franky Family beg Luffy to take Franky with them, now that he is wanted, Luffy calmly agrees since he had been seeking a shipwright anyway. But Zambai realizes (after watching him last night) that convincing him will be another matter. Leaving Mozu and Kiwi behind, they proceed towards the Franky House (where Franky is returning right now), saying what they are about to do is a matter between men. As the Straw Hat Pirates prepare to leave, Roronoa Zoro reminds them of their stance regarding Usopp. Urged on by Mozu and Kiwi, they make their way to Scrap Island. At Marineford, Attach the photographer has to explain why Sanji's wanted poster does not have a photo. He shows the original result of his effort a completely black photo. While Attach thinks this to be the result of mystic power, it was because he forgot to take the lens cap off.
The Straw Hats arrive to see their new ship enshrouded. Surprisingly, while Iceburg, Paulie, Lulu, Tilestone, and Yokozuna are present (albeit asleep), Franky is not. As he wakes, Iceburg notes Franky did not want to be present at the unveiling, but Franky did leave a message: the King of Pirates should sail a ship graced by the King of Beasts. With a grand flourish, Iceburg unveils their new ship graced with a lion figurehead. Before them stands a brig sloop, at least twice as big as the Going Merry, and packed full of incredible things. Even as the crew take in their new ship, Iceburg conveys something important about Franky. Although he would like more than anything to accompany the Straw Hats on their journey, Franky feels he owes an obligation to Water 7 and in particular to the Franky Family whom he has been training and protecting for years. He is being stubborn, so if they want Franky as a shipwright, they are going to have to get rough.
The dirty business is beginning right now as the Franky Family react to Franky relaxing at the Franky House. Despite their best efforts, they cannot hold back tears at what they are about to do. Zambai starts by asking why he will not go with the Straw Hats. Franky points to the shoddily rebuilt Franky House as proof they still need his guidance. Zambai then displays the wanted poster and points out that he is now wanted and cannot stay at Water 7, buy Franky blows it off, wondering if they are using this as a ruse to get rid of him. Suddenly, one of them sneaks up and pulls off his swim briefs. The Franky Family starts running in the direction of Scrap Island with Franky in naked pursuit. As each member falls, he passes the briefs along to the next one ahead. The chase passes through the back streets, with Franky retaliating when he can and causing collateral damage along with cries of indecency from the public. Just as the last member of the Family is about to get caught, he finds Luffy. As he takes the briefs, Luffy thanks Franky for the ship, but Franky continues to demand his briefs back. He finally shoots at Luffy, but Luffy passes the briefs on to Chopper who leads Franky into a trap. Zoro and Sanji grab Franky and stuff him into the Franky Family's Anything-Shot Cannon, which then shoots him towards Scrap Island. He finally comes down legs up for all to see. As he comes to, he turns to see Luffy aboard his new ship, still holding his briefs and saying if he wants them back, he has to join the crew.","Kiev, Monkey D.

Episode 322,Goodbye my Lovable Followers! Franky Departs,2-Sep-07,"Franky has chased his swim briefs to the Straw Hats' new ship, but still refuses to go with them, necessitating some extra ""persuasion"" from Robin and Iceburg. While she works on him, Zoro and Sanji find out their time in Water 7 is growing limited.","Franky stands on Scrap Island after chasing his swim briefs through Water 7 to the Straw Hats' new ship. He demands that Luffy, who has his swim briefs currently, return it. Although somewhat humiliated, with the people of the city yelling at him that he's a ""pervert"", he still stands proudly against leaving, even posing before the ship shamelessly. The townspeople cover their children's eyes, and Luffy is impressed by Franky's determination. Nami just says Franky is a pervert, much like the townspeople were calling him. Robin, however, has an idea, and asks if she could get a little rough with him. Luffy did remember Iceburg telling him they might have to.
With Luffy's consent, Robin uses Dos Fleur Grab to grab and squeeze Franky's testicles. He shrieks and starts thrashing about in terrible pain. All the townspeople and those on the new ship cringe as Robin tortures him. Mozu and Kiwi squeal that they would be plucked off like ripe fruit. Franky is brought to the ground in agony. Luffy protests that he still wants Franky to be a man when he joins the crew. Robin responds that pirates should not let go of treasure they find without good reason.
Franky continues to protest that he could not leave the island, and that he no longer wishes to be a shipwright; the Straw Hats' ship would be his last. At this point, Iceburg steps up and says he remembers Franky's dream when growing up was to build the ultimate ship, and sail on it as its shipwright. He then suggests that Franky's real intention for not leaving was atonement for Tom being taken away for execution at Enies Lobby. Iceburg tells Franky that even if he and Tom forgave him, Franky also needs to finally forgive himself. As Franky comes to tears, Iceburg says it's time for him to start living his dreams again.
The Franky Family tosses him a bag; they've already packed his things. Zambai apologizes for making him run through Water 7 naked, but they were only looking out for him, and wanted him to be happy. By this time, Robin has stopped grabbing him, even though he continues to roll around the junk piles as if in agony. She also says she only squeezed him once. His tears are coming for a different reason as he recalls how he built the Franky Family by gathering up the rogues and the destitute of the city, taking them under his wing and recruiting them to the defense of Water 7. In despair, Franky asks his family how they could possibly survive without him. The group tells their ""big brother"" that they have learned enough to keep Water 7 safe in his absence, and they would always be his followers.
Suddenly, Zoro and Sanji run through the group and down to the ship. Zoro alerts Luffy that his grandfather, Vice Admiral Garp, has returned, and is after them despite having promised to leave them be earlier. Sanji notes that Franky still isn't wearing his pants, and Luffy throws his swim briefs back to him. Franky shows his confidence again, saying that the Straw Hats were amateurs at ship repair, and a ship as grand as their new one would be something to pity without a proper shipwright. With that, Franky agrees to join their crew. Franky thinks one last time back to Tom and the construction of the Sea Train. Leaving Galley-La Company and the Franky Family behind, he gives one more pose before jumping on the ship. Sanji reminds Franky to put his swim briefs back on.","Franky, Monkey D.

Episode 323,"Departure from the Water City! The Distinction of a Man, Usopp's Duel",9-Sep-07,"The departure of the Straw Hats from Water 7 is hastened when Vice Admiral Garp, under watch from Aokiji, comes to attack them. Usopp has to do some soul-searching to realize what he really needs to do to rejoin the crew.","With his Marines having located the Straw Hat Pirates, Vice Admiral Garp sets sail in his ship for Scrap Island. He and his crew are annoyed with the order from Fleet Admiral Sengoku to exterminate the Straw Hats there at Water 7, but saw little choice in the matter with Admiral Aokiji on-board his ship. With the Franky Family calling their farewells to Franky, the Straw Hats set sail on their new ship. But some of the crew are concerned, because one person is missing. Luffy knows.
Flashback to a few days before at Galley-La Company's headquarters, where Sanji told Luffy about Usopp's plan to ask to rejoin the crew. At first Luffy is eager to take Usopp back, but Zoro speaks up with an objection. He says it is not right for Usopp to return without at least an apology after the way he quit originally, especially with the duel he fought with Luffy over the Going Merry. Zoro says it is not right for Usopp to be accepted back so easily after the duel, and they must respect its result. He insists that allowing Usopp back without such would be an insult to Luffy's authority as captain, and that he will quit if Luffy allows himself to be walked all over like that. He says it is time for them to stop treating being pirates as a game, and that Usopp needs to learn to a lesson on not quitting so easily. Luffy understands Zoro's point, and agrees.
Back in the present, Luffy is convinced (at least outwardly) that Usopp is not returning, but is certain they will run into each other again in the future. Meanwhile, Usopp is running through Water 7, eager to return to the crew and certain they will welcome him back with open arms. On the ship, Nami asks Luffy to wait just a little while longer, but a cannonball splashing in the water signals their time is up. Vice Admiral Garp has caught up with them. Everybody, especially Luffy, is surprised that it is Garp attacking them. Garp uses a megaphone to hail his grandson. Garp apologizes for the change in situation, since he said previously he would let Luffy leave Water 7, but does say he will take care of the matter by himself.
With that, Garp uses his superhuman strength to hurl cannonballs at the ship far harder than a cannon would fire them, an attack he calls Genkotsu Meteor. He fires a warning shot that explodes on the shore by the ship, blowing it out into open water. He calls for more cannonballs so he can proceed with Genkotsu Ryūseigun: he plans on rapid-firing cannonballs at Luffy's ship. Luffy's crew prepares to fend off the attack. Chopper sniffs the air, and senses that Usopp has arrived by the shore of Water 7.
Usopp makes it to the shore above Scrap Island and runs through the gathered crowd to see what is going on. Zambai asks him what he is still doing here. He looks up, and sees the new ship as it sails away. Usopp panics, not knowing why they'd leave without him after his help at Enies Lobby. They could not possibly have forgotten that he is really Sogeking, could they? Seeing the attack begin, he jumps to Scrap Island and runs after the ship along the shore, trying to get their attention as they fend off Garp's constant rain of cannonballs. Chopper tries to tell them that Usopp has arrived, but they are too busy defending the ship.
Usopp calls out to his shipmates, trying to get their attention. All the while, he is in denial that they could have taken his resignation from the crew seriously, and that is why they are leaving without him. He reaches the shore of Scrap Island, and calls for them to stop fooling around. Chopper tries one more time to get Luffy and Zoro to listen for Usopp, but they claim they cannot hear him. Usopp watches in growing despair as the ship sails further away under Garp's attack. Usopp thinks back to the circumstances of his departure and sinks to his knees, realizing finally what his hasty resignation is about to cost him.
With tears streaming, Usopp screams to the ship that he is sorry. Luffy finally stops, hearing his mea culpa. Usopp apologizes for being so selfish and stubborn, and that he wishes he could take back what he had said when he left. He begs to be allowed back in the crew. With that, Luffy stretches his arm out to the shore, and screams for Usopp to grab on. He pulls Usopp back onto the boat, tears streaming, as the rest of the crew splits time between rejoicing at the heartfelt reunion and continuing the defense of their ship. With their crew finally complete, Luffy orders his men to fight off the bombardment so they can continue their journey.","Monkey D.

Episode 324,Circling Bounties! The Hometowns Dance as the Ship Advances!,16-Sep-07,The Thousand Sunny finally gets its name and the Straw Hat Pirates make their getaway from Vice Admiral Garp as their hometowns get word of their new bounties.,"Usopp is finally reconciled with the Straw Hat Pirates and has been pulled on-board their new ship. But they remain under attack from Vice Admiral Garp. Franky orders Zoro to furl up the sails so he can fire up a secret escape mechanism.
But before they get underway, Franky insists they name the ship first. Luffy comes up with a bunch of odd, unsuitable animal combinations. Franky says the name should be based on the masthead, which is shaped vaguely like a lion's head, though most at Galley-La Company ""mistook"" it for a sunflower. Iceburg and Franky agreed that it was suitable for the future ship of the Pirate King. Iceburg is inspired, envisioning a ship that can brightly cross a thousand seas like the Sun. He therefore suggested the name Thousand Sunny. The crew ignores Franky's lion-based name idea and go with Iceburg's idea instead.
Franky goes below deck to power up his escape device, remarking that Water 7 will disappear from view momentarily. Luffy calls out to his grandfather and says they are leaving now. He says his goodbye to Koby, but still doesn't know Helmeppo's name. He whacks away one last cannonball from Garp telling him it's no use which infuriates Garp who has to be held back by Helmeppo. Luffy then proclaims his thanks to Iceburg, Galley-La and the Franky Family, but he's too far away for them to hear him. Garp then gets out a comically-enormous cannonball and swings it at the Thousand Sunny. Just as the crew think they're all going to die, Franky's ""Miracle Emergency Acceleration Device"" fires: Coup de Burst! Powered by three barrels of cola, the Thousand Sunny launches into the air suddenly, getting away.
Everyone on Garp's ship is surprised, even Aokiji. Garp almost looks pleased at his grandson's escape, and starts laughing remarking ""Not bad Luffy."" As the Straw Hats sail off in the sky, Usopp remembers the flying sensation from when the Going Merry flew up the Knock Up Stream to Skypiea. Franky boasts that the soul of the Going Merry lives on in the Thousand Sunny. There's not a thing that Merry could do that the new ship cannot. Back at Water 7, Oimo and Kashii are seen assisting the rebuilding process. The Franky Family frets a bit because they're out of food, but Iceburg comes to their aid, giving them jobs at Galley-La. Word begins to spread about the new bounties for the Straw Hats. Smoker gets the new wanted posters from Tashigi after a pirate bust. He says other pirates will start to defer to the Straw Hats now, and vows he will crush Luffy when they reach the New World.
On the Baratie, Zeff immediately recognizes the terrible composite sketch made of Sanji. His former fellow chefs all laugh at it. Regardless, his poster replaces Luffy's at the center of the restaurant, and they use it as a selling point, that the restaurant is Sanji's home. Back at Foosha Village, the villagers once more rejoice at Luffy's growing infamy. Woop Slap is again annoyed by the raucous partying. Makino likes his crew, especially his ""cute pet"". Woop Slap is annoyed that an enemy of the World Government came from Foosha, and wonders what Garp is doing about it. He also wonders if Dadan knows about Luffy's recent actions. At Syrup Village, the Usopp Pirates and Kaya instantly recognize Sogeking as Usopp. The rest of the village doesn't believe it, however. Kaya goes back to her medical studies so she can be ready if Usopp needs to be healed if/when he returns. The boys say they'll beat Usopp up if he ever hurts Kaya.
At Shimotsuki Village, Koushirou admits to his pupils that he taught Zoro how to fight, but swears he didn't teach Zoro how to be a pirate. Now all the kids want to be pirates in addition to great fighters. He doesn't mind too much, as long as Zoro keeps kendo at his heart. At Cocoyashi Village, Genzo is irate at Nami's wanted poster, yet has it blown up behind his desk. Nojiko sates him by pointing out Nami's expression, saying it's proof that Luffy has indeed not taken away her smile. At the Sakura Kingdom, Dalton calls Dr. Kureha down from her castle, and shows her the latest wanted posters for the Straw Hats. Dalton is certain the Marines are mistaken about Chopper's measly 50 bounty. Dr. Kureha is just happy that she gets to see him again.
At Arabasta, Igaram, Chaka, Pell and King Cobra are shocked that Nico Robin, ""Miss All Sunday"" of Baroque Works, is now affiliated with the Straw Hats. They are concerned that Vivi will not take this news well, but she already knows, and doesn't care. She trusts Luffy's decisions even if nobody ever understands his motives. Yet again, they are surprised by the princess' maturity. At Baltigo, a yet-unseen island on the Grand Line, the Revolutionary Army discusses a successful coup at Centaurea in South Blue. Their leader, ""Revolutionary"" Dragon, sees the stack of wanted posters for the Straw Hats. It's noted that the Marines made the entire crew wanted due to the events at Enies Lobby. His associates mention Luffy's relation to Garp, apparently unaware of their leader's relation to both men. Dragon believes his son's exploits will get more people to question the World Government, and welcomes the day when they will finally meet. Back on the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats celebrate the returns of Usopp and Robin; their new shipwright, Franky; and their new ship.","Monkey D.

Episode 325,The Most Evil Ability! Blackbeard's Darkness Attacks Ace,23-Sep-07,"Three days before Luffy left Water 7, Ace finally catches up to Blackbeard on Banaro Island, but his attempt to fight him reveals Teach's darkest secret: the control of the Yami Yami no Mi, said to be the most evil of the Devil Fruits. As fire and darkness collide, the island is destroyed. The outcome is left unrevealed, but Ace's hat is shown lying on the ground. It is said that the fight between them is the trigger for a great event yet to come.","While the rest of the world is finding out about the Straw Hats' new bounties and events at Enies Lobby, Blackbeard is seen reading an earlier account of the Straw Hat’s activities at Enies Lobby, commenting that their bounties should rise afterwards. Lafitte wonders if the Straw Hats hijacked a Sea Train from Water 7 to get to Enies Lobby. Van Auger comments that Water 7 isn’t too far from the Blackbeard Pirate’s current location and thinks they’ll cross paths again while Doc Q suggests that fate may allow them to meet again and take action when it happens. Jesus Burgess laughs while carrying a sack and asks what they’re waiting for, and Blackbeard responds in agreement and announces his intent to stop the Straw Hats before the Marines can.
Meanwhile, the townspeople are seen defeated and scattered around. As Blackbeard's crew walks ahead, they pass by an observing Ace, who is seen squatting in a roof near them. Ace calls out Blackbeard by referencing him as Teach, stating that they need to talk. The narration then plays, confirming that history-changing events are taking place in this small island called Banaro Island, three days before the Straw Hat’s fate and bounties were revealed to the world.
Blackbeard looks up in surprise and addresses him as Commander Ace, to which Ace responds by stating that he has no right to call him that anymore. Lafitte comments that this must be the famous pirate “Fire Fist” Ace that they’re witnessing. Ace confirms Lafitte’s address and then notes that Blackbeard is a captain of his own crew now. Blackbeard responds that it’s been a while since they interacted, and teases Ace if he’s been looking for him. Ace responds to Blackbeard to cut his act and that there is only one reason for him to be here. In response, Blackbeard asks him to join his crew instead of fighting, claiming that he has the perfect plan to become the Pirate King while mentioning that Whitebeard’s days are numbered. Blackbeard further mentions that he plans to head to Water 7 to kill Luffy and present it as a gift to the World Government.
A surprised Ace then reveals to Blackbeard that he won’t let him kill his younger brother. Upon refusing to join Blackbeard’s crew, Auger shoots Ace with a bullet harmlessly piercing through his Mera Mera no Mi’s Logia Devil Fruit abilities. Ace smirks and comments that Blackbeard’s crew weren’t taught manners, to which Ace retaliates at Auger with Fire Gun. From behind, Burgess launches a hotel towards Ace to which he burns up with Flame Commandment Fire Pillar. The rubble lands near Blackbeard who yells at Auger and Burgess, warning them that they’re not strong enough to fight Ace by themselves. As Burgess apologizes, Ace launches Fire Fist at Blackbeard’s crew, managing to hit their captain. Engulfed in flames, Blackbeard rolls around in pain while his unscathed crew runs to his aid. As Auger fans the flames out, Ace walks towards them. Blackbeard dismisses his crew’s help and tells them to stand back. As Blackbeard recovers, he understands Ace’s intent to finish him, before admitting to the crime of murdering their former crew mate, fourth division commander Thatch.
Blackbeard reveals that he had no choice but to kill Thatch in order to obtain the Yami Yami no Mi, a Devil Fruit he’s been chasing after for decades and so the rule goes in Whitebeard’s ship: whoever finds a devil fruit can claim it as theirs to eat. Blackbeard emphasizes that he memorized the shapes and colors of many Devil Fruits until he recognized the Yami Yami no Mi sitting in Thatch’s hand. He further states that by lying low in Whitebeard’s crew, he would have the best shot at finding it someday. Blackbeard tells Ace to witness the power he gained, stating its power is unique among Logia types. With his right hand, Blackbeard forms a black pillar into the sky and tells Ace that just as he is made out of fire, his own body is made out of darkness. The townspeople catch sight of Blackbeard’s dark pillar, describing it as the weird black smoke from before. Seeing no other options, the townspeople run away in fear.
Blackbeard continues his fruit’s display, stating that it is said to be the most powerful of them all. He tells Ace to witness his power, and Ace urges him on. Meanwhile, Blackbeard’s crew is seen running away, with Burgess stating that their captain may kill them if they don’t get away in time. Doc Q falls over and is dragged away by Burgess and Auger. Stronger subsequently collapses behind them, and Burgess proceeds to yell at him for also falling down.
The pillar descends into Blackbeard’s position and then spreads out, engulfing the ground of the town. The remaining townspeople observe the darkness spreading further out, wondering if it’ll suck them up as well. More of them run away, as Blackbeard continues his speech about his power: darkness is like gravity, and it swallows everything around it. Ace acknowledges his claims, but mentions its not surrounding him. Blackbeard tells him this is intentional, as he wants him to see the power of the Yami Yami no Mi. Blackbeard uses Black Hole, which destroys and sucks up the entire town. The townspeople watch in fear as Blackbeard continues his speech, stating his power crushes and compresses everything his darkness touches. Moments later, the townspeople see the vast emptiness that is left of their town. With his left hand swallowing the remnants of the dark hole, he uses Liberation, and a black pillar forms out of his back and throws out everything the dark hole had just swallowed up and destroyed.
Blackbeard marvels at his power, stating that this was worth killing Thatch over before pausing to see green balls of light appear towards him, which is Ace’s Firefly Fiery Doll. Blackbeard is engulfed in flames and withers in pain, to which Ace comments that he understands his darkness power, but not at his sensitivity to pain. Ace states that as a Logia type, the flames should not hurt, let alone hit Blackbeard. Blackbeard’s power absorbs the flames and responds that his power absorbs everything around him including pain, stating that he is unable to simply turn into an element and dodge an attack. He claims the pain he then receives is much greater than what a normal human feels. Even so, he states the tradeoff is worth utilizing the power, stating that there is one more thing his power can swallow. With his left hand, he summons Black Vortex, which utilizes gravity to pull a Devil Fruit user into his grasp. Ace’s hat flies away as he is being pulled in, and comments that the power is indeed strong. Blackbeard appears before him, being able to grab Ace’s shoulder and both of them realize what had just happened. Blackbeard punches Ace and sends him flying towards the rubble, commenting that it must have been a while since the last time he was hurt like that. Blackbeard finally states that his power can even absorb Devil Fruit powers, so long as he is in contact with the user.
Wiping blood off his mouth, Ace states then all he has to do is avoid contact. Blackbeard reminds him that gravity is stronger than he thinks, and he summons Black Vortex. As Ace is pulled in, he uses St. Elmo’s Fire, sending two pillars of fire through Blackbeard. Blackbeard manages to grab Ace anyways and punches him away, before dealing with his new damage again. His power absorbs the fire pillars away, and Ace realizes that Blackbeard’s power will be more difficult to manage than he expected. Ace fires Cross Fire at Blackbeard and the impact falls a giant rock named Banana Rock which the townspeople observe. The townspeople fear that the ongoing combat may destroy their island in its entirety. Meanwhile, Auger and the rest of the crew are watching from afar, as he comments that unlike other users in combat, Ace isn’t handicapped to only utilizing his Logia abilities.
After some moments, both Blackbeard and Ace are seen in exhaustion, with Ace on his knees while Blackbeard stands tall. Blackbeard once more asks Ace to join his crew, stating that it would be a waste to finish him here. Ace struggles but stands up, stating that if he joined, he can never call himself a man again. Ace says no matter what happens, he won’t submit and live a life of regrets. Blackbeard dismisses his morals, stating that they’re meaningless if he is dead. Blackbeard understands that Ace won’t change his mind, and summons a black pillar towards him. In response, Ace summons a giant fireball at the tip of his finger, the Great Flame Commandment Flame Emperor. Blackbeard remarks that this is the sun facing against darkness and that only one can win. Ace responds that he will make Whitebeard the King, or he will die trying. The two charge at each other with their massive attacks and from afar, the island is seen with their attacks colliding in the center, before the scene shines away into a view of Ace’s hat lying on the ground. The narrator concludes that this clash would set off a chain of events that would change the world.","Marshall D. Teach, Laffitte, Van Augur, Doc Q, Stronger, Jesus Burgess, Portgas D.

Episode 326,Mysterious Party of Pirates! The Sunny and a Dangerous Trap,14-Oct-07,"After departing Water 7, the Straw Hats find a lone ship, badly damaged with no sail and flag. They decide to approach to check if everything is all right. After giving them food and medical treatment, the Straw Hats find out they are imposters, wanting to deliver them out to somebody because of their high total bounty.","As the episode starts, Franky accepts his invitation to the Straw Hat Pirates. Usopp returns to find that the crew's new ship, the Thousand Sunny has already departed. As the crew is being attacked by Marines, Usopp shouts that he wants to go with them. He makes a final proclamation that he is sorry. Usopp admits that he was wrong, and Luffy extends his hand out to bring him back on board. The ship dodges a giant cannon ball throw by Monkey D. Garp using Coup de Burst. Luffy then holds a toast to the two returning members, the new crewmate, and their new ship.
The scene switches to a cabin inside of a ship, where an injured man is having memories about a man named Vigaro. A boy sits and watches over the man, worried about his physical condition. The scene switches again to a large man lying on a couch. He is surrounded by hanging pirate flags, and a group of people addressing him as ""Papa"" arrives, asking him if he is staring at his flag collection again. One of the men from the group tells him that they are throwing a wonderful birthday party for him. We then see the boy again, looking concerned about the sick man, when someone else walks into the room. The man addresses the boy as Jiro and says that he will watch the sick man now.
The scene now transfers to the Thousand Sunny, where the crew is enjoying their new ship. Nami is sitting in a large bath tub, Chopper is spinning in his new doctor's chair and talking to himself as Sanji watches through the window. Luffy catches a large shark and Usopp tells him to put it in the fish tank. In the room below the deck, Robin, Franky, and Sanji watch the fish tank and talk about how wonderful the ship is. Luffy and Usopp run to the fish tank, only to find that the shark has eaten all of the other fish. Zoro is sitting in the watchtower on the ship and yawns. Everyone in the fish tank room sits as Franky explains how the ship's Docking System works.
Nami comes out of the bathroom and goes outside to discover that the crew will soon be coming across a winter island.
The crew soon notices that it is beginning to snow. Zoro looks out the window to see what looks like an abandoned ship. They all comment on how it is strange since it is missing its masts. They see people fishing. Sanji turns the Sunny to travel toward the other's ship. The largest man who is fishing says they won't catch anything without bait. A smaller man says not to say that and be pessimistic. A round man says there isn't anything better to do and looks up to find the Sunny approaching their ship.
The three men are shocked, and Luffy asks if they are alright, only for them to begin shouting to the rest of the crew that pirates have arrived. A few crew members surface from within the ship, including Jiro. The three men who were fishing then beg the Straw Hat Pirates for their lives, leaving the Straw Hat crew confused. They then board the ship and ask the mast-less crew about their condition. The short man who was fishing earlier says that they are a group of fishermen who were attacked three days ago by pirates and begins to cry. The round man comments and says that the Straw Hat Pirates would have nothing to take if they were there to pillage.
Luffy offers them to come aboard the ship and get a meal. Sanji recommends that Chopper should tend to the crew wounds, which he agrees on. The short man from earlier is shocked that Chopper can talk, which angers the reindeer. Chopper then tends to their wounds and one of the men cringes a lot from the treatment. The man who spoke to Jiro at the beginning of the episode walks out of the cabin of his ship to see the Straw Hat Pirates' flag and receives a Den Den Mushi call from a man wearing frilled clothing who asks about what they have found. The first man says that they have come across a rookie ship, which the frilled-clothes wearing man identifies as the Straw Hat Pirates. The man receiving the call is shocked by the number, and the caller tells him to not let them get away.
The scene switches to inside the Thousand Sunny's dining room, where the Straw Hats and the ""fishermen"" are feasting. The ""fishermen"" are very grateful and thank Sanji. The large and smaller ones point out how beautiful Nami and Robin are. Then, Chopper is seen putting away his medical equipment after treating Jiro when the boy asks if he can treat one more person in their ship's cabin. Luffy, back in the kitchen, tells the ""fishermen"" that they are planning on going to the New World, which terrifies the first two fishermen. The rest of the crew seems annoyed with them and equally as scared of the New World. The man who received the call earlier boards the Sunny and gives the crew a barrel of alcohol, introducing himself as Stansen. He throws the barrel to Zoro and says it is special that they have had. The ""fishermen"" inside the dining room and sit and look tense, and one of them pulls out a vile of poison from his pocket.
The scene changes to Jiro and Chopper entering Jiro's ship looking at the sick man. Chopper is shocked by the man's wounds and says he must operate immediately. Back in the dining room, the Straw Hats mention how peculiar it is to have a lot of alcohol and no food, for Stansen to respond by thanking them for the wonderful meal. Luffy offers Stansen to take them back to their island, which Nami disapproves of. The Sunny then is seen towing the ""fishermen's"" ship, with Robin looking out the window suspiciously. Chopper has finished the operation in the other ship's cabin and tells Jiro that they can't relax until the wound heals.
The Straw Hat Pirates are shown having fallen asleep on their ship. The fishermen are discussing their plan, with the large and smaller men feeling guilty due to the crew's kindness. One of the other men says they have no choice when Stansen says they will proceed with the mission. The man yells at Stansen, saying that a counterattack would be what Vigaro would want. They are interrupted by Franky, Sanji, and Robin revealing that they knew about the poison and want to know the truth. Zoro looks out the dining room window and says three people will be enough before going back to sleep.
The scene switches back to the large man on the couch as the clock strike midnight. Everyone in the room begins celebrating the large man's birthday as one of the party-goers receives a call from the frilled-clothing wearing man, who tells him about the Straw Hat Pirates large bounty. The man is pleased and says it will be fitting for today before hanging up on the caller. The last scene is a shot of the Thousand Sunny towing the other ship.","Vigaro (flashback), Puzzle, Jiro, Accino, Campacino, Brindo, Lil, Hockera, Arbell, Salchow, Stansen, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Usopp, Monkey D.

The Mysterious Skeleton Floating Through the Fog,6-Jan-08,"After the Straw Hat Pirates get into some hijinks involving octopus hunting, they discover a barrel in the middle of the ocean. When they open it, it starts up a massive red flare in the sky. The Thousand Sunny gets then thrown into the foggy Florian Triangle where it encounters a ruined ship. Luffy, Sanji, and Nami go aboard the ship to investigate. There they meet a living skeleton man, whom Luffy immediately asks to join the crew.","Zoro is in the observation room of the Thousand Sunny. Looking out of the window, he sees something floating on the ocean and alerts the crew. As the others look out, they see it's a barrel and Usopp notes it has the character for ""treasure"" written on it. They pull it out of the water. Nami step outside and says it probably just has alcohol and food in it. She notes the whole message on the barrel says ""Gift to the God of the Sea"" and that this is a tradition for people to place those kinds of items in a barrel to pray for a safe journey. After some disappointment and discussion, they decide to open it anyway and drink up the booze.
When they open the barrel, a large red light shoots up and explodes in the sky. The crew is a little shocked. They wonder what it means that there was a flare in the barrel and Robin wonders if it is a mere prank or something more serious. Usopp worry that this was a trap and Robin notes they could be targeted by someone.
At that point, Nami notices changes in the atmosphere and senses a storm coming. She urges everyone to get in position to fight it as they only have five minutes. After some difficulties because of the strength of the storm, Franky uses Channel Zero of the Soldier Dock System and gets them out of the storm.
Zoro notes how dark it has gotten even though it is not nighttime and Luffy mentions they are in the ""ghost sea"", the Florian Triangle, that Kokoro told them about. At that moment, they start hearing a haunting song sung in the distance while a massive black ship with torn sails slowly approaches them. The crew is stunned and terrified to see the ""ghost ship"" once they notice it. As the ship passes by the Thousand Sunny, they see a skeleton wearing a suit and an afro and drinking a cup of tea singing softly and watching them. Luffy is excited and wants to rush and see from up close the living skeleton of the legend. Sanji stops him and says he can't go alone or he will find a way to act rashly and get them in trouble. The crew draws straws and Nami and Sanji go with their captain.
Once on the ship, Sanji and Luffy stare in amazement at the skeleton. The skeleton calmly apologizes for not greeting them properly but explains he was so surprised to see real people: all he has seen for years were terrifying ghost ships. He suggests they go inside and talk. He notices Nami and suavely notes how pretty she is. He tidies himself up and matter-of-factly asks if Nami can show him her panties, but the girl decks him. To Sanji's irritation, Luffy wants to know if the skeleton can poop but Sanji insists there are more important questions: who is he and how come he is alive and can talk. Luffy interrupts because he has an even more important question. Luffy offers the skeleton to join his crew and he accepts.","Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 338,"The Delight of Having Met People!
The Gentleman Skeleton's True Colors",13-Jan-08,"Onboard the Thousand Sunny, Brook tells his story of being a musician before being killed. However, his spirit was able to reanimate his skeleton due to the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. He also tells of having his shadow stolen, and thus cannot be out in open sunlight. A ghost suddenly appears in the galley, and the Straw Hat Pirates find out that they have been targeted by the ghost isle Thriller Bark, which has found them.","Brook is aboard the Thousand Sunny, greeting everyone, refers to himself as ""Just Dead Bones"" Brook. Chopper is seen with a cross. Brook approaches Robin, commending her beauty, asks if he could see her panties. Nami comically hits him calling him a perverted skeleton. Usopp gathers exorcism materials and began an attempt to exorcise an evil spirit - Brook. Brook inquired where the evil spirit was and Usopp and Chopper comically answered, saying it was Brook. While in the ship, Brook mentioned he has not had food to eat in so long and requested milk to drink. Luffy, called him ""Korobokle"" and Brook corrected him. Brook inquired what Luffy's name was and he was told. Then Luffy asked Brook what he was and Zoro comically asked why they did not ask those questions when they first met. Sanji prepared dinner, which they all heartily enjoyed.
After dinner, Brook told the crew he was a Devil Fruit user of Yomi Yomi no Mi. Brook told them he had died once, years past and the Yomi Yomi No Mi grants its user the ability to be resurrected. He told them he was once a pirate like them (which excited Luffy) and he was aboard the ship they found him on. He went on telling them his crew came to the Sea of Devils but were defeated by a stronger pirate crew, killing his crew mates and himself. While he was alive, Brook explained to them that he just simply could not swim. However, after death, his soul returned from the underworld. His soul was unable to find his body on time due to the fog that makes that part of the sea difficult to navigate. It took one year for his soul to find his body and by then, he had decomposed to bones. Zoro asked how Brook still has his hair, and Brook responded saying he has tough roots.
Usopp asked if Brook was a human or ghost and Brook responded that he was scared of ghosts. On hearing that, Nami brought out a mirror so as to show Brook how he looked. Brook was very scared at seeing the mirror. That was when Usopp and Chopper realized that Brook had no reflection and shadow. They referred to him as a vampire and the crew was ready to attack except Luffy, who thought Brook was awesome. Brook told them, him being a skeleton and having no shadow are unrelated. He told them he cannot live or see the sunlight because his shadow is stolen. Robin asks what would happen if Brook saw the sunlight and he answered that he would disintegrate. He then told them of an incident he witnessed when a person who had no shadow comes in contact with sunlight.
Brook, yet after telling his story was still delighted. He told the crew of how he had aimlessly traveled that sea lonely and scared and waiting to die, however, he lived on. He told them they were his joy. Brook, at that point, refused Luffy's offer to join his crew, saying if he left the covers of the fog, it would be a matter of time before he disintegrates. He told them he would wait until he gets his shadow back. Luffy was upset at Brook's statement and told Brook, if Brook needed his shadow, he would get it back for him. Luffy, demanded who the person was but Brook refused to tell him. Then, Brook decided to play music for them stating he was the past crew's musician. Luffy, excited that Brook is a musician, said Brook must join his crew. Just as Brook was about to play a song, he noticed a hollow and yelled ""Ghost"" and a rocking feeling was felt on the ship.
Upon coming out to see what had happened, the crew noticed a huge object on their course. Brook told them it was the back of the gate and told the Straw Hat crew to come look at the back of the ship. Reaching there, they were surprised by what they saw. Brook then asked if they picked up a floating barrel. Luffy had a flashback of picking up a floating barrel, and told Brook they did. Brook told them it was a trap and their ship has been targeted after that incident. Luffy asked why an island was there and Brook responded telling them it is the wandering ghost island - Thriller Bark.","Brook, Monkey D.

Episode 339,One Phenomenon After Another! Disembarking at Thriller Bark,20-Jan-08,"Brook bids farewell to the Straw Hats and leaps overboard, revealing that he can dash across the ocean's surface. Nami, Usopp, and Chopper sail out to explore the island using the Mini Merry II, and encounter a Cerberus. Back on the ship, the remaining crew members are harassed by an invisible creature. After fleeing from the Cerberus, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper encounter Hildon, a vampiric creature who offers to take them to the mansion of Dr. Hogback.","Nami notices that her Log Pose has not reacted to the presence of the island. Brook explains that is because Thriller Bark is an island that drifted from West Blue. As he walks inside and picks up his cane, Brook tells the Straw Hat crew that this is a lucky day because he both met them and now sees one of his dearest wishes finally realized. He opens the door on the other side of the kitchen and jumps in the air on the prow. Sanji remarks on how light he is. Brook then bids farewell to the crew. He urges them to quickly make their way out of the gate away from this island and thanks them for the meal. He suggests fate may make them cross paths again some day. He then jumps off the boat altogether and to the crew's amazement, he runs on the water away from them.
Nami then suggests they follow his advice and sail away as fast as they can but from Luffy's facial expression the others realize he wants to go on the island. Chopper worries about the ghost they saw earlier but Zoro saw it fly towards the island. Robin then points out to the rest of the crew what probably happened earlier when the boat shook. The ""mouth-like"" gate probably enclosed them in a fence wall that runs all around the island. They are trapped. Franky also points out that they are in the middle of the sea which means they can't drop anchor. Nami and Chopper sob they have the ""can't get on this island"" disease but Luffy is ready and raring to go. He has a net and a box to catch a ghost and keep it as a pet! Usopp is appalled and try to dissuade him. Robin also suggests she wants to go and it is decided Luffy, Robin and Franky will go explore the island. Franky suggests they need to use Soldier Dock System Channel 2 to get on the island. He explains the Soldier Dock System system and unveils his ""present"" to the crew: Channel 2 is a steam-powered Mini Merry II that can seat four people. As they will be staying on the Thousand Sunny, Nami, Chopper and Usopp are invited to test run the Mini-Merry first while the others watch from the boat. Everybody is thrilled and excited and Luffy is dying to try it too. As the people still on the boat are talking, Nami is heard screaming in the distance. Sanji runs to the side of the boat but nobody can see anything in the fog.
Suddenly the anchor is dropped without anyone visibly dropping it. Franky notes the gears sound much more worn out than they should be on a brand-new boat. A trapdoor on the lawn deck abruptly opens and everybody is puzzled. There shouldn't be anyone else on the boat. Luffy's face start stretching and as Sanji yells at him to stop goofing around, Luffy protests he isn't doing anything. One of Zoro's katanas is taken out of its scabbard and thrown in the air at Luffy who is on the floor after his face was stretched back. Franky jumps in and kicks Luffy out of the way before he gets injured. Franky yells at Zoro who protests it wasn't him. Everybody realizes that there must be someone else on the boat with them.
Franky speculates the culprit is a ghost or a Devil's Fruit user. Luffy confirms he did feel someone grabbing him and Robin says she heard the growl of a wild beast. Sanji is worried about Nami and decides to jump off the ship to go after the missing members of the crew. However as he jumps, something grabs his leg and starts throwing him around and back on the ship. Franky is shocked the ""ghost"" won't let them leave the ship. Robin starts screaming and is seen pushing back against something that is pushing onto her and we see the signs she is being licked by something. Sanji is furious and runs to protect her but he is tripped by an unseen obstacle. A beast is indeed heard growling.
The sea starts becoming tormented with big waves that Franky speculates must be artificial since they are inside the fence. Everybody is confused what to do and Sanji is worried they are going to be separated from Nami and the others. Franky suggests they use his ""Flying Surprise Pool"" to overcome the waves.
Back on the island, Nami, Chopper and Usopp have fallen down a very deep ditch that is located between the actual island and the sea. She explains they were having too much fun with the Mini-Merry and probably bumped into the embankment that she did not see because of the fog and got thrown into the ditch. Chopper and Usopp are upset and scared that they are on the ghost island. The bottom of the ditch is full of skulls and bones which does not help calm their nerves. Nami hopes her cuteness will help them forgive her for putting them in this predicament. Usopp hopes Luffy will find them there but they debate whether it would be wiser to wait on the bank above instead.
Suddenly a three-headed dog appear in the dark. As the three stranded Straw Hat Pirates are shocked, Chopper realize this must be Cerberus, the guard dog of hell! Nami, Usopp and Chopper start running away, with Cerberus in tow chasing them. Chopper notices that one of the three heads is the head of a fox, not of a dog, which seems to anger Cerberus even more. Everybody is confused where they are and what is going on. As they run they find a large staircase that seems to lead to the island proper.
Upstairs they find themselves in a forest. Usopp uses a Kemuri Boshi to create smoke and once it clears, the Cerberus cannot find them anywhere. The beast starts moving further into the forest while Nami, Usopp and Chopper are  actually hiding up in a tree. Usopp remarks that the beast does not seem to have the developed sense of smell of a normal dog. The three Straw Hat Pirates wonder what to do now. With Cerberus running around, they can't be walking around in the open.
A voice behind them confirms they are in danger. It is a vampire-looking man who is hanging upside down on a tree branch. He introduces himself as Hildon. He says he saw them being chased by Cerberus and followed them secretly to protect them in case of trouble. He says that, as nighttime is falling, the forest is indeed going to become dangerous for them and maybe they should ride his carriage with him back to Doctor Hogback's mansion.
Chopper reacts with shock to hearing Doctor Hogback's name.","Nami, Usopp, Monkey D. Luffy, Brook, Nico Robin, Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Franky, Tony Tony Chopper, Invisible Beast, Cerberus, Hildon",

While immediately hospitable, the doctor starts acting strange after it is mentioned that Brook has arrived on the island. The Thousand Sunny, meanwhile, gets caught in a giant spiderweb.","Usopp, Nami, and Chopper take up Hildon's offer in accompanying them to the mansion while they traverse through the forest via carriage. Inside the carriage, they discuss about the strange creatures in the forest with Hildon telling the three that it is dangerous at night and that the mansion is the best place to wait for the rest of the crew. Chopper excitedly asks if they can really meet Dr. Hogback, a doctor whom he idolizes, and explains to Usopp and Nami who he is, telling them that he is a renowned surgical genius who suddenly disappeared without a trace. While Hildon is telling Chopper that Dr. Hogback is in the mansion, Nami is shocked when she looks through the window and saw a lion with a man's face, and started screaming, scaring Usopp and Chopper as well. Usopp asks what she was screaming about. When she told about the lion he didn't believe her so they looked out the window again only to find many strange creatures, but after blinking the creatures were gone, prompting there to become more scared.
Nami and Usopp wants the carriage to stop and go back but Hildon explains that what they saw were possibly just illusions made by the fog. Chopper is saddened by their decision to go back, but Usopp managed to convince him. When the three made up their mind to go back, Hildon told them to stay put inside while he talks to the carriage driver. However, after a few minutes of waiting, Usopp decides to check on Hildon and ask what's taking so long, only to see that there was no one there and that they are in the middle of a graveyard. The three freaks out and tried to calm themselves, but then zombies started to rise from the earth. The three tried to hide in the carriage but a zombie grabbed Usopp and dragged him out, while other zombies turn over the carriage, forcing Nami and Chopper out. Nami hear Usopp scream and saw him getting bitten by zombies. As Nami try to get to Usopp, she is grabbed by a zombie that suddenly popped up from underneath her, causing here to fall on her knees as the zombie try to bite her while a platoon of zombies surrounds her.
Chopper run towards Usopp in his Heavy Point, helps Usopp and knocks the head of a zombie, but is shocked when the zombie put his head back. Nami screams for help, and Usopp used Hisatsu Kayenboshi to start a fire, startling the zombies making them let go of Nami. They used this to run away from the zombies, with Usopp telling the two that zombies move slow, making running impossible, which got the zombies mad and run after them at a fast pace, shocking the three. However, the zombies soon run out of stamina giving the three pirates a chance to escape.
Meanwhile, on the Thousand Sunny, the rest of the crew tries to steer the ship but the helm is stuck because of the current causing it to run into a gigantic spiderweb, entangling it and making it hard to get out.
Nami, Chopper, and Usopp continue into the forest, eventually arriving at the gate of the mansion. Having no other choice, they decide to go in where they are welcomed by Cindry. She then starts throwing plates at Usopp stating that he cannot enter the mansion while the other two can. Eventually, a man came out and greeted them, saying that they are welcome inside and explains that Cindry was once engaged to a man whom she tested his love for her by breaking his most valuable plates, causing him to abandon her, thus making her negative. He introduces himself as Dr. Hogback. Cindry invited the three inside and locks the door, leaving Hogback outside.
In the dining room, Hogback ask why they came in his mansion. Chopper says he wants to talk to Hogback while Nami and Usopp tells him that they were chased by zombies. Hogback is surprised to see them escape the zombies and tells them that he had no idea what they are, and says that they are the reason why he is living here to study them. Chopper, amazed by Hogback, roots for him and asked for his autograph, which Hogback willingly give. However, when Chopper asked if he can see Hogback's lab to which he angrily stated that he, Chopper, will never see his lab. Afterwards, Cindry came back, serving them flans without plates, and telling the three that the bath is ready for them to get clean.

Elsewhere, Hogback meets with Absalom, the invisible man who attacked Nami, and a ghost referred to as Perona, to discuss what to do with the Straw Hats. Back in the manor, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper find themselves surrounded and trapped by the Surprise Zombies: zombies that strike from paintings, taxidermy heads, and even floor rugs.","After the dinner with Dr. Hogback, Nami decides to take a bath with Usopp and Chopper guarding the bathroom door. Chopper states that he wants to take a peek in Hogback's lab while Usopp complains to Nami that if she is scared, she should not take a bath, which she replies that when night falls, they will leave the mansion. The two boys complain saying that they won't make a move for now and that they will wait for Luffy and the others. Nami then says that there are abnormal presences in the mansion as well, scaring the two. She states that she also suspects that Dr. Hogback was lying when he said that he does not have a relationship with the zombies. She heard a growl and voice, thinking it was Usopp or Chopper. Suddenly, invisible hands grab her arms and pins her on the wall. The invisible man continues to growl at Nami, stating that she will be his bride. Usopp and Chopper burst through the door, panicked, when Nami tells them that someone else is in the bathroom with them. Usopp, however, only ends up seeing Nami completely naked and pervertedly thanks her for ""letting"" him see her naked, confusing Chopper. With quick thinking, she kicks her unknown assaulter in the groin, freeing from restraint. Chopper uses his sense of smell to check if he is still there, while Usopp attacks the invisible man, though he escapes. Nami, startled and briefly traumatized from the attack, wraps a towel around her naked body to cover herself. Usopp asks Nami is she is okay, to which she replies that the invisible man knows their plan.
Meanwhile, the Thousand Sunny is immobilized after getting stuck in the spiderweb. Zoro suspects that everything that happened after Nami, Usopp, and Chopper disappeared is a trap, but Luffy insists in exploring the island while searching for Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, prompting Zoro to join them. On their way to the forest, they came across Cerberus, which they scared when they reacted differently than others would have. Luffy tries to tame it but all three heads bites him, making him punch them, thus, taming it. The crew continue their search for the three. In the forest, they encounter two strange creatures: a talking tree and a unicorn. Franky and Luffy run after them, and eventually catches, making Luffy ask the two to join their crew, which Zoro and Sanji objects.
Outside the mansion, Hogback and the invisible man, Absalom, talk with Absalom saying that he will make Nami his bride, but Hogback refuses to hand her because of her bounty. Then a ghost came saying that all the crew members have bounties on their head. Hogback says to Absalom that he needs to go all out in order to capture Luffy, because of his 300,000,000 bounty.
Inside, Usopp argues with Nami in the hallway about the invisible man in the bathroom. Usopp continues to state that zombies and other abnormal phenomenons that occurred were not real, with the exception of Brook because of his devil fruit. He asks Chopper for support by saying that aside from Brook's power, there is no other way to resurrect the dead. Chopper says that in a medical point of view there may be a natural explanation on this, but since Hogback threw his glory for his research, Chopper believes that there may be miracles on the island. Nami tries to tell Chopper that he trusts Hogback too much, but Chopper defends him and ask the two proof that Hogback has a connection to those zombies. Nami argues that it is obvious, even calling Hogback the ""King of Zombies"". Usopp stop the two from arguing further, and Chopper went ahead to talk to Hogback to clear things out, with Usopp and Nami following.
They arrive in the dining room but it is pitch black, and that no one was there. Suddenly, the light went on, and they saw Hildon hanging upside down.

Meanwhile in Hogback's lab, Nami learns the truth about how Hogback was making the zombies. She also tells of how Cindry died ten years prior. Having been found out, Hogback orders Cindry and Ryuma to kill the group. Ryuma then walks into the lab laughing like Brook and admiring Nami even without his eyes. He almost gets to glare at Nami's panties but is denied. The navigator begins to wonder about Brook's personality being replicated by the samurai. Ryuma was once from the kingdom of Wano. The skeletal samurai dashes through with nothing happening at first and asks for a sandwich from Cindry. The group almost makes it out, but Ryuma's power knocks the three down. Ryuma then says he used the Three-Verse Humming: Arrow Notch Slash.
The zombie soldiers continue their march while Luffy's inspecting the mansion grounds while searching for Moria. He and his party find an empty room full of seemingly harmless portraits. Just then, Buhichuck, the living Bear Rug and the portrait zombies begin their surprise attack. Luffy begins to smile while Sanji interrogates the portrait monsters. Robin also uses the twist on some of the portrait zombies and Franky breaks another's spear using his brute strength. Zoro also uses Nigiri to cut through some portrait zombies too and Luffy leads the Bear Rug zombie on a wild goose chase ending with the Straw Hat using the Gum-Gum Bazooka to knock the bear down. Buhichuck is in shock seeing his allies beaten.
Meanwhile in Hogback's lab, Nami, Usopp and Chopper are trapped in a coffin to be disposed of. The soldiers trek through and eventually reach Moria's mansion. Buhichuck then tries to make an excuse that three of Luffy's crew are sleeping upstairs, but Franky notices Sanji had disappeared. Zoro begins to fear for the worst, and Luffy is confident that their cook can survive. Robin insists on taking the mounted pig as a guide while the portrait zombies are laughing and insist they go with them. The zombies warn that when they fight Moria, they will be wiped out one-by-one. Luffy then warns if any harm comes to his crew, he'll beat Moria so hard it would take Thriller Bark apart. As they take Buhichuck as a guide and the pig warns the Surprise Zombies are downed. The orb the zombie soldiers brought in was a disco ball and they sing a massive song to begin their Night Raid. Absalom heads into a casket room and awakes the General Zombies out of their coffins and out of the ground. Nami, Usopp, and Chopper's coffin is then ferried out of the mansion. Absalom concludes his speech to teach the Straw Hat pirates the meaning of fear.","Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Hogback, Victoria Cindry, Ryuma, Brook (flashback), Monkey D.

Episode 349,Luffy in an Emergency! The Living Place of the Strongest Shadow!,30-Mar-08,"After defeating Tararan and releasing his shadow soul from within, Brook explains to Nico Robin and Franky the truth regarding the zombies of Thriller Bark, particularly of the manipulations of Warlord Gecko Moria and his using the Kage Kage no Mi to steal shadows for his zombie army. Meanwhile, Moria meets with the rest of the Mysterious Four (as well as the hidden Straw Hat Pirates in Kumashi) where he uses his powers to steal Luffy's shadow, which he plans to use for his ultimate Special Zombie.","Tararan is in genuine pain, much to the shock of Robin and the spider mice. Franky warns Brook that Tararan is a zombie and therefore won’t be defeated by a simple cutting move. Brook confidently tells him that the spider-monkey is, indeed finished, since zombies actually have a weakness that Brook has identified. Tararan's agony becomes more violent and a black substance flies out of his mouth towards the sky. Brook explains that it is his soul returning to its ""master"". Tararan collapses and loses consciousness. The spider mice are shocked and upset. Franky wants to know what happened and Brook states this was ""purification"".
The spider mice suddenly recognize Brook as the ""Humming Brook"" who caused a ruckus on the island five years ago. They rush inside to inform Moria about it. Brook tells Franky that while the spider web is immune to brute force, it can be destroyed by fire which, sure enough, Franky illustrates with his fire breath. Once free, Franky and Robin confronts Brook about his knowledge of the island. Brook is concerned about the members of the Straw Hat crew that have already been captured and whether it is too late for them. After a bit of goofing around, Franky finally gets Brook to tell them what he knows.
Brook tells them of spending the years after his ""death"" drifting on the sea on a ship with a broken rudder. Five years ago though, he was led to Thriller Bark. Hoping to find a way to repair his ship and finally escape the Florian Triangle, he went in to investigate. He found the zombies and ended up being captured. He was brought to the building they currently stand in front of. There he saw a combat dancer and a patched corpse (called a ""marionette""). Then a huge man, Moria, tore the dancer's shadow from the floor and inserted it into the corpse who then suddenly came to life, replicating the moves of the dancer, while the dancer himself lost consciousness. Soon thereafter, the same thing happened to Brook himself.
Brook explains that a shadow is a replicate soul that follows you everywhere. Gecko Moria, thanks to his Kage Kage no Mi, seizes them and makes them obey his will. He uses a corpse, usually the corpse of legendary warriors, sometimes sown together from different pieces by Doctor Hogback, to transfer the shadow soul into and revive them. It combines the physical strength of the body of the marionette and the personality and fighting skills of the shadowed soul. This is why Moria is particularly eager to find bounty heads to capture. Because of that strength though, the original owners of the shadow are generally sent away and left drifting at sea after they lose consciousness, which worries Franky and Robin. But Brook figures they still have some time before that happens to the captured Straw Hats. Brook has a plan and orders the other two to follow it. Franky is reluctant but Robin asks Brook to tell them what it is.
Inside, Gyoro, Nin, and Bao announce the arrival of the ""Three Mysterious Persons"". Dr Hogback, Perona and Absalom enter the room and stand in front of Moria whose face and gigantic body are finally revealed. He tells them how eager he is to become Pirate King but Luffy, who is tied up with spider web string in a cage in the same room, yells that he will be the one who becomes Pirate King, not Moria!
Luffy yells at Moria to give Zoro, Sanji, Nami and the others back. Dr Hogback admires Luffy’s strength but Perona is skeptical whether Luffy is the type of man who would actually be a threat to the World Government. Luffy and Absalom bicker about the armor Luffy is wearing and ""romance"".
Moria tells Luffy he only captured three members of his crew so far: Luffy himself, Zoro and a ""blonde guy with no wanted poster"". Luffy surmises it must be Sanji. Inside Kumashi, Nami and Chopper are eavesdropping and the three of them are shocked that the three strongest members of the crew got captured. Moria asks Perona about the missing three members and Perona says the Risky Brothers never showed up with them. She assumes they must have escaped. Kumashi approaches to try and tell them about them being hidden inside his body but Perona shushes him again. Absalom tells the others of the fight those three Straw Hats had in Perona’s garden then suddenly worries Hogback did something to ""his bride"" Nami. As they bicker, Cindry interrupts with some putdowns.
Moria interrupts pointing out they can capture the missing pirates later. He wanted them here to show them the creation of Moria's new great fighting asset. Suddenly a scream is heard and Luffy, still tied up with spider web string and in the armor, is crawling around the room. Bao tells Moria that Luffy bit through his cage to escape! Hogback is excited by Luffy's fighting spirit but as Absalom raises his hand to attack, Perona points out that because they are inside, it is better if she takes care of it. Perona starts running after Luffy and Luffy, still crawling, taunts her. But three of the ""negative ghosts"" come out of Perona's body and aim straight for Luffy who can’t crawl fast enough away from them. As they pass through his body, Luffy stops crawling, goes into the fetal position and wishes sadly he was reborn as a sea slug. Absalom notes with a mix of admiration and dread how the negative ghosts were able to destroy the spirit of the ""man who wants to be Pirate King"".
A while later, Luffy is seen without the armor but still tied up in the spider string. This time, he is also hanging to the ceiling with some more string while standing in front of Moria. His spirit is back and he is still grunting and cursing Moria. A large light source is turned on behind Luffy and Moria leans over to grab the shadow Luffy's body is creating on the floor. He picks it up from the floor, dragging Luffy along with it. Nami, Usopp and Chopper, still hidden inside Kumashi, watch in horror. Luffy is shocked and yells at him to stop. Moria pulls out a gigantic pair of scissors and cuts the shadow from Luffy’s body. Luffy falls on the floor and loses consciousness. Moria laughs and celebrates that he now has Luffy's shadow with the 300,000,000 fighting power. He proclaims his intention to use it to create the ""Ultimate Special Zombie"".","Tararan, Brook, Franky, Nico Robin, Cerberus (flashback), Gecko Moria, Hogback, Jigoro (fantasy), Sanji (flashback), Roronoa Zoro (flashback), Monkey D.

The zombie immediately showed his similarity to Luffy, yelling out for food at the moment of awakening! Oars called out for Sanji to make him some food, but was confused by his own sentence, not remembering who Sanji was, the shadow's personality and memories already starting to be worn away. Usopp, Chopper, and Nami are discovered by Moria's band, upon which Nami was abducted by Absalom for marriage and the others were left to fend for themselves against another platoon of zombies until they were saved by Franky and Robin.","Moria walks along the chains to the lifeless Oars being watched by his minions as well as the horrified Straw Hats.

Brook Protects his Afro,4-May-08,"Brook confronts Ryuma, recalling his time on Thriller Bark five years prior - and his first battle with Ryuma and how he lost to a zombie with his own shadow. Ryuma mocks Brook for being so careful about his afro, and the two engage in another battle. Oars meanwhile continues to exhibit traits of Luffy as he devours most of Thriller Bark's food and declares his desire to be the Pirate King.","Brook runs up a flight of stairs, and confronts Ryuma in a room, calmly waiting for him there. Ryuma asks if he knows what giving up means, to which Brook replies he will never give up until he reclaims what he has lost. Ryuma states that he is a legendary dragon slaying swordsman and that the level of their bodies are different, but Brook disagrees, saying that he is his shadow and will fight to return him to his rightful position- under Brook's feet.
Elsewhere, a group of zombies express their shock at people other than ""that humming guy"" knowing about their weakness, stating that despite not being able to die is their catchphrase, it is useless if they are terrified of being destroyed.
Robin, Franky, Usopp and Chopper are running down a flight of stairs, to which the former claims is used to transport stolen shadows. Usopp realizes that the zombies from before were transporting Luffy. He and Chopper worry about Nami, but Usopp says that since her life isn't in danger, they'll definitely go back to save her. Franky replies that that is the exact reason they need to return to the Sunny, wake up the Monster Trio and take back their shadows. Chopper states that it won't be easy due to the amount of zombies, while Usopp asks just how they were able to defeat the group from before. Franky responded, saying that Brook had been the one to tell them of the zombie's weakness, recalling how both he and Robin were given small pouches while Brook explained the vulnerability of zombies to salt. Chopper expresses surprise at the zombies having a weakness, while Usopp realizes that by throwing salt into their mouths, the purification is complete and the shadows are released. Robin asks about the monstrous roar they heard earlier, which Franky says they heard and tracked it, to which Usopp responded that it had been Luffy's voice, and that he and Chopper will explain what they saw later, and that it has become an unbelievable matter.
Meanwhile, hordes of zombies are bringing food to Oars complaining about how the entire island's food supply will be gone at this rate. Many are watching Oars eat in awe, with Moria commenting on his outstanding appetite. Perona is scolding Kumashi for hiding pirates, silencing any attempt for Kumashi to defend himself, as it is ""uncute"". Oars apologizes to Moria as ""leek guy"", saying that even though he didn't even know his own identity, he still forced Moria to feed him; and even if the food is horrible he can't stop eating. The other zombies protest at Oars' rude behavior to their master, but immediately cowered and apologized upon making eye contact with the Special Zombie. Oars complains of his hunger, and that the food he has now is still not enough. Moria calmly replies that he'll give him as much food as he needs, but the zombies claim that there is nearly no more food left in the mansion. Cindry replies that there are emergency rations in the store room of Hogback's mansion, though the latter argues that if they let Oars eat it all then it ruins the point of the food being for emergencies. Nevertheless, Moria orders three zombies to go out and retrieve the food, with many following behind. The food from the storage is brought back, while Cindry watches Oars eating and claims there to be some salted fish in the food as well. The three zombies panic and rush to find it, barely preventing Oars from consuming it. Moria explains to Oars his past life and that now he has been reborn to serve him as an underling. Oars refuses, stating he has a dream, and the place he's in is small and boring, and that he would like to go out for a while, perhaps travel the seas and check out the world. He proceeds to use a Gomu Gomu no Pistol and punches his way out of the freezer, much to the shock and horror of the onlookers. He lands on the ground, and vaguely wonders that for a moment, he thought his arm would stretch, but quickly dismisses the thought to cry out his ambition of becoming the Pirate King.
Ryuma mocks Brook, stating that just like their previous fight, it will end with Brook begging for his life while shouting for Ruma not to touch his afro, But Brook disagrees, stating that this time will be different, recalling when he overheard zombies talk about a comrade who accidentally got purified when he ate some salted grilled fish, and realized that it must be the key to the zombie's weakness. Afterwards he had cornered Hogback and demanded that he be told where the zombie with his shadow was, threatening to spread fish all over the island, only to realize the weakness was in reality salt instead. Later, he came up with the idea to hum music while facing zombies so that he would not get scared and he be able to purify all he came across, so that he would definitely meet the zombie with his shadow one day. The survivors became terrified and begged Absalom to do something about the skeleton who annihilated their comrades. Kumashi tried to warn Perona of the danger, but was immediately silenced and told not to wake her up. Finally, he met Ryuma, and they fought, but Brook was quickly defeated. Ryuma suggested cutting off Brooks afro as a means of making him faster, but Brook quickly demanded the afro be left alone, as if it was cut off, it would never grow back. Ryuma tries to attack, saying that a skeleton who regards an afro to be important is nothing more than a joke, and Brook is forced to defend. Their fight continues, but Brook is again defeated and cornered against a tree. Brook pleads with Ryuma to spare his life, saying that he will never set foot on the island again, and Ryuma relents, saying that if Brook died, he would be in trouble as well. Back in the present Ryuma states he does not want to see such a pitiful scene twice, Brook responding that he can say whatever he pleases, and the two swordsmen begin fighting. Brook proclaims while fighting that during the previous five years, for his second chance, he has gotten stronger.
Absalom brings Nami to a room with an old zombie and two painting zombies, and asks if the ceremony preparations are complete. The old zombie replies that they are ready when Absalom is ready, and one of the paintings comments on the bride's beauty. Absalom orders the ceremony be started immediately, and for Nami to be put in a dress and brought to the ceremonial hall. The old zombie answers that it shall be done right away.","Brook, Ryuma, Nico Robin, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Franky, Oars, Gecko Moria, Perona, Kumashi, Victoria Cindry, Hogback, Gyoro, Nin, and Bao, Absalom, Nami (K.O.)",

They return to the Sunny to find the zombies had ransacked the ship in the process of returning their victims. Usopp finds the missing crewmates in the dining room in assorted humiliating poses. As Brook noted, they're unconscious and unresponsive until Usopp yells, There's a beautiful swordswoman with lots of meat. This awakens all three.
Back in the castle, Nami lays unconscious on a table while a zombie sizes her for a wedding dress. The zombie returns with the dress and lays it beside Nami to check. He also notes the presence of Absalom in spite of his Suke Suke no Mi, forcing Absalom to leave in frustration. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji quickly regain their bearings. The crew trade information they've picked up: Nami's kidnapping, the zombies that hold the stolen crew's shadows, Brook's knowledge of the zombies and how to purify them, and the fact Moria's one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Franky then admits that, in a callous moment, he'd asked what kept Brook going in spite of the hardship he'd endured. Brook then mentioned Laboon, whom he'd been forced to leave behind at Twin Cape but not before promising to return for him.

She detonates it, but the explosion gets sucked into the Impact Dial, which Usopp cleverly brought out. He uses this on a Zombie-Hippo which was sneaking up, breaking his arm, but he then reveals that he stuck Perona's arm to the wall; he makes her faint and therefore wins the battle by first firing hundreds of little moving fake cockroaches onto her, and then smacking her over the head with an inflatable ten-ton hammer.","Usopp sees how Perona can float and go straight through people, and learns that she is a ghost that left a physical body behind.

She seems to succeed in knocking out Chopper with a stack of plates.
Chopper then tries to reason with Cindry, and warns about what her family would've said about the situation they are in. To be alive, one needs to be a free person. Hearing that, Cindry drops and is almost fed some salt. Inuppe stops them with a kick and Jigoro launches a 108 Caliber Phoenix that the parties manage to dodge. Robin the uses a Doce Fleur but is deflected.
Inuppe and Jigoro begin to argue using part of Sanji and Zoro's personalities. With this distraction, Robin binds Hogback's mouth and knows how the zombies won't take orders if his mouth is shut. She releases him and believes he can kill them by dropping them out of the tower. He then orders Jigoro and Inuppe to jump out of the tower, and suddenly becomes horrified that the two have fallen. Hogback cries over his error.
Chopper then prepares to pummel the mad doctor, and Cindry begins to cry over without moving.
Just then, Oars arrives at Moria and Luffy's location and Moria introduces his prized creation to his enemy.","Hogback, Jigoro, Inuppe, Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, Victoria Cindry, Usopp (flashback), Nami (flashback), Perona (flashback), Absalom (flashback), Gecko Moria, Monkey D. Luffy, Oars",

Elsewhere, Luffy meets up with the Rolling Pirates, whose shadows have been stolen by Moria. They plant shadows into Luffy in order to multiply his fighting strength and grant him new skills, so that he can defeat Moria.","Brook laughs proudly and seems well enough to fight against Oars and Moria. In the process of getting some salt, he had also drank down some milk to heal himself. With the large quantity of salt, Sanji knows they only have one shot to purify Oars and beat Moria before sunrise. Moria then dares his enemies to try to get the shadows back.

Usopp fires an Oil Star and massive Firebird Star to light Oars on fire. Moria tells his giant minion to extinguish the fire as it feels nothing to him.

Lola then orders the Risky Brothers to bring in some shadows. They force a shadow into Luffy who feels convulsions. They also give him a sword that the Straw Hat captain uses with great accuracy.

He then uses a Yaksha Crow to cut at Oars' right arm.
Oars then kicks Zoro into a wall and seemingly kills him, but then Usopp fires the massive salt bag into Oars' mouth. It would seem like Usopp has won. Luffy's shadow seems to resist and fly out. But then, the Doppelman shows it caught the salt before it could be digested. The Doppelman then throws the salt back to Usopp and renders it useless.

Nami and Usopp are shocked at Luffy's new appearance. Now serious, Luffy learns the entire crew has been beaten and prepares to fight next. He blocks Oars' Gomu Gomu no Rifle and says there's only one Luffy before counterattacking. Oars then crashes onto the ground scaring the zombie soldiers away.

Kuma is then ordered to eliminate every last person on Thriller Bark including the Straw Hats. The Straw Hats feel exhausted from the fight with Moria, but Zoro prepares to fight. Nami warns him of the abilities Kuma has like how he seemingly made Perona disappear and can warp in split seconds. Kuma takes off his gloves and warps to the Thriller Bark victims and the Straw Hats. As Lola's crew charges at him, Kuma launches a paw-shaped blast through some of them and causes a massive shockwave against some he didn't touch. He then warps to Zoro and prepares to fight him.","Usopp, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Roronoa Zoro, Nico Robin, Sanji, Monkey D.

Episode 376,Kuma's Nikyu Nikyu Power That Deflects Everything,9-Nov-08,"Zoro attempts to fight Kuma, yet all of his attacks are effortlessly repelled. Kuma reveals that he has eaten the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, which enables him to repel attacks and air at very high speed. He then proves his power by easily shrugging off Sanji's Concasse attack and taking out Franky and Usopp with barely any effort. Finally, he compresses air to form a pressure bomb before delivering an ultimatum: He'll spare everyone if they hand over Luffy, only to be met with defiance. Kuma mentions that it's a shame before detonating Thriller Bark with his Ursus Shock attack.","Bartholomew Kuma towers over everyone. Many of the witnesses there wonder what kind of powers this man could have to cause so much destruction. Lola is upset as she and the rest of the Rolling Pirates had just finished suffering through the nightmare of Gecko Moria, but with Kuma in their midst, it seemed their suffering was far from over. The other members of the Rolling Pirates decide to fight as the Straw Hat Pirates already went through a lot to defeat Moria. Zoro suddenly speaks up saying that Kuma challenged him, intending to take down the Warlord of the Sea himself. Kuma starts to speak rather highly of the Straw Hats and their exploits, and how quickly they rose to infamy. However, Kuma makes it clear that they must still be taken out. At that moment Zoro prepares his swords. Usopp tries to talk Zoro out of it but Zoro doesn't listen, as he intends to fight even if it leads to his demise.
As a first attack, Zoro uses Nitoryu Iai: Rashomon but Kuma quickly moves out of the way. Kuma is suddenly above Zoro and tries to attack him but Zoro manages to dodge at the last second. Zoro comments on how fast Kuma is and Kuma sends another paw-shaped air attack that manages to slightly graze Zoro. Everyone then notices the paw on Kuma's hand as Zoro gets up again. Zoro uses Sanjuroku Pound Ho but Kuma deflects the attack away using his paw, redirecting it near some of the Rolling Pirates. Chopper wonders how Kuma is able to deflect the attack with his bare hands. Zoro then says that he's figured out what Kuma's ability is. Kuma reveals that he ate the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi that allows him to deflect anything. The other Straw Hats question the name and appearance of Kuma's Devil Fruit, particularly Franky who doesn't believe it's a serious devil fruit. Kuma sends an air blast at Franky knocking the cyborg down. Everyone is shocked at how Franky, a cyborg, got knocked down so easily. Robin explains this, saying that Kuma is deflecting the air itself. Kuma calls the technique the Pad Ho as he is able to deflect the air itself into a high-speed, damaging attack.
Kuma now assumes a sumo-like position and fires off multiple air shots known as Tsuppari Pad Ho at Zoro. Zoro manages to evade the attack using Toro Nagashi but, as he connects with his attack on Kuma, Kuma deflects the attack away with his paw pads. Zoro is sent flying backwards and Kuma quickly moves closer to him. Some of the Rolling Pirates comment that Zoro is too worn out from fighting Oars and, as Usopp calls out, Kuma suddenly appears behind Zoro preparing for another attack. Sanji suddenly rushes in and kicks Kuma in the face halting the attack. Zoro angrily tells Sanji not to butt in but notices Sanji falling down after kicking Kuma. Sanji screams in pain as Kuma recognizes him due to his kicking style. Sanji wonders if Kuma's face is made of steel and Usopp fires a Hi no Tori Boshi/Fire Bird Star at Kuma. Kuma simply deflects the attack back at Usopp damaging him. It becomes apparent that the Straw Hats are having quite a lot of trouble fighting the Warlord.
After a bit of silence, Kuma speaks saying how boring it is to fight against the injured Straw Hats. Kuma admits it isn't a fair fight as the Straw Hats already fought against Moria and Oars, but he also says he must follow orders even if he doesn't agree with them. Kuma then suddenly starts to compress a large amount of air into a strange translucent paw-shaped energy ball. Nami notices that Kuma is compressing the massive air mass into a very small area. Robin says he plans on releasing the compressed energy, causing an explosion much like a bomb. After a little while, Kuma appears to have finished, but before he releases the attack, he proposes an alternative. Kuma says he will spare everyone's lives if they hand Luffy over to him. The Straw Hats and the Rolling Pirates all decline the proposal and Kuma releases his attack, Ursus Shock, upon everyone resulting in a massive explosion which results in the destruction of Thriller Bark.","Bartholomew Kuma, Roronoa Zoro, Lola, Usopp, Nami, Franky, Nico Robin, Brook, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Monkey D.

Episode 377,"My Crewmate's Pain is My Pain, Zoro Fights Prepared to Die",16-Nov-08,"Zoro tries to fight for Luffy since he lies helplessly on the ground. Through Zoro's efforts, Kuma offers a deal to him. He tells him that he can take all of Luffy's pain away, but has to implant it in Zoro. Zoro agrees to this deal when Kuma says he could die from all of this pain. Kuma takes all of Luffy's pain away from him, gives a small portion to Zoro, then Zoro jumps into Luffy's pain (bubble).","After the devastating power of Kuma's Ursus Shock, everyone of the Straw Hat Pirates and the Rolling Pirates are knocked out. Kuma then takes this time to try and capture Luffy who is still worn out from his fight with Moria earlier. However, just as Kuma picks up Luffy, he is suddenly attacked by Zoro who slashes at him with Ittoryu Iai: Shishi Sonson. This attack manages to damage Kuma but Zoro is shocked to see cybernetic parts under Kuma. Zoro says he should've known that Kuma is a cyborg like Franky and Kuma fires a laser from his mouth that misses Zoro directly but the shockwave sends him flying.
Zoro is shocked to see that Kuma is able to fire a laser from his mouth and Kuma explains that he is a Pacifista. He continues on saying that a Pacifista is a creation designed to work for the World Government and says that he, himself, was created by the infamous Dr. Vegapunk. Zoro replies saying that Kuma has a major advantage being a Pacifista with Devil Fruit powers. Zoro also says that his body has given up on him but, not wanting to give up his captain's head, offers up his own life to Kuma. Zoro says his bounty may not be as high as Luffy's, but he is willing to give up his dream to become the world's greatest swordsmen in exchange. A surprised Kuma looks on how Zoro is willingly to give up his life and dream to make his captain's dream come true. Suddenly, Sanji gets up and offers up his life instead. However, Zoro, who already made up his mind, knocks Sanji out.
Zoro turns his attention back to Kuma who throws his swords in front of him and asks Kuma to show some honor. Kuma, after thinking for a while, agrees to Zoro's plea, saying that it wouldn't be honorable for him to still attack Luffy. Kuma, picking up Luffy, tells Zoro that he will spare Luffy but not before Zoro takes Luffy's place by experiencing all the pain he has endured during his time on Thriller Bark. Kuma then uses his powers to repel all the pain out of Luffy into a large, red mass of air. Kuma says that Zoro must take all of Luffy's pain if he really does want to take his place saying that the experience will kill Zoro as he is close to death. Kuma sends over a sample to Zoro and Zoro suffers intense pain from that small sample. Zoro falls to the ground but barely manages to make it back to his feet. Zoro then sticks his arms into the giant mass of pain. Kuma then remarks on Dragon having a good son.
Later, the Straw Hats and the Rolling Pirates all regain consciousness. Franky is surprised to see Luffy acting well, who tells the crew that his body feels as good as new. As the other Straw Hats wonder why, Sanji runs off toward Zoro's direction. He reaches Zoro and asks what happened to the Warlord, but notices blood everywhere. Sanji asks Zoro what happened, and Zoro, who is covered head to toe in blood, says that nothing happened.","Bartholomew Kuma, Lola, Risky Brothers, Spoil (K.O.), Franky, Brook, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 378,Promise on a Day Long Ago - The Pirate's Song and a Tiny Whale,23-Nov-08,"Hogback and Absalom escape Thriller Bark with the unconscious Moria and reveal that Blackbeard gained his status as a Warlord by defeating Ace. The next day, the Straw Hats celebrate their victory over Moria, but do not know why Zoro is so badly wounded. Sanji hears the story from the Risky Brothers, but prevents them from telling anyone else, saying it would trouble Luffy greatly to hear that Zoro suffered for his sake, but Robin eavesdrops on the conversation. Luffy tells Brook that Laboon is alive, and he is overjoyed to hear it, and begins to think about the time 50 years ago when he and his pirate crew first met Laboon.","Everyone is happy that their shadows are back, and Nami is really happy with the pile of treasure they find. The crew carries lots of food with them down to the courtyard. While everyone starts enjoying it two men say they saw what happened to Zoro after everyone else, including Sanji, was knocked out. Sanji drags them out and asks what happened. After being told about Zoro risking his life and taking in all of Luffy's pain from their time on Thriller Bark so far, he makes them swear not to tell anyone, especially Luffy since he would get sad at the thought that all the pain, he took for his friends was in one of them. Everyone starts partying, and Luffy tries to feed Zoro, still knocked out from taking all of his pain, some rum, but Chopper won’t let him. Brook plays the piano, and everyone starts partying. Luffy asks once again if Brook wants to join the crew seeing he got his shadow back. Brook declines again, saying that he made a promise to Laboon the whale. Luffy then tells Brook he doesn’t need to worry and that Laboon’s fine.

When the crew headed toward the Grand Line, they had no choice but to leave Laboon behind because the danger the sea would present to a young whale like him, but Laboon followed them over Reverse Mountain anyway.

Episode 380,Binks' Sake - The Song that Connects the Past and Present,7-Dec-08,"Brook continues to tell the tale of the Rumbar Pirates' fateful journey into the Grand Line, and the decision he made at the end of his original life.","About 50 years ago, the Rumbar Pirates left the young Laboon in the care of Crocus at the outlet of Reverse Mountain. Brook, then the crew's musician, promised the whale that they would sail around the world, and return for him.
Some time later, the wreckage of Brook's ship floats aimlessly in the Florian Triangle. Brook, resurrected by his Yomi Yomi no Mi Devil Fruit powers but not before his body decayed into a skeleton, is gathering the remains of the rest of his crew. The last skeleton he stores below deck is that of Mizuta Madaisuki. He places the skulls all in a separate casket. He remembers the earlier day when they had to face a particularly nasty weather, including waterspouts. They regrouped in the galley, where Brook prepared to play his violin to cheer up the crew. Brook scares himself when he passes by a mirror, confirming that he had indeed reanimated his skeleton. He recalls a situation where Yorki punished two crewmembers who had been fighting over a near friendly fire incident during a battle. Yorki punched the crewmember who was almost shot, telling him the pain is a reminder that he's still alive. During one night, Brook wonders how Laboon is doing, and Yorki ribs him for being overly sentimental. They later celebrate a victory over the Marines which earned Yorki another increase in his bounty.
Brook's wandering leads him to the steering wheel. While quietly humming ""Binks' Sake"", he spins the wheel. It shows that the broken rudder is not moving. In another flashback, the crew is shown to be worrying about Yorki's illness. It turns out he contracted an infectious disease at a recent jungle island, and infected ten other crewmembers. The ship's doctor says he does not know this disease, and it may kill the crew if Yorki and the other infected aren't evacuated. They land at the next island, where Yorki orders the able-bodied crewmembers to leave the original ship and get a new one. He and the other ill crewmembers would then try to return to West Blue through the Calm Belt. Brook is the last to leave Yorki's side. Yorki takes Brook's hand, and asks that the ship be sent off to their favorite song.
Ten years after he originally entered the Grand Line, Brook is doing his best to amuse himself. He rolls up and down the deck of the ship, and working on his ""45 degrees"" trick. While sleeping, he dreams that he is back on the ship, with the entire crew back, including Yorki. But when he falls on his face, he's snapped out of his dream, and back into his lonely reality of being stuck as a skeleton on a broken ship in the Florian Triangle. He looks through the broken galley and sees his piano. He remembers a day when he wondered if Yorki made it safely through the Calm Belt. As their journey continues, Brook eventually gets a bounty for himself. Of course, they sing wherever they go, no matter what situation they are in. The scene returns to Thriller Bark in the present day, where Brook is playing for the Thriller Bark Victim's Association and the Straw Hat Pirates.
Brook stops playing, and takes a moment to undo the bandage on his head. He opens his skull, shocking Usopp and Sanji, and pulls out a Tone Dial, setting it on the piano. He says it's very rare, but Luffy says they learned about Dials on Skypiea. Brook says he keeps the Tone Dial in his body at all times, and plans on playing it for Laboon when he finishes his journey. He tells Usopp that the Tone Dial carries a song, a message to Laboon that the crew was happy all the way to the end of their journey. Brook asks if he can play the Tone Dial, and Luffy says he should. Brook reaches for the tone dial.
In another flashback, Brook's ship is ruined. The Rumbar Pirates have been decimated by an unknown enemy in the Florian Triangle. The crew finds that the enemy used poisoned weapons against them; those still alive, won't be for much longer. The crew worries about Laboon, and one crewmember inquires about Brook's Yomi Yomi no Mi powers. Brook says he's never died before, but he suddenly gets an idea. He finds a Tone Dial that the crew had purchased. He suggests that if they're going to die, why not die happy? He says that they should sing one last time, and record it on the Tone Dial. If the Yomi Yomi no Mi works and he is revived, he will find a way to deliver the Tone Dial to Laboon.
As the song is recorded in the past, it is played in the present. Lola gets everyone singing and dancing again. Brook plays the piano to the tune as they hear the Rumbar Pirates sing ""Binks' Sake"". In the present, the crowd gathered at Thriller Bark sings the song. A scene in the past is shown of the Rumbar Pirates playing the song for Laboon, who even chirps along to the song. Another flashback shows Brook singing it alone during his solitude following his revival. As they record it, the Rumbar Pirates die one at a time, but they all sing to their final breath, and die smiling. Brook tearfully counts down the last four in musical terms until he is the last one left. ""What's wrong? Now this is just a quartet... trio... duet... solo. Why? Leaving just the accompaniment..."" But as he plays the piano alone to his own demise, he remembers the original mission of the Rumbar Pirates, to bring joy to children through their music, and the promise he made to Laboon. He has a smile on his face when he finally succumbs and dies.
Back in the present, as he entertains the Straw Hats and Thriller Bark, Brook resolves to finally keep his promise to Laboon and return to him.","Brook, Mizuta Madaisuki (flashback), Yorki (flashback), Franky, Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Sanji, Monkey D.

Episode 381,"A New Crewmate! - The Musician ""Humming Brook""",14-Dec-08,"Brook pledges himself to the Straw Hat Pirates, becoming their ninth member, as the crew settles their affairs at Thriller Bark and continue their journey.","Brook told Monkey D. Luffy that he was truly glad to be alive despite the trials he had experienced since reviving over 50 years before. Brook asked if Luffy's original invitation to join the Straw Hat Pirates was still open, and Luffy accepted him as part of the crew. All the Straw Hat Pirates were shocked by this, except for Roronoa Zoro, who was sleeping, and Nico Robin, who knew Luffy would accept him no matter what, but they nevertheless welcomed him to the crew. Brook fully introduced himself, revealing he is a wanted pirate himself, with a bounty of 33,000,000, though it's highly unlikely the Marines would identify him by his bones.
Two days later, Usopp and Franky made a grave for the dead Rumbar Pirates. Brook is glad that his comrades finally have a resting place, especially since the soil at Thriller Bark is from their native West Blue; the Thousand Sunny wasn't big enough to store their remains anyway. He then spent some time playing the violin, when Zoro arrived. Zoro then planted the broken Yubashiri at the grave and joined Brook in his mourning. Zoro and Brook finally had a chance to get acquainted; Zoro teasingly pitied the skeleton, saying he's now part of a crazy crew.
Eventually, the Straw Hats were ready to depart. Lola told everybody she wished they could party just a little longer. Franky told her that the Thriller Bark Victim's Association can use Brook's ship, on which he repaired the rudder and sails. Lola asked Franky to marry her, but he politely declined, saying he's ""too super"" for such to work out. Lola then gave Nami a Vivre Card, which points the way to her mother, a pirate in the New World.
Luffy took out the piece of paper he received from his brother, Portgas D. Ace, which turned out to also be a Vivre Card. To their surprise, Ace's card was burning and shrinking, a sign that Ace's life was in danger. As Luffy and his crew sail away, three enormous and mysterious figures appeared in the fog, looking over Thriller Bark. The Victims decided to set sail the next day.
Nami asked Luffy if he's alright sailing on knowing Ace might be in danger. Brook said he doesn't mind a detour, while others like Franky expressed interest in taking Brook straight to Laboon. Believing that Ace can get out of trouble on his own, Luffy decided to head onward rather than go to rescue him. He says Ace doesn't like looking weak, and he wanted to meet him in the New World at full strength as a rival. The Straw Hats shared another toast for Brook, since Zoro was asleep during the first one, and take a Coup de Burst for a jump-start to their next adventure.","Brook, Monkey D.

The Straw Hat Pirates manage to rescue Sayo and destroy Spa Island and notice that the X on Lina's father's map pointed to an X-shaped underwater volcano opening beneath the island. Several days later, Sayo and Lina complete the gem and send it to the Straw Hat Pirates, but as candy rain falls on the Sunny, Luffy accidentally loses it.","The Straw Hats realize that Spa Island was just a sham. Doran is revealed to be collaborating with Foxy to get the secret ingredient for the gem. Lina has searched everywhere but can't find any sign of Sayo. She pleads with Luffy to save her sister as he wants to see the gem.
Luffy wishes to wreck Spa Island, much to the crew's protest. Zoro agrees to the plan. Luffy tells Franky to take care of the Sunny, while the crew begin to wreck the island-ship, causing flooding in multiple area and also fighting through Doran's henchmen.
Angered, Doran reveals a massive cannon and shows Sayo tied up on the roof and in the cannon's range. Doran then demonstrates his cannon's firepower leaving Sayo at the greedy owner's mercy. He demands the notebook be handed to him unless Doran executes Sayo. Desperate, Sayo insists on Lina to complete their father's research and make the gem that would save their village.
Lina thinks back on how her father hasn't come home from work. Their father soon arrived to see a cake made for him. He also shows 30-year-old shells that could prove useful in his research. He also ate the cake, but the heat from the sun made it go back, so he collapsed. Their father also told that Lina was determined to hold a birthday party for him. As their father left, he didn't want greedy men to take his work.
Lina and her father once did clover-leaf hunting.
Lina then realizes she very well forgot about her cloverleaf and refuses to surrender the notebook to Doran. Robin uses Seis Fleur to hold the greedy entrepreneur down, then Usopp shoots a Special Tobasco Star to heat up his mouth. Nami and Chopper race to rescue Sayo, but find the lock needs a key. Then, Zoro cuts through the cannon with a Great Buddha Slayer and frees Sayo. Brook relaxes while he is admonished by Usopp.
Desperate, Doran releases the ship's ballast and tries to blast Luffy, but he dodges, goes into Third Gear and bashes a Gigant Axe onto the cannon, defeating the corrupt Doran and splitting Spa Island in two. Porche wakes Foxy up while the Thousand Sunny sales away. Lina then catches Luffy as he tells how he forgot the side effects of Third Gear. While in the water, Lina spots a big X as Sanji carries them out. The X that Rina found is an underwater volcano.
In the sky, a round rainbow forms, leaving the crew astonished. They soon learn the Round-Rainbow is the gem of the sea. Doran swims away from Foxy who is giving chase.
Days later, Nukky flies in using a bird form to give a message from Lina of how they made a special cake and were successful in their experiment. Luffy observes the gem, and a candy rain falls.

First, he goes to help Sanji in the kitchen, but drops the plates. Sanji catches them but has his hands are full. Brook offers to bring Nami a cup of tea, although Sanji wanted to do it himself. As he brings it to Nami, he accidentally spills the tea over the map she was drawing. Disheartened, he goes to see Franky and Usopp who are building a weapon which runs on cola. He offers to help by filling the weapon with cola, but fills it with soy sauce instead, causing the weapon to explode. Chopper, while drying some plants in the sun, finds his work ruined by the soy; Usopp and Franky's work is lost; and Luffy is the only one who seems happy, since the soy makes the meat he's eating taste better. Finally, he goes to Zoro, but only disturbs him in his meditation. In the end, he speaks with Robin. She tells him that he should just be himself, and that he is as much a crew member as the others.","During a particularly calm night, Brook is on watch, manning the steering wheel while reflecting on the peace. He remembers his old companion Laboon, and contemplates his new companions, the Straw Hat Pirates. He recalls discovering a journal recounting the adventures and battles the crew have gone through. He vows that as long as he's their friend, he will act appropriately. The next morning, Brook wakes everyone up by singing Black Handkerchief of Happiness, much to everyone's annoyance.
At breakfast, Brook's laughter grabs everyone's attention and Chopper notices that Brook has read their journal. Brook announces that since he has become their comrade, he does not feel like he has been of any help, but intends to work himself ""to the bone"" to become acceptable.
In the kitchen later on, Brook washes up, while Sanji is preparing tea to serve Nami. Brook slips and drops the dishes, but Sanji manages to catch them with his legs, arms and mouth. Trying to be helpful, Brook decides to deliver Nami's tea, much to Sanji's frustration.
Brook goes to Nami to deliver her tea. As he arrives, she explains that she is catching up on her map drawing in the calm weather. Brook offers to refill her cup of tea, but fails to notice when it overflows until Nami sees it. Brook tries to clean up the map, but only manages to wipe away the ink. He rushes away to escape Nami's wrath.
Luffy calls him over to see a new cola-powered cannon developed by Franky and Usopp. Franky asks Brook to fetch another barrel of cola. Brook gladly complies, but picks up a barrel at random. Usopp and Franky target a nearby rock formation and attempt to fire, but the cannon explodes, showering fluid everywhere. It turns out the barrel Brook fetched was full of soy, not cola. An enraged Franky chases Brook while Chopper, who was drying medicinal plants, finds that they are ruined.
Brook goes up to the crow's nest in order to train with Zoro. Zoro welcomes him, and begins his meditation. Brook tries to join, but continually annoys Zoro until he loses his temper.
Upset, Brook wonders if all he has done is to be an inconvenience to everyone. Robin notices he seems perturbed, and asks what is wrong. After hearing his troubles, she explains that she also felt out of place, but now the crew is her family. They risked their lives to save her at Enies Lobby, and she is prepared to do the same for them. As Brook reflects on her words, Luffy rushes up and tells them that it's time for food.
Later on, Brook sits out on deck, enjoying a cup of tea and then napping. Brook begins to think about how long it has been since he has had an afternoon nap so comfortably. In the Florian Triangle, falling asleep would lead to him dreaming about being with his old crew and Laboon, only to wake up to a lonely and painful reality. But now, he's surrounded by his friends.

Robin, Brook, and Luffy investigate with the Shark Submerge III to see how they could get to Fish-Man Island but are unable to go deep enough to find any clues. A Sea Rabbit attacks them, and after they defeat it, it spits out a mermaid named Camie and her starfish pet, Pappag.","In the Holy Land of Mary Geoise, Kuma appears before Sengoku who demands why he let the Straw Hat pirates go. Garp accepts his grandson's tenacity to the anger of his superior. The older admiral says that no one will believe Luffy's story on how he had beaten Moria. Sengoku knows that because Kuma showed compassion to the Straw Hats, if they follow their log pose continually, they'll reach the Navy Headquarters. Garp then presents some tea that Sengoku rejects.
On the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats begin to feel bored while Luffy, Chopper, Usopp and Brook they are fishing as Zoro and the others have tea. Luffy complains the group hasn't arrived at Fish-Man Island yet while Nami warns they will be closing in. Sanji thinks of mermaids, but then Usopp spots a school of fish. Nami spots that the fish are trying to swim away from something. Just then, the Thousand Sunny finds itself in a seasnake current. The waters form large columns shocking the crew.
Sanji tries to take evasive action for the ship, but it's stuck while the seasnake column drops onto the ship. Zoro cuts through one and gets damp. Franky shoots a Weapons Left at a seasnake and is drenched as well. Luffy launches a Gum-Gum Pistol at another seasnake, getting wet too, while Brook cuts a seasnake and jokes on how the situation is as slippery as a snake. The crew begin to fend off more seasnakes while Nami points even if the ship flies, the seasnakes will just catch them. Brook prepares to play a song, but a seasnake bounces the ship off. Chopper almost falls into the water until he is caught by Robin.
A while later, Nami and the crew spot the entrance to the Red Line. Sanji thinks of the storm the Straw Hats had to navigate through to get to the Grand Line along with the lighthouse. Brook looks back on how it took 50 years for him to get to the Red Line and on his former crew. Spotting a more massive seasnake, Nami advises Sanji to ride the wave. The Thousand Sunny rides along the seasnake and Brook activates the Coup de Burst, flying out of the Seasnake Current.
The manage to see how large the Red Line is, and Luffy tells of the many obstacles the crew had to face. Franky remembers how he ventured into the South Blue through Reverse Mountain, and Robin remembers how she entered the Grand Line through the West Blue. On Luffy's end, he hopes to sail the ship around the world to get to the wall one more time.
Nami warns the crew is dangerously close to Mary Geoise, the home of Navy Headquarters. Chopper and Usopp take a swim while Zoro exercises while thinking of how he barely managed to survive Kuma's assault. Nami checks on Robin, Brook and Luffys progress in the water. The skeleton swordsman reports of a monster in the water and requests to Nami the kind of panties she's wearing but she threatens him.
As Luffy, Robin and Brook use the Shark Submerge III, the water pressure rises from going over 500 feet. Just then, A Sea Rabbit appears out of the darkness and tries to eat the submarine. Sanji presents some tarts made from Thriller Bark. Nami begins to worry about how to get to Fish-Man Island, just as Shark Submerge III emerges. Luffy shows he, Brook and Robin had no luck searching for the island just as the Sea Rabbit strikes again. Luffy uses a Gum Gum Rifle to punch the sea monster, but then it spits out a mermaid and a starfish. The mermaid lands on Sanji while the starfish talks on how he survived. The mermaid shows excitement for the cook saving her, but the starfish insists he go back into the Sea Rabbit's mouth.
The mermaid shows shock at landing hard on a human and apologizes to Sanji who shows love for her. Eventually, the crew surprised to see a mermaid on their ship.","Monkey D.

Episode 386,He Hates The Straw Hat Crew - Iron Masked Duval Makes His Appearance,25-Jan-09,"Camie and Pappag introduce themselves to the Straw Hats, who then later find out that their fish-man friend has been kidnapped by Iron Mask Duval and the Macro Gang. The Straw Hats set out to rescue him and are attacked by Duval's henchmen, the Flying Fish Riders. When they recognize the Straw Hats' flag, they retreat and inform Duval that the man who ruined his life is approaching, and he replies that he cannot wait to have his revenge!","The crew, excluding Robin, are all shocked at the sight of Camie, who is still trying to wake up Sanji after she fell on his head, but in reality he's just in awe at the sight of her as well. But when Camie turns around, she pauses before freaking out at the sight of a bunch of humans. After she calms down, she thanks them for saving her from the Sea King and saying it was the twentieth time she was eaten by one. She says she needs to them in someway and asks to make some Takoyaki, which Luffy says is his favorite. But she says that it'll be 500 Berries per person which surprises the crew and makes Pappag slap and she says she messed up.
Meanwhile, Sanji is still lovesick shouting ""Mermaid"" and stating that it's first time he has seen one. But Usopp says him that it's not the first time he's seen and reminds him of Kokoro, which sickens Sanji stating that Thriller Bark wasn't scary compared to the sight of Granny Kokoro as mermaid. Usopp apologizes, tells him to pretend he didn't say that and that it's the first time he's seen one, which Nami says is rude. Luffy asks if Granny Kokoro was a mermaid and says that she was walking. Franky remembers that Luffy wasn't around as he was fighting Lucci when she revealed that she was a mermaid to save the crew from drowning back in Enies Lobby. Luffy puts on a disgusted face and says that he doesn't want to think of Kokoro as a mermaid, which angers Nami and forces her to punch him, noting that he's too blunt. Brook walks up to Camie and asks her for money and Sanji kicks him hard, but Camie is super scared because he's a skeleton, which enrages Sanji even more. Brook trying to calm her down opens his head, and Sanji kicks him away but Camie is actually entertained by it, which Usopp notes saying that she accepts people quick. Then Luffy asks her if she ""poops"" and Sanji kicks him now. Sanji interrupts her answer and fights with Luffy.
Luffy notices Pappag and grabs him asking Camie what he is, which she answers by saying that he's a starfish, her pet and master. Luffy is confused, Nami asks if starfish talk and Usopp says that it's weird that it's her master. Pappag then sings and plays his guitar but the crew ignores him preferring to talk to Camie, and becomes glum. Luffy asks how he can talk which makes him become excited, which Usopp notes that he got over that quick. Pappag says that he thought he was human before realizing he was a starfish and in the process learned how to talk. He introduces himself as an up and coming designer and thanks them for saving him and Camie. Nami tries to ask how they can get to Fish-Man Island but Luffy yells that takoyaki comes first. Camie says that they'll have to meet up with Hatchan, which she pronounces ""Hatchin"".
Camie calls Hatchan on a transponder snail, but he doesn't answer. Instead it is Macro which freaks out Camie. Camie asks why he has Hatchan's snail, which Macro answers by saying that he beat him up, which Camie tries to deny. Macro says that yes normally they'd lose to Hatchan but this time they teamed up with the Flying Fish Riders. Hatchan is relieved that she survived. She asks if they really did beat him up and he answers that they caught off guard but warns her not to come save him and that he'll wreak havoc and go home. Macro says that he's gonna sell Hatchan, stating that he's worth a fortune since he's an Octopus Fish-Man, which are rare, and goads her into coming to save Hatchan and tells her the location of their of the Riders' hideout, which is in the Sabaody Archipelago. Hatchan repeats not to come but angers Macro and hits him, finally saying bye. Camie becomes a bit down and Sanji sympathizes with her, but Luffy asks where's the takoyaki, which makes Franky and Sanji hit him. Nami then notes his voice sounded familiar, thinking of the possibility that he was the Hatchan from the Arlong Pirates. Camie says that she has to go save Hatchan and that she'll have to give the takoyaki some other time, which bums out Luffy and makes Franky and Sanji him him again. Nami says that they (meaning the others in the crew and not her) will help her save Hatchan in exchange for how to get to Fish-Man Island. Camie verifies if Luffy will help her and he says asks who he actually is, which she replies by saying that he's owner of the takoyaki shop and her boss, noting that it's the best in the world. Luffy becomes excited and orders the crew to save him. Nami asks where he is, Camie pulls out a map and Pappag shows the area. Camie calls a school of fish to show her the way there, which amazes Luffy and Nami. They point the way there and Luffy compliments her skills of talking to fish which makes blush. They head out.
At the Riders' hideout, Macro reports to Duval that he lured her to the base and that the plan is going well. Duval orders a few of his men to go meet her but before they leave, Macro reminds them that she's valuable so not to harm her. Macro then taunts Hatchan before the Rider's head out on their planes.
Back on the Sunny, Luffy introduces Zoro to Camie which reminds him of Kokoro and saying that she's the first one he's seen like Sanji and company which shocks Chopper. Camie worries for Hatchan but Pappag consoles her saying that he's strong. Pappag then asks if they are confident in their skills which Luffy responds by saying that they are strong. He then informs them that there several kidnapping crews in the area and that human trading is a booming business in Sabaody, which Sanji says is a nasty business. Pappag talks about the costs and that mermaids are expensive, explaining why Macro tries to kidnap Camie all the time. Zoro says that hearing ""Hachi"" and octopus reminds him of the ""idiot"" fish-man he fought back in Arlong Park. Sanji says that if it's him, he's not gonna save him. Franky asks who the Flying Fish Riders are, who Pappag says is a very active kidnapping gang in the area and their boss is a guy in an iron mask called Duval, also saying that he is looking for someone and checks every passing ship. Luffy tells Camie not to worry and that he will save the ""takoyaki"" and order Brook to play a song on the way there.
Suddenly the school backs out cause the Riders arrived. Since they're flying in planes, Luffy could not spot them but Camie shows him. They attack the ship and notice that they are the Straw Hats. They go for another bombing run but Zoro and Luffy block the bombs with 72 Pound Cannon and Gomu Gomu no Pistol respectively, while Brook and Chopper cower in fear. The Riders decide to withdraw under Duval's orders.
Back at the Riders' HQ, Duval informs Macro that Camie is on a pirate ship. Duval gets enraged saying that he's been waiting for the Straw Hats and declaring that he'll kill the man who ruined his life.","Nico Robin, Usopp, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 387,The Fated Reunion! Save the Captive Fish-Man,1-Feb-09,"The mysterious Duval gets excited when the crew that rescued Camie turns out to be the Straw Hat Pirates. He claims one of them ruined his life. Shortly afterwards, the crew find out that Camie's friend is Hachi.","After their brief initial run-in with the Flying Fish Riders, the Straw Hat Pirates begin to plan their rescue of Camie's fish-man friend. Luffy is excited over their flying fish. Usopp asks Franky to move the cannons up to the deck so they can shoot down the flying fish. Camie is worried about ""Hacchin"", but Pappag says she should worry about herself, since she's the one the Macro Pirates are after. Back at their compound, Duval tells the Riders that he aborted the attack because he wanted to kill the man that ruined his life himself. He thanks the Macro Pirates for their help; he had no idea that their alliance would hasten his finding the Straw Hats.
Overhearing this freaks out the Macro Pirates' hostage: Hatchan, the octopus Fish-Man that, long before, was a member of the Arlong Pirates. He is distressed that the very pirates that defeated him before are coming to save him now. He knows Nami will be among them, and figures there's no way they'll save him once they find out who he is. As the Thousand Sunny arrives at Duval's compound, they put Hatchan in a cage, despite a last-ditch effort to bribe the Macro Pirates into freeing him with takoyaki. Nami continues to show concern as everyone refers to Camie's friend as ""Hacchin"". When Hatchan sees the ship, and recognizes the crew, he makes one last effort to break out of his cage, before spitting ink all over himself in a thin attempt at a disguise.
Nobody else is around ""Hacchin""'s cage; the Straw Hats are certain he is being used as a trap of some sort. As they approach the inky creature, he begs Camie to turn around, that he'll get free himself and rejoin them somehow. The longer they persist, the more doubt grows among the Straw Hats who fought Arlong. Sanji calls out, asking how Arlong was doing. Hatchan responds that Arlong and the others were captured by the Marines, but he escaped to chase his dream as a takoyaki cook. Luffy recognizes him immediately; Hatchan curses himself for letting it slip.
Usopp explains to the more recent crew members how Arlong ruled over Nami's home island, and Luffy defeated them. Zoro pointedly tells Camie that Hatchan is no friend of theirs. Luffy aborts the rescue, but before they move to leave, he asks how good his takoyaki is. Hatchan understands, figuring this is exactly what would happen, but Camie and Pappag refuse to believe they'd go back on their promise. They jump overboard to rescue him themselves...only to be caught within seconds by the Macro Pirates. Hatchan starts crying, and thrashes about in his cage, trying to get out to save Camie. Seeing his effort, Nami relents and tells the crew to go save Hatchan. She says they promised Camie, and Hatchan is probably harmless to them by now. Luffy agrees, but it's clear he still just wants takoyaki.
Duval relaxes for a moment with his helmet off, and calls his associates on Den Den Mushi, asking if his men's ""preparations"" are complete. Luffy jumps off the ship, using Gomu Gomu no Pistol to grab Camie and Pappag, then uses Hatchan's cage as a stepping stone to get on Duval's compound. Macro is surprised that he's a Devil Fruit user. Luffy orders Zoro to cut Hatchan's cage open, but the octopus warns them that the Flying Fish Riders' trap has been sprung. Duval gives the order, and the Flying Fish Riders rise from the ocean, circling the compound and the Thousand Sunny. Luffy orders his crew to prepare for battle, assuring Camie that they are ready for anything.","Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 388,Tragedy! The Truth Hidden Under Duval's Mask,8-Feb-09,"The Straw Hat Pirates do battle with the Flying Fish Riders and Macro Fish-Man Pirates. The stakes rise when Duval reveals himself, and exactly who his grudge is against: Sanji!","As the Flying Fish Riders make their initial flyovers of the Thousand Sunny, Luffy grabs onto one and throws its driver off, going on a joyride. Sanji easily kicks away the first drop of grenades toward the ship. Nami orders the sails raised, but the battle is almost stopped dead in its tracks when the fish make their first dive to regroup; they can only stay in the air for five minutes at a time. This puts Luffy underwater, and he starts drowning. Chopper and Brook jump after him, and they drown, too. Franky and Nami have to save all three. Nami berates them for the interruption to their battle.
The Macro Pirates rise and go after Camie and Pappag again. At this point, Zoro cuts the cage open, freeing Hatchan to join the fight. Hatchan takes the Fish-Men on, with Tansui being an expert at Fish-Man karate, and Gyaro having developed ""goldfish fencing"". But they're knocked away when Hatchan throws three fists, his ""Takoyaki Punch"", then reunites with his friends. Zoro slashes a fish rider that gets too close to them. Although he apologizes to Zoro for his actions in the fight against Arlong, Zoro reminds him that his Six Sword Style proved no match to his own Three Sword Style back then.
Duval orders his men to engage in ""The Zero Fight"", and offers to reimburse his men for any medical fees incurred from the dangerous battle plan. One of the men goes in for a kamikaze attack. Sanji kicks the man off, while Luffy stops the fish with Gomu Gomu no Fusen and takes it on the ship for dinner. He then determines to ride one again, though Nami says she won't save him if he drowns again. Brook gets down on himself, since drowning was the first thing he did in battle for the Straw Hats. He jumps in the air, unsheathing his sword from his cane, and plays ""Lullaby Song"" on his violin, putting several fish riders—as well as Luffy and Chopper—to sleep. He then gets in the water, using his extremely light weight in combination with his superhuman strength to run on the water and slash several of the fish. Luffy grabs one of the fish whose driver was put to sleep, and crashes right into Duval's hut. Duval puts his helmet on, and turns to greet the shocked captain.
Back outside, Zoro is already winded, still not 100% after his run-in with Bartholomew Kuma on Thriller Bark. Brook slashes some more fish, then tires and jumps onto the compound by Zoro and Hatchan. They get ambushed by a fish rider, who Hatchan slashes with Six Sword Style Takoashi Kiken. Zoro and Brook returned the favor shortly after. As the fish riders get in formation, Franky is confused by their words, thinking they're calling for him. Nami and Robin continue the fight on the ship, with Chopper using a Rumble Ball get to Arm Point. Franky stops one that shot at him with Strong Hammer.
Luffy runs through Duval's compound, and is chased out by his spear cannon and his bison, Motobaro. They run out, with Duval mad that his men are getting mowed down so easily. He runs Hatchan and Camie off, saying he didn't enter the slave trade for the money. It was part of his plan to exact revenge on one man: Sanji. At first, Sanji has no idea why Duval would be angry at him. He thinks it might be something from his time on the Baratie, but Duval says it's quite recent, further dumbfounding the chef. The spears are poisoned with scorpion venom; any hit will result in death in three minutes.
Luffy tells Zoro that he's seen what's under Duval's mask, and Zoro will recognize him, too. He moves in, and kicks off Duval's mask. Everyone sees why Duval is so angry: his face looks exactly like the composite sketch drawn for Sanji's wanted poster. As a result, he's been pursued by the Marines and bounty hunters in Sanji's place. This idea infuriates Sanji greatly.","Monkey D.

Episode 389,"Explosion! The Sunny's Super-Secret Weapon, Gaon Cannon",15-Feb-09,"Duval reveals that he was once a small-time bandit until Sanji's wanted poster came to light. Since then he hid his face with the iron mask until he could get revenge on Sanji. He then uses steel nets to nearly drown Sanji, until Camie saves him. Meanwhile, the Flying Fish Riders attempt to crush the Thousand Sunny, but with the newly installed Gaon Cannon, they were quickly defeated. Duval, in his anger, decides to run over Luffy with his bull, but to everyone's surprise Luffy easily stops the bull without even attacking it, by unknowingly using Haki. Sanji then comes on shore and deals the final barrage of kicks.","With Duval's face revealed, the Straw Hats are in awe as it looks like Sanji's wanted poster. Duval blames Sanji for everything that happened to him years ago. He also tells of how bounty hunters came after him at the behest of the Marines. As Sanji makes it where Luffy is, the Flying Fish leader tells his enemy that he had to hide all his life. As he demands his life back, Sanji kicks Duval squarely in the face. Then, Duval and Sanji argue about the face on the wanted poster. The rest of the Straw Hats believe Sanji is lucky while Franky is thinking of making friends with Duval. The cook then yells that Duval should've shaved before hunting him down. Duval explains that he and his gang wanted a casual lifestyle. They were only petty bandits making a living.
One of his gang members scolded a girl for spilling ice cream, and threatened her father. As their reign carried on, the Marines put out a bounty for Sanji forcing the town to clear out. At first, Duval thought the villagers would both fear and respect him, but the Marines reached him, thinking the bandit to be Black Leg Sanji. Surprised, Duval tried to tell the Marines otherwise. Ruined, he had traveled with his gang and got his back severely injured. Duval became determined to chase Sanji to hell. Sanji grips the Flying Fish leader for putting Nami and Robin in harms way. Duval then tries to shoot his Scorpion Harpoons, but the cook dodges. Duval then orders a trap formation. As the Flying Fish Riders close in, Sanji kicks a rider, but is struck by a steel net and pulled underwater.
Luffy tries to save Sanji, but Zoro reminds him of his Devil Fruit abilities, so Hatchan has to race to the rescue. Duval points out the speed of the Flying Fish as they can use oxygen tanks ensuring that Sanji will drown. Eventually, Sanji passes out. Then, Camie dives into the water after Sanji. Pappag then says that even if the Flying Fish Riders and Fish-Men are fast underwater, mermaids are much faster than them. Luffy then wishes the mermaid luck. Then, the Flying Fish Riders bring up a large anchor to drop onto the Thousand Sunny. Franky heads to the wheel and announces there was a secret weapon installed just as the Flying Fish Riders drop the anchor. Just as the anchor hits, Franky activates the Chicken Voyage, taking evasive maneuvers. Usopp then heads to the bow and finds some controls with a weapon stored. Duval is horrified to see the head of the Sunny opening, revealing a cannon. With the weapon aimed at the hideout, the Gaon Cannon is fired, hitting the hideout badly.
The Flying Fish Riders are beaten and Duval looks on in horror. Franky then explains how it uses an amount of cola. Just then, the net gets tangled and Camie carries Sanji back to the surface. But Sanji has a nosebleed because Camie had pressed his face in her breasts while rescuing him. Now angry, Duval charges at Luffy using Motobaro, but is countered. Motobaro shakes in fear and passes out. Robin begins to think Luffy won the animal over. Sanji then steps up claiming Duval is a freak. Angry at how the wanted poster came out, Sanji then begins to bombard Duval's face with a series of kicks. He then finishes with a Parage Shot and kicks the Flying Fish leader into another building. Sanji then concludes that he gave Duval a full course free of charge.","Hatchan, Pappag, Camie, Roronoa Zoro, Brook, Monkey D.

Duval shows up again, not for revenge, but to thank Sanji since his kicks altered Duval's face to become handsome and suave, or so he thinks. To make up for the trouble he's caused, he leaves his Den Den Mushi number with the Straw Hats in case they may need his assistance before departing with the newly christened Rosy Life Riders. The Thousand Sunny sets sail for the Sabaody Archipelago, the stepping stone to Fish-Man Island. Hatchan explains that one needs to have their ship coated with a bubble resin in order to travel underwater, and once they reach Sabaody, he promises to find them a ship coater that he trusts. He also warns them that the World Nobles will be on the island, and no matter what happens, not to touch them, even if they witness a murder.","After the victory of the Flying Fish Riders, the gang searches for Duval. They find him unconscious under the rubble of a building. Duval wakes up covering his face. The gang shows a mirror and then, Duval sees his new face in shock.
Meanwhile, Luffy gorges on Hatchan's takoyaki on his Takoyaki 8 vendor ship. The crew enjoy the food that Hatchan prepared for them. Camie also presents some rice cakes and miso. Nami seems to have trouble tasting the food and threatens Hatchan. However, she finds the rice cakes tasty.
As they continue their tastes, Duval and his gang arrive, but the leader wants to thank Sanji for rearranging his face. He now has a handsome face and wants a rosy life. Before departing, Duval hopes the crew will ask if they have any troubles. Sanji orders him to leave believing he'll be happy. Duval then becomes infatuated with Nami thinking she blew him a kiss, but she was wiping sauce off her lips.
Usopp calls Duval an idiot, but then the former Flying Fish leader presents his number and declares his gang the Rosy Life Riders.
With the crew stuffed and Hatchan tired, Camie cleans up with everyone satisfied. As Brook passes gas, Nami punches him in a rage.
Over some tea, Camie then points out the crew needs to get to Sabaody Archipelago. Normally, the water pressure would crush submarines. Pappag announces he would enlighten the group about the ocean. There are two routes to get to the New World; One route allows Marine Ships through Marie Jois without trouble but will deny pirates passage. Another passage is the ocean floor passage that goes through Fish-Man Island.
Chopper seems to have second thoughts, but as the Thousand Sunny is not equipped to go underwater, Camie hopes to get the equipment for the ship.
At the bottom of the Red Line is a big hole that will lead to Fish-Man Island about 10,000 meters underwater. Camie also points out the ship needs a coating.
Just then, the Thousand Sunny arrives at the Sabaody Archipelago with bubbles floating about.
Luffy becomes excited to see the bubbles. Camie points out the bubbles float out of the ground. Hatchan then explains the mangrove trees as they stick to the water and home to the Hustle Muscle Mangroves. There is also a set of towns on the archipelago and numbers mark the trees. Bridges connect the islands.
The ship arrives at Grove 41 and Luffy gets off first. A bubble comes up and Luffy jumps onto them. Robin sees how the ground is sticky.
Luffy then sees an amusement park called Sabaody Park with a ferris wheel that Camie is obsessed with, but Pappag denies her. Suddenly, the bubbles pop and drop Luffy to the ground hard but he then gets his head out.
Hatchan then explains they need to find a coating specialist so they can coat the Thousand Sunny. He also trusts an expert ship coater and hopes to find him, but also warns of the World Nobles.

Usopp and Franky stay behind to make repairs to the ship, and Sanji stays as well in order to guard the treasure for Nami. Hatchan tells the Straw Hats that the World Nobles are also known as the Celestial Dragons and that they wear masks so that they do not breathe the same air as the common people. Additionally, he tells them that Sabaody is crawling with famous pirates, bounty hunters, and slave traders. Luffy notices a wound on Hatchan's head to which Hatchan tells him not to mind it and also to treat Camie and himself like humans. Meanwhile, Luffy, Brook, Chopper, and Hatchan run into a runaway slave who is begging for someone to take off his slave collar. He tries to take it off himself, but then the collar explodes. The Celestial Dragons come to the scene, and Hatchan tells Luffy and the others to get on their knees. They start kicking and torturing the slave, and Luffy struggles not to interfere.

He plans to wait for Nami while guarding her treasure. Zoro disembarks and heads to town. Zoro yells out that the trees are marked by numbers, so he won't get lost. He first thinks the grove is number 1, due to a bubble blocking the first digit.
Meanwhile, Hatchan explains that the World Nobles are also known as the Celestial Dragons and wear masks, so they don't breathe the same air as common people. The Sabaody Archipelago is also a place where everyone gathers before heading to the New World. There are also infamous pirates stationed there, and there's no law against pirate trafficking. As Navy Headquarters is dangerously close, they need to be on the lookout. Luffy also spots an injury on Hatchan's forehead because Camie and Hatchan need to disguise themselves as humans.
Luffy then puts his head and arms into a bubble and goes inside. A shopkeeper then shows a bike that can go into the bubble. Luffy then operates the bike in the bubble without it breaking. They are called Bubble Bikes. Hatchan just wants to rent two bikes.
As the group rides around, Hatchan points out that the bubble will pop if one leaves the atmosphere of the archipelago. Camie also says the Bubble Bikes can also be used on Fish-Man Island. Pappag also mentions the Mermaid Princess with Brook looking forward to meeting her.
Then, Luffy and Chopper visit a grand bun shop run by Antonio. The buns read Grandline Half as they are meant to be souvenirs.
At Grove #35, Hatchan points out that they are the quarters of the Marines awaiting permission to get to the New World. The purchased goods are placed in a bubble pack. Hatchan says that they need to get to Grove #13.

Luffy's party use their Bubble Bikes at high-speed racing to Grove 13. Meanwhile, a woman bumps into a man named Devil Dias who is pleading for his collar to be removed and wants to go home. He just wants to meet his family again when Luffy overhears. Hatchan points out Devil Dias was sold into slavery, but then, the collar ticks and goes off like a bomb. He then collapses giving up on going to the New World.
Hatchan then warns about the collars while the Straw Hats are horrified. Just then, the group kneels before Saints Shalria and Rosward as they pass through. They see how the collar affected Devil Dias and Shalria sees the slave as useless. She then shoots the slave, and his body is removed.
Hatchan says they need to leave. Brook offers some tea, but Camie turns him down. Pappag warns if one takes action against a Celestial Dragon, all of Marine Headquarters will hunt the target down.

Meanwhile, on another part of the Sabaody Archipelago, Saint Charlos, another World Noble, comes across a critically injured man and the doctors who are carrying him to the hospital.

Episode 394,Rescue Camie - The Archipelago's Lingering Dark History,29-Mar-09,"Duval and his crew arrive on the Archipelago and start gathering the Straw Hats up to bring them to the Human Auctioning House, where the kidnappers have brought Camie. Robin tells Nami why the fish-men and merfolk are not welcome on the island as in the past they had been discriminated against and classified as just fish. At the Auction House itself, Saint Rosward and Saint Shalria arrive complaining that Saint Charlos is late. Trafalgar Law, Eustass Kid, and their crews are already present. Backstage are Camie and the other human merchandise, including the coating mechanic, Silvers Rayleigh, former first mate of Gol D. Roger himself.","The Rosy Life Riders arrive. Sanji gets straight to business and tells them that a mermaid was kidnapped. Franky asks them for help in the search for the kidnappers. Usopp, Franky and Sanji get on the flying fishes and they set off. Duval says that they will pick up the Straw Hat Pirates while tracking down the slave traders.
Chopper is pacing up and down, thinking of Sanji's instructions and the separation of the Straw Hats. When he sees Brook sipping tea calmly, he is shocked and berates him, reminding him of Camie's fate if she is sold. Brook calms Chopper down. When Usopp comes to pick them up, he is shocked to see their relaxed state. Usopp smacks them and they set off, splitting up to investigate the slave traders and pick up the remaining Straw Hats. Sanji is lagging behind since he is on Duval's ride, Motobaro.
Zoro drops off the patient at a hospital and decides to return to the ship, believing it to be anchored at Grove 1. Luffy looks for Camie in a shop selling slaves but to no avail. Pappag starts blaming himself for letting her go to Sabaody Park. He says that mermen and fish-men should not even be on the island but Hatchan wanted to help the Straw Hats. Before he can complete his sentence, he is interrupted by Hatchan, who asks him not to continue. Luffy demands to know and Pappag explains that Camie's and Hatchan’s enemies are not only slave traders but rather every human on the island.
Robin is explaining the past to Nami, saying that fish-men are discriminated against and looked down by everyone. It only stopped 200 years ago when the World Government decided to help Fish-Man Island. However, the selling and trading of slaves is still acceptable on Sabaody Archipelago. Nami wonders if it was due to the past that Camie and Hatchan had to disguise themselves. Franky finds Nami and Robin and tells them that Camie was kidnapped.
Hatchan apologizes to Luffy, saying that instead of helping, he had created more trouble for him instead. Luffy reassures him, stating that they are his friends and they will definitely save Camie. Luffy’s group is found by the Rosy Life Riders and they hitch a ride.
At Grove 1 where the Human Auctioning House can be found, Peterman makes his contribution, surprising the staff with Camie. Saint Rosward and Saint Shalria arrive at the Auctioning House. Eustass Kid observes their entry and comments that compared to them, the ""villains of the world seems much more honorable."" Heat, his crew member, draws his attention to Trafalgar Law, who is seated a few rows in front of them.
Camie is carried backstage and has the collar fitted on her. She recalls the scene on the streets where the collar explodes and struggles more violently. Disco comes to check on Camie and slaps her for making a face. Camie shouts that Hatchan will arrive and beat Disco up, angering him. He attempts to fit the collar on Camie but he faints. A giant opens his eye and addresses the person next to him, asking him to stop pretending as he knew that Haki was used by him and questions his identity. The man replies that he is just an old man who coats ships and loves young girls.","Sanji, Franky, Usopp, Duval, Motobaro, Tony Tony Chopper, Brook, Roronoa Zoro, Judy (K.O.), Monkey D.

Episode 395,Time Limit - The Human Auction Begins,5-Apr-09,"The human auction finally begins, and it is only then that the Straw Hats discovered that their mermaid friend is being sold off at Grove 1. After rendezvousing there (save for Zoro, Luffy, Brook, Usopp, and Robin), their initial plan to extract Camie is thwarted upon learning that the World Government and the Celestial Dragon are involved in the slave trade, so Nami decides that they'll buy Camie back in the auction itself. Meanwhile, the rest of the Archipelago receives news that the World Government is going to execute the captured Portgas D. Ace, a move that could provoke a war with Whitebeard.","At the Marine Headquarters, a soldier reports to Vice Admiral Garp that Silvers Rayleigh is one of the slaves to be auction off at Sabaody Archipelago, making him burst into laughter. Garp says that he will handle the situation himself and orders him and his subordinate not to mention the matter to anyone else. Although the soldier is not very sure of the information, Garp is certain that it really is Rayleigh, and cautions against going up the Dark King unprepared. At the Human Auctioning House, Disco starts the auctions. The first slave is sold for 600 thousand belly. Disco seems to be in conspiracy with some of the bidders in the audience, jacking up the price. Sanji is shown the market price for the different type of slaves, which angers him. The rest of the Rosy Life Riders are still desperately searching for news concerning Camie. Usopp talks to the man who caught the giant slave and finds out that a mermaid has been brought to the auction house. They inform the rest that the kidnapper is Peterman and tells them about Camie's current location. With this, the riders head towards the auction house.
Zoro is surrounded by pirates with their swords drawn, wondering where is Grove 1. A pirate attempts to attack but is frightened by Zoro’s glare, dropping his sword and pointing him in the right direction instead. Duval inquires about the information of the auction and reassures Sanji, saying that a mermaid would be the main attraction and Camie would definitely be saved for last. Sanji is frustrated at their speed but Duval claims that he has been heading for Grove 1 from the beginning and therefore, would be the first to arrive as he is their leader. However, Chopper arrives just before them and Sanji hits Duval. Franky arrives to see some of his crewmates demanding for the return of Camie from the staffs but they refuse. Franky wants to break her out and prepares to attack the house. However, he is stopped by Hatchan as there are Celestial Dragons inside. There is also the matter of the exploding collar that is on Camie. Chopper stops Sanji from attacking the staff while Nami resolves to get Camie back through their system. They enter the house and Heat brings their arrival to Eustass Kid’s attention, who notes that Luffy is not present. The Straw Hat Pirates glare angrily as the auction proceeds. Nami calculates that they should have 200 million worth of treasure onboard and Hatchan says that it should be sufficient but he does not have the means to repay them. Nami states that to get their friend back, money is not an issue and the rest of the crew agrees.
Around the island, newspapers are being distributed to the inhabitants, who are alarmed at the breaking news. X Drake informs his crew that Fire Fist Ace is about to be executed, shocking them all. He states that there is going to be a war, as Whitebeard would surely retaliate against the World Government. The remaining Straw Hats head towards the auction house, while Camie is approached by the staff of the auction house.","Monkey D.

Episode 396,The Fist Explodes! Destroy the Auction,12-Apr-09,"The auction continues, but Saint Charlos arrives and ruins the Straw Hats' plan to buy Camie back by placing an exorbitant bid on her. The proceedings are then interrupted when Luffy and his Flying Fish crash into the Auction House, but he is restrained from rushing the stage by Hatchan, who accidentally reveals his Fish-Man nature in the process. While the nobility recoils in disgust, Charlos shoots him, gloating about obtaining a Fish-Man slave. Luffy snaps and punches Charlos in the face.","Saint Charlos arrives at the Human Auctioning House, glad that the auction has not ended. He kicks his slave repeatedly, blaming him for his lateness which caused him to miss most of the auction. The Straw Hat Pirates notice his arrival and overhear Charlos expressing his desire for a mermaid. 
Disco introduces the next slave, Lacuba. However, the slave collapses and blood drips from him to the floor, eliciting screams from the audience. Panicky, Disco orders for the curtains to be pulled. Nami wonders what happened and Sanji explains that Lacuba bit his tongue, deciding to die instead of living as a slave. Camie is enclosed in a tank and the staffs prepare to reveal her to the crowd.
Zoro arrives at Grove 13 and is puzzled because previously he was at Grove 2. The pirates that surrounded him previously cross paths with him again. Zoro recognizes them and gives them a beating, accusing them of giving him fake directions. The pirates make the situation worst as they try to explain themselves. Luffy grabs Zoro as he flies pass and they head to Grove 1 on the flying fish.
Disco tries to cover up the accident by claiming that Lacuba had a nosebleed. Camie is brought onto stage and displayed to the crowd, causing a massive uproar. Nami gets ready to get Camie back and Charlos exclaims excitedly about the house finally selling a mermaid. Before Disco can announce the starting bid, Charlos interrupts with a bid of 500 million belly, shocking everyone into silence. Camie cannot hear anything from her tank and bangs on it, screaming for Hatchan to rescue her. Pappag and Hatchan sob sadly at the change of events. Disco asks for a higher bid while Charlos smiles smugly. Hatchan gets desperate and contemplates rescuing Camie by force before escaping to the seas. Pappag shoots down the idea, reminding Hatchan of the exploding collar. They stare angrily at the unfolding situation while Eustass Kid comments that he has seen enough and prepares to leave with his crew. Disco bangs his gavel to close the deal. Directly after that, there is a commotion as the flying fish that Luffy and Zoro is riding on crashed straight into the auction house. Luffy exclaims that they should have landed better but the rider retorts that it was Luffy himself who told him to crash into the building. Zoro is still clueless about the whole situation, believing Luffy to be headed for the Sunny and wonders where they are now. Trafalgar Law sees them and grins while Kid also recognizes Luffy. Luffy notices Camie and runs towards her. However, Hatchan grabs and tries to stop him by explaining about the collar and the Celestial Dragons, to which Luffy replies that he does not care. In his effort to stop him, Hatchan uses his other hands and reveals the fact that he is a fish-man to the crowd. The audience asks for him to be restrained and starts throwing things at him. Pappag urges Hatchan to escape while Sanji is confused by the crowd’s reaction. Nami informs them that fish-man and merfolk are actually discriminated against on Saboady Archipelago.
A shot meant for Hatchan is fired by Charlos. Luffy halts and turns while Camie looks on in horror as Hatchan collapses. Charlos jumps around, proud of the fact that he shot a fish-man. The crowd is relieved while Charlos revels in the fact that he has just gotten a slave for free. Luffy stalks towards him angrily but is stopped by Hatchan, who reminds him of the promise he made: not to touch the Celestial Dragons even if someone was shot right before him. Hatchan states that he deserves it since he did awful things in the past. He apologizes to Luffy and says that he never wanted things to turn out this way, explaining that he just wanted to make amends to Nami for his past actions. Nami is surprised at this revelation while Hatchan continues apologizing profusely. Charlos is irked by Hatchan and prepares to fire another shot. Luffy stares at him angrily and heads towards him. Pappag shouts for Luffy to stop but his words are unheeded. Charlos fires two shots, which are dodged by Luffy with ease. Within reach, Luffy punches Charlos, sending him flying.","Disco, Pascia, Jean Bart, Saint Charlos, Tony Tony Chopper, Nami, Sanji, Franky, Hatchan, Pappag, Eustass Kid, Heat, Killer, Wire, Trafalgar Law, Saint Shalria, Saint Rosward, Saru, Lacuba, Brook (flashback), Camie, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Struggle in the Auction Hall,19-Apr-09,"After Luffy punches Charlos, the guards begin to attack the Straw Hats, and most of the observers, except for Charlos' family, Kid and Law's crews, evacuate. The Straw Hats fight the guards as Robin, Brook, and Usopp arrive to help, with Usopp accidentally knocking Rosward unconscious, as he falls through the roof, and works to save Camie. The Marines are alerted to Luffy attacking Charlos, and surround the Auction House. An infuriated Shalria attempts to kill Camie, but is knocked out by a sudden burst of Haki from Rayleigh, who emerges from backstage and reveals himself to Luffy.","Luffy apologizes, knowing that his actions would bring an Admiral and a warship down from the Marine Headquarters to Sabaody Archipelago. Zoro is disappointed that he is denied his chance to cut Saint Charlos. Chopper says that he will tend to Hatchan's injuries and asks Franky to search for the key to free Camie. Saint Rosward is furious and fires at Luffy. The audience panics and evacuates from the building, with the exception of the Kid Pirates, Heart Pirates and the Celestial Dragons. Sanji attacks Rosward and kicks the gun from his hands. The Heart Pirates and Kid Pirates both observe the fight ensuing in the emptied auction stands.
Usopp is on his way to the Human Auctioning House and realizes that he is one of the late ones. He hurries the rider but falls off as a result. Robin saves him and speeds ahead along with Brook.
During the fight, Zoro cuts the tank holding Camie captive, allowing communication. Eustass Kid agrees that the rumors are true and that Luffy is one crazy guy.
Robin observed that there seem to be an uproar as the crowd is running for the exit. Brook tells the rider to crash inside while Usopp panics, saying that he is not ready. Robin and Brook jump off their ride and are on the offensive immediately. Usopp stands on the roof, not daring to jump and is pushed by the flying fish. He crashes into Rosward, knocking him unconscious and breaking his glasses. Nami tells Usopp about the imminent arrival of a warship and an admiral. However, Law says that the Marines had surrounded the house even before the auction had commenced. He wonders who the marine’s target is as they could not possibly have known that the Celestial Dragons would be beaten beforehand. Robin identifies him and informs Luffy that Law is a pirate. She also introduces Kid to the crew.
Saint Shalria aims her pistol at Camie, wanting to kill the mermaid that the Straw Hats want to save. The crew looks on in horror as they are unable to stop her in time but before Shalria can pull the trigger, she faints and falls off the ladder. Rayleigh and the giant break through the stage and talk about the state of the hall. Rayleigh also reveals his intention of being there, which is to steal money. The guards are alarmed that the 'auction items' have escaped from their cage and even disposed of their neck rings. Hatchan calls out to Rayleigh. Observing the surroundings, Rayleigh comes to a conclusion about the events that occurred and uses his power to knock out the remaining guards in the room, shocking all the pirates. Rayleigh comments that the straw hat is really suitable for a fearless man like Luffy and tells him that he always wanted to meet him.","Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Silvers Rayleigh helps Camie before Luffy, Kid, and Law start tackling the growing Marine presence outside the auction house.","Word quickly spreads around Sabaody Archipelago that Monkey D. Luffy struck World Noble Saint Charlos at the Human Auctioning House, and the residents fear for their lives, knowing a Marine Admiral is likely coming. Capone Bege and Jewelry Bonney leave, with Bonney swearing she will destroy Luffy in the New World for cutting her fun at Sabaody short. X Drake, Urouge, Scratchmen Apoo, and Basil Hawkins also prep their crews, but want to observe before leaving. At Mary Geoise, Sengoku gets the report of the attack, with a confirmation of up to five of the Supernovas (including Zoro, Eustass Kid, Killer, and Trafalgar Law) also present. Admiral Kizaru, who is present, tells Sengoku that he will take care of it, and will not be long.
Back at the Auction House, Disco reports to Donquixote Doflamingo about the assault and the breakout of the slaves awaiting sale. Doflamingo, however, has decided that slavery is passé, and washes his hands of the Auction House. He says ""SMILEs"" are the future, and leaves the situation as Disco's problem. He notes that he has been called into action as a Warlord of the Sea to prepare for war against Whitebeard. The Marines have surrounded the Auction House with guns and mortars, with reports that Kizaru is coming with a ""special vanguard"".
Inside, while Chopper tends to Hatchan's gunshot wound, the Kid, Heart, and Straw Hat Pirates observe as the old man that appeared from backstage tends to Camie. He says he will remove the mermaid's collar, causing some around to freak out since they know what will happen if it explodes. Franky is backstage looking for the keys. The old man, however, sets off the timer on the exploding collar. Right when Franky gets the keys backstage, there is an explosion. Camie is alright, and the collar is gone, leaving those present (except Franky) speechless. As Pappag reunites with Camie, Franky tosses the keys to the other would-be slaves.
The others wonder who the old man is, and how he seemingly knocked out most of those present without so much as a word. Hatchan says the old man used a power called ""haki"". The old man notes how strong all the pirates present are that withstood it. Eustass Kid reveals who the old man is: ""Dark King"" Silvers Rayleigh, himself once a very notorious pirate. Rayleigh tells them not to go around saying who he is, inisisting that he is only a coating specialist now. He thanks Luffy for saving his ""old friend"" Hatchan and says the conversation he suggested having can wait until they escape. The Marines outside demand the surrender of the present Supernovas, marking Trafalgar Law and Kid as accomplices to Luffy's actions. Rayleigh leaves the escape to the rookies present, and Kid, Luffy, and Law exit, the three bickering over how each could clear the current siege themselves.
As those still inside prepare to leave, Camie tells Pappag not to regret going to Sabaody Park, the act that got them in this mess in the first place; Pappag says Luffy told him that as well. Rayleigh tells the others they will meet back at Grove 13 (where Shakky's Rip-Off Bar is) after the escape. The other escaped slaves thank Rayleigh and the pirates for freeing them. Outside, the Marines fire their first volley of cannonballs, getting all three Supernova captains to reveal their Devil Fruit powers. Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Fusen to deflect a cannonball directed at him. Kid uses electromagnetic powers to stop a cannonball and shooting it back at the mortars even harder. Law creates an energy field around himself, slashes off the head of a nearby Marine, and replaces it with a nearby cannonball. However, the Marine is still alive, with Law holding his head.
As the Marines regroup to ensure they can rescue the hostages, Kid tells the other two not to interfere. Luffy ignores him and charges the Marines, using Gomu Gomu no Ami to catch a bunch of shot cannonballs and slingshot them back at the Marines, save one that trickled out and scattered Law and Kid. Kid tells Luffy that he is completely insane, and attracts a bunch of guns and swords with his powers, firing them back on the Marines, forcing a fallback. The Marine Captain on the scene asks if Kizaru has arrived, but he has not yet, though reinforcements prepare to join the battle as the Supernova captains stand tall.","Capone Bege, Jewelry Bonney, Gyogyo, Potato, Urouge, X Drake, Scratchmen Apoo, Basil Hawkins, Sengoku, Kizaru, Disco, Donquixote Doflamingo, Eustass Kid, Heat, Killer, Wire, Trafalgar Law, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

The three captains promise to meet and fight in the New World. Luffy's crew escapes with the help of the Rosy Life Riders. A mysterious figure that appears to be Kuma intercepts Kid and Law, and begins to attack them with lasers.","A Marine rescue team enters the Human Auctioning House through the back door with the objective to secure the safety of the Celestial Dragons. Law throws the head that he previously severed back to the marines, shocking them as the head can still talk and feel its body. Law uses his powers to cut up numerous soldiers. Luffy goes into Gear 3. Kid uses his power to attract the Marines' weapons to him. The force is so strong that even weapons inside the house fly to Kid, who uses it to build a massive metallic arm. The captains attack the soldiers as their crews walk out.
The soldiers are commanded to attack the pirates without Devil Fruit abilities. Kid warns Luffy that the next time they meet, no mercy will be shown. Luffy replies that he will be the one who finds One Piece and laughs. Kid stares at him and Killer cuts down the solider attempting to attack Kid. Kid tells Killer that they are going to an ocean whereby people who do not have the guts to say that they will find One Piece will die. The Kid Pirates attack the approaching soldiers. A soldier prepares to cut Law but is defeated by Bepo. The Rosy Life Riders arrive and are ready to set off. The Straw Hat Pirates defend themselves while running towards the riders in order to make their escape.
Law frees Saint Rosward's slave, Jean Bart, and invites him to join his crew. He accepts as long as it means being free from the Celestial Dragons. Law tells Bart to also thank Luffy, who made his freedom possible. The Straw Hats escape on the flying fishes except Franky, who complains about the speed of Motobaro.
Kid gets shot by a beam and he angrily asks why his attacker is on the island. The Heart Pirates make their escape and break the bridge behind them. On the sea, Motobaro is moving at a faster pace due to the modifications by Franky. They pass by Grove 8 and Duval says that it should be the place where Peterman's base is. The Heart Pirates come across the Kid Pirates. Law questions why a Warlord of the Sea is there. Law emerges from the beam attack unscathed. Law comments that he does not want to encounter an admiral on top of all the people he has met, saying that he will make him let them pass, incorrectly identifying his attacker, a Pacifista, as Bartholomew Kuma.","Trafalgar Law, Monkey D.

Episode 400,Roger and Rayleigh - The Pirate King and His Right Hand,10-May-09,"Upon arriving back at Shakky's Bar, Silvers Rayleigh reveals to the Straw Hats that he was the first mate of the legendary Gol D. Roger and also reveals the truth about his crew's dismissal. Thus, they leave soon after with a bit of Rayleigh's Vivre Card for each of them, and he tells them to come back in three days when their ship will be ready. Meanwhile, Admiral Kizaru arrives at the Archipelago.","The Heart Pirates are still fighting off the remaining Marines at the auction house, tearing through them to escape. However, they come across the Kid Pirates, most of whom are already wounded due to Kuma. The Shichibukai immediately identifies and attacks Law, but Law manages to dodge the attack. With the Marines starting to close in from behind, Kid and Law, despite their mutual dislike of each other, tell Kuma they are leaving and prepare to face him. In Grove 8, Peterman has been thrashed by the Straw Hats and the Rosy Life Riders for his earlier abduction of Camie. After giving back Camie's backpack, they depart promising to aid them 'till they leave the island. The Straw Hats then head back to Shakky's Bar to treat Hachi's gun wound.
As they do so, they talk with Rayleigh where he reveals his relation to Gol D. Roger, much to their surprise (Hachi apparently knew this too, but did not tell them since they just needed a coater). Rayleigh also reveals how he met Hachi (the Fish-Man had saved Rayleigh's life when he was a kid, and they had remained friends 'till Hachi joined Arlong's crew, then named the Sun Pirates). Sanji then questions how he could still be alive if Roger's crew was captured, to which Rayleigh reveals that Roger actually turned himself in. The government just made it seem that way to show their strength to the public. Rayleigh goes on to tell them the reason why. It was because four years before he was executed, Roger was diagnosed with an incurable disease. His crew, however, had come across Crocus at the entrance of the Grand Line and asked him to join them on Roger's final journey to keep his disease in check.
Finally, after three years, they had managed to conquer the Grand Line. This surprises the Straw Hats, Brook especially, since Crocus did reveal to them he was a pirate doctor for a time. Rayleigh even tells them that the reason Crocus joined was to find a certain pirate crew, which the Straw Hats figure must have been the Rumbar Pirates, bringing tears to Brook's eyes sockets. Rayleigh continues, stating that after they conquered the sea, Roger was dubbed the Pirate King. However, the title was meaningless since he was about to die. But Roger enjoyed it anyway, as he was a man who loved doing everything in grand style. Eventually, Roger disbanded his crew who silently went their separate ways, fates unknown.
One year later, Roger turned himself in to the Marines who decided to make a public execution of him to throw fear into pirates around the world. However, Roger had other plans; his last words to Rayleigh being ""I ain't gonna die, partner"". On the fateful day of his execution, Roger made his famous speech to the world which, in turn, created the current age of piracy. The Straw Hats are astonished by the story. Rayleigh then tells the group about Shanks and Buggy's apprenticeship aboard Roger's ship, the former of which ran into Rayleigh ten years earlier and told Rayleigh about Luffy, claiming that he had met a kid that said the same things as their captain did.
The story suddenly shifts to a harbor at Grove 27, where a pirate crew is about to set off. Before they can do so, they spot a ship on the horizon that suddenly fires a cannonball with a person actually standing on top of it. The ball lands in the harbor amidst the pirates and the figure, revealed to be Kizaru, awaits orders from his Den Den Mushi.
Back at Shakky's Bar, Rayleigh congratulates Luffy for making it this far into the Grand Line and offers to do the coating job for free, much to the Straw Hats' pleasure. Robin then asks him about the Void Century, telling Rayleigh about a note written by Roger in the Poneglyph in Skypiea. Rayleigh replies that the Roger Pirates did indeed find out the whole history, though he advises her to continue looking for it on her own. Rayleigh says that maybe she could reach different conclusions than those that they reached. Still, he offers to reveal it to her but Robin politely turns him down, agreeing with his earlier advice. Rayleigh also reveals that Roger could not decipher everything like the genius Clover or the other scholars from Ohara. Roger just ""could hear the voice of all things"". Usopp then asks Robin if she would want to let an opportunity like this get away and starts to question Rayleigh about One Piece. Luffy stops him however, demanding that the mystery of the treasure remain hidden since countless pirates were risking their lives just to search for it. He then threatens to quit being a pirate if any of the crew asked Rayleigh about it, stating ""I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A BORING ADVENTURE LIKE THAT!!!"".
Usopp apologizes for his actions before Rayleigh asks Luffy if he can really conquer the Grand Line. Luffy replies that he does not really intend to conquer it, only that the person with the most freedom in the ocean would be the Pirate King, which brings a smile to Rayleigh and Shakky's faces. Rayleigh then tells the crew he will have their ship coated in three days which, until then, the crew will have to avoid trouble. Thus, the Straw Hats decide their best bet is to split up and draw attention away from the shop. Shakky gives each member a Vivre Card so they can find their way back to Rayleigh once the coating is finished and Rayleigh decides to move the Thousand Sunny to a safer location. With that, they bid Hachi, Camie, Pappag, and Shakky farewell for the time being and head back into the groves. Luffy suggests to hide in the theme park though the others (save for Chopper and Brook) reject this idea.
However, the Marines are already hot on the heels of the Straw Hat Pirates. At Grove 27, a warship approaches, causing a panic. As it prepares to make landfall, it fires off a round of cannonballs. Riding atop one, Admiral Kizaru descends on the grove in a frightening explosion and terrifies all the nearby pirates of the lawless area in the vicinity by his arrival. Kizaru announces his arrival on the Sabaody Archipelago back to Marine Headquarters through a Black Den Den Mushi on his wrist and requests a response.","Peterman (K.O.), Duval, Sanji, Monkey D.

The Marine Combat Weapon Pacifista,24-May-09,"The Straw Hat Pirates fight one of the Pacifistas, and while it does not have Kuma's Devil Fruit powers, it is still able to withstand their strongest attacks. It then begins firing devastating lasers at the crew. Elsewhere on the Archipelago, Kizaru easily defeats Hawkins, Urouge, Drake, and Apoo, before Sentomaru contacts him. The situation for the Straw Hats grows even more desperate, as Zoro suffers pain from his wounds.","Kuma's beam is fired upon the Straw Hats while Monkey D. Luffy dodges. Usopp, Franky, and Brook are in shock that Kuma shoots from his hands. He fires another laser and nearly hits the three, forcing them to hide. Luffy, Roronoa Zoro, and Sanji charge at Kuma and they combine their attacks, knocking down Kuma.
Luffy begins to realize Kuma looks different. Zoro knows that Kuma would have dodged their attacks and that the Kuma they are fighting is actually a fake. ""Kuma"" rises again.
Meanwhile, Urouge tries a Retribution punch on the ""Kuma"" he is facing and seems to have an effect. Basil Hawkins judges that fate is inescapable as ""Kuma"" shoots a laser at Urouge, knocking him down. X Drake realizes that the fake Kuma is using lasers like Kizaru's light beams. Kizaru recognizes Drake and dares him to fight the Pacifista, the cyborg that resembles Bartholomew Kuma.
Drake changes himself into a dinosaur and bites down on the Pacifista with no effect. The laser grazes Drake, forcing him to revert to normal. He also sees how the Pacifista can bleed. Kizaru then reminds Urouge and the others that they need to fight him as well. Hawkins then changes himself into a scarecrow with Demon Face and tries to claw the admiral who warps and blasts a blinding light. Kizaru then shoots lasers through Hawkins and more voodoo dolls fall out.
Kizaru then prepares a final light kick, but then Scratchmen Apoo plays some music on his body to distract the admiral. A loud noise seemingly severs Kizaru's arm and fires an intense sound blast at him. Apoo then runs off, but the admiral reassembles himself. He then chases down Apoo using the Yata Mirror and blasts him with a lightspeed kick. Kizaru then kicks Drake quickly as well and fires a powerful shot at Hawkins. Walking to the wounded Hawkins, Kizaru prepares to execute the pirate when his Den Den Mushi starts ringing.
He answers and hears Sentomaru on the other end, demanding why he had no contact. Sentomaru reminds his ""uncle"" that the black Den Den Mushi is for intercepting calls only and informs him that the Straw Hats are fleeing.
The fake Kuma Luffy and his party are fighting continues to overwhelm them and withstanding their attacks. The Pacifista then fires an intense blast at the swordsman who is injured greatly. Sanji knows that Zoro has not had time to recover and knows that the Pacifista is not the Bartholomew Kuma they are fighting and wants to leave immediately.","PX-4, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates are at a disadvantage, unable to scratch the Pacifista. Roronoa Zoro moves forward and attempts an attack, but then, Tony Tony Chopper bombards a Blizzard Rose onto the Pacifista. Franky then uses a Strong Hammer to deflect a blast and punches with Franky Boxing before being knocked back. Nico Robin then uses a Spider Net to catch her friend. Brook climbs a tree and attempts to drop a Swallow Bond en Avant on the Pacifista with no effect. Usopp then shoots an Atlas Comet, stunning the Pacifista and the groups run off. Suddenly, the Pacifista falls down as explosives seem to have effect. Franky realizes the Pacifista is modified. Nami tries to run but is marked until Robin uses a Shock to pound the cyborg. The navigator then charges and fires a Thunder Lance Tempo, which only makes the cyborg fire wildly. Sanji then uses Diable Jambe and uses a Flambe Shot, sending the Pacifista towards Zoro who uses the Asura Nine Lightning Strikes. Monkey D. Luffy then uses Gear 3 and the Gum-Gum Giant Rifle to give a final blow, causing the Pacifista to shut down.
Luffy shrinks from his usage of Gear 3 yet again and the crew rests. Nami hopes the cyborg will not wake up. Robin insists on taking the Marines one after another. Franky seems to think the Kuma-like cyborg was made with living tissue. Sanji wants to find a place to hide, but then, a voice calls out that they had some nerve.

The Straw Hat Crew's Desperate Situation!",7-Jun-09,"Usopp and Brook's attempt to attack Kizaru and save Zoro's life failed, but Rayleigh arrived out of nowhere, and managed to block Kizaru's attack and holds him off. Luffy orders his crew to retreat, declaring that the enemies are impossible for them to defeat at this time, but Sentomaru and the other Pacifista stops their escape and even Chopper's Monster Point form was unable to turn the situation to their advantage. The real Kuma arrives and uses his Devil Fruit powers to make Zoro disappear.","Eustass Kid and Law's crews are fighting a battle against a Pacifista.

Kizaru tells that the two are just wasting time as his Glint-Glint Fruit is Logia. Zoro is too weak to move, so Robin uses Vente Fleurs to try to move him out of the way. Kizaru simply warps and kicks the swordsman down. Just as he is about to finally execute Zoro with a light kick blast, Rayleigh boosts in and kicks the light away.
Kizaru steps off of Zoro and dares Rayleigh to fight, while the latter informs that the Pirate Era has just begun. Sentomaru is surprised to see Rayleigh's appearance. Kizaru once chalked up the Dark King's rumors as ghost stories, and learns that he was once a member of the Roger Pirates. An attempt to hunt down Rayleigh would normally require intense preparation. Rayleigh orders Kizaru to just let the Straw Hats be, but the admiral informs he has come under the instructions of the Celestial Dragons.

Hancock goes to take a bath, and some of the villagers discuss a legend that states that Hancock and her sisters defeated a Gorgon, but received eyes that turn anyone who looks at them to stone. Luffy continues to search for someone from who can lend him a ship but falls into the bath. He sees a symbol on Hancock's back that surprises him.

One of the younger girls hopes to join the Kuja when she grows. The Gorgon Sisters lead their troupe off the ship. Sandersonia and Marigold are surprised that the Kuja missed their leader for so long.
As a Monkey Carriage is prepared, Hancock believes everything on the island is sign. The Kuja look over their haul while Ran's gift is heading for the castle. She meets with Granny Nyon and had procured a newspaper from a government ship.
At the castle, Hancock walks through pleased to be home. She receives a ring, but then throws it away thinking it will spoil her image. Enishida also presents a statue of her master. She feels the statue, but shatters it as it was made from mud and clay. Hancock also learns the defenders were absent, because they were chasing a wild beast racing through the jungle.

As Hancock is bathing, no one is to go inside the castle. One of the Kuja, Ran meets with the eight year old girl and tells of the Gorgon Sister' secret.
Hancock strips naked while Ran tells her story. The Gorgon was a horrifying monster. If anyone gazed on it, they would become statues. Just then, Hancock and her sisters killed the monster. As it died, the monster's death cursed the sisters with monstrous eyes that will petrify and kill anyone who looks upon them. That's why ordinary people must not dare glare at them leaving the castle under heavy guard.
Hancock bathes while the fish carries Luffy around and tosses him further into the jungle. He spots a group of snakes and screams, attracting the Kuja warriors to his location. He runs up the rock wall, knocking the snakes off him. Luffy makes it back to town and ponders his next move.
He learns the Kuja have a pirate ship and hopes to borrow it. Without Nami, he hopes to ask for a ride in their ship back to Sabaody.

The sisters in their snake forms are ready to fight Luffy. Boa Marigold in the Salamander form and Boa Sandersonia in the Forked Snake Form. The people believe the sisters to have been cursed while defeating the Gorgon and has taken its powers. Luffy, however, realized that they have the Devil Fruit powers. Luffy asked for a time-out and used that to remove the statues of Sweet Pea, Marguerite, and Aphelandra from the battle arena. He apologized to the statues of the three women indicating that they were put in that situation because they saved his life. He commented that Chopper may have been able to find a solution just as when he and Robin were frozen by Aokiji's ice. After that, Luffy came into the arena and asked the sisters that all he had to do was beat them up, which surprised everyone present there.
The spectators laughed at Luffy's question saying it was impossible for him to defeat Boa Marigold and Boa Sandersonia. Boa Marigold warned him regarding the spikes between the arena and the spectators. Boa Hancock then gave the order for Luffy to be executed for the crime he committed by intruding on the Island of Women and for disrespecting her. Boa Marigold began attacking Luffy and realized that he was not so bad at fighting. She also attacked him with her deadly poison which he dodged several times. Luffy tried attack Boa Marigold with Gomu Gomu no Stamp and realized that it hurt him to attack. Boa Sandersonia caught Luffy using her tail and Luffy wondered why his attacks hurt even when he fought against Sentomaru, it was the same feeling he got.
Boa Sandersonia acknowledged Luffy as a Paramecia Devil Fruit user. Luffy also acknowledged that they were Devil Fruit users and asked why they lied about being cursed. She told him it was a secret that cannot be told to anyone even if the person is about to die. She stated that he is unable to use Haki, saying that people not from their island are unfamiliar with it.

Boa Marigold then attacked him using the Snake Stick. Both sisters attacked him and Luffy fell backwards more trying not to hit the statues, and towards into the spikes.
Luffy missed falling into the spikes by anchoring his hands and legs. Boa Hancock commented that Luffy was all talk and a silly man, in which Luffy retorted by telling her to shut it and called her an idiot. The crowd got very angry at Luffy's insult of Hancock and called for his immediate execution. Hancock then ordered her sisters to kill Luffy right away. Sandersonia then picked up Marguerite's statue and threatened to break it saying, because she saved Luffy's life as he had stated. Marigold indicated to Luffy that the ordeal is a public execution and not a fight as he thinks it is. Sandersonia prepared to execute Marguerite even with Luffy's yelling for her to stop. As she counted down to smash the statue, Luffy yelled out ""I told you to stop, dammit"" causing him to unleash his Supreme King Haki. This surprised many in the crowd who could withstand it and rendered others unconscious.
Kikyo, and the Boa sisters were amazed as they realized what type of power Luffy had just unleashed. Luffy, unknowing about his ability, ran to Marguerite whose statue is on the floor. He was happy the statue had no scratch and thanked Marigold and Sandersonia for listening to him after all. Boa Hancock was surprised/upset that Luffy has the ability of the Supreme King Haki just like she does, and wondered who Luffy really was. Wondering why everyone was getting so noisy and obstreperous, Luffy acknowledged to the sisters that they were strong and announced for the fight to continue.","Boa Hancock, Salome, Boa Marigold, Boa Sandersonia, Monkey D.

Boa Hancock evacuates everyone in the arena in risk of them seeing the ""Gorgon Eyes.""","As Luffy activates Gear 2 the crowd is surprised by his body, but claims he could never defeat Sandersonia and Marigold. However, as Sonia uses her eight branches technique, Luffy easily dodges all of them causing Sandersonia to wonder how he was able to dodge all of her moves despite using Haki and realizes he was able to dodge them because he was too fast that she herself was not able to keep up. Luffy wraps his arm around her neck and throws her to the ground, shocking everyone.

Episode 415,Hancock's Confession - The Sisters' Disgusting Past,30-Aug-09,"Hancock decides to test Luffy by giving him an ultimatum: either he gets a ship so he can leave the island while the girls remain statues or she changes them back and Luffy finds another way to the archipelago. Luffy however asks her to turn them back without hesitation. Hancock was speechless and expected Luffy to be selfish like all men she's met. At the palace, Hancock shows Luffy the mark on her back to see if he recognizes it. Nyon comes in and reveals Luffy's assault on a World Noble, leaving Hancock speechless. After Luffy gains Hancock's trust, the snake sisters tell him about their terrifying past. After her story, Luffy assures Hancock that he doesn't think less of her which makes Hancock smile and admit she likes him. She then agrees to let him use the Kuja ship to get back to his friends.","At the arena, Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold apologize to Hancock for losing, but Hancock says it's fine and Luffy looks over at Marguerite's body and is relieved to see she's fine. As Luffy is done checking her, he looks up and asks Hancock if she's gonna fight him now, but Hancock says she won't and is done with all the fighting and just wants to end things now. When Luffy asks her to change the others back to normal and if she has the power to change them back, she confirms she does, but says she gives Luffy two options: he can have a ship and be transported back to Sabaody or return the others back to normal and find himself another way to get off the island himself. The three sisters look down on him and Hancock thinks to herself that now he will have no choice but to reveal his true nature. However, Luffy gets on his knees in gratitude and asks her to turn them all back to normal without hesitation leaving Hancock speechless, and prompting Nyon to comment how amazing it is that someone with willpower like Luffy's would bow their head for the sake of the ones who saved his life.
Afterwards, Marguerite and her friends are returned to normal and the others are happy that they are all alright. When they ask what happened to Luffy the other Kuja's inform them that he was invited to the palace, shocking everyone. At the palace, Sonia expresses her gratitude to Luffy for covering her back and apologizes for before and Luffy says it's alright since she said she's sorry and Marigold states if anyone saw what was really on their back they'd have to leave the country. While Luffy wonders what they mean, Hancock says he can come in behind the curtains and as he does, he thinks it's food only to be disappointed and confused as to why Hancock is naked. Hancock remarks how his rudeness is astonishing, but forgets that and tells him to look at what he saw on her back again and tell her where he saw it before. The mark on her back is revealed as a hoof mark and as Luffy looks at it trying to remember it, Hancock tells him to hurry as this is not something she likes showing to others. Luffy states he mistook it for the mark on Hatchi's forehead from before. At that moment, Nyon comes in and tells Hancock she should trust him due to his large heart, despite her hesitation. Nyon reads from the newspaper and reveals Luffy's assault on a World Noble, his escape from the fighters from Central and how he then managed to reach the island in two days, leaving the sisters speechless. Marigold asks Luffy who he is and Luffy retorts saying that he's been trying to tell them that he has no idea how he got there and also mentions that he doesn't regret what he did to the noble because of the way he harmed Luffy's friends. Hancock, overwhelmed with what she heard from Luffy begins to tear up relieved that there are still people in the world that will fight against the World Government and stand up for others, just like ""him"". When Luffy asks who she's talking about, Hancock, knowing she can trust him, says that she will tell him everything and that her mark is the mark of the World Nobles. She and her sisters were slaves.
When she was twelve, she and her sisters were kidnapped when they were on the Kuja's ship as beginner pirates and sold to the Celestial Dragons. The first man she ever saw was the one who painfully branded the mark on her back and is the reason she hates men. Sonia starts screaming from the painful memories and Luffy says that they don't have to talk about it if they don't want to. Hancock continues her story about how she and her sisters were slaves for four years and suffered the worst terrors imaginable, until one day, a fish-man named Fisher Tiger climbed the Red Line and attacked Mary Geoise. Even though he hated humans, he did not discriminate and set every single one of the slaves free and burnt Mary Geoise down. Hancock stated they owe him a debt they can never repay. Hancock says the fish-men slaves he freed decided to join him and he covered their slave symbols with the sun mark and explains that was probably that mark Hatchi has on his forehead. When Luffy asks if Hatchi was a slave, Sonia says that's not the case as everyone on the crew had the sun mark to make it impossible to tell the former slaves apart from the other fish-men. Nyon states that after Tiger's death the remaining Sun Pirate members scattered and formed separate pirate crews. Hancock then reveals how she and her sisters were forcibly fed their Devil Fruits and how she lies and acts the way she does because she believes they would bring shame on their people and themselves. She begins crying uncontrollably and states she would rather lie to protect their honor, and to make their painful memories easier to deal with. Luffy can only watch with a stern and angry look after discovering the World Nobles cruelty towards Hancock.
Nyon starts mocking Hancock and is amused that the snake princess would be this honest about her feelings and that she had thought her heart had become as cold as ice, but Hancock tells her to be quiet and remember her place as an outcast. Nyon retorts that she should be more grateful that Nyon had been out at sea instead of on Amazon Lily because all three of them would have had nowhere to go and she would never have found them if she wasn't away from her home. Hancock says that it is just a small debt she's talking about, angering Nyon who starts yelling that she raised her and her sisters as if they were her own daughters causing Sonia and Marigold to get embarrassed and try to calm her down. Hancock then turns away from Luffy and nervously asks if he scorns her, knowing of her past as a slave, but Luffy says the only ones he hates are the Celestial Dragons and not her. Hancock, while blushing, smiles, saying she likes Luffy, and offers him the use of her ship, making Luffy very happy.","Boa Sandersonia, Monkey D.

When Luffy hears that they are planning on executing his brother Ace at Marineford to lure Whitebeard out, he decides to save him from the prison Impel Down before he's transported away. The only hope of him getting there in time is for Hancock to answer to the call for the Shichibukai, so Luffy can hitch a ride on her ship, but the empress has just caught a disease, and is lying in bed.","After telling Luffy all about her past, Hancock agrees to give him a ride to Sabaody Archipelago with her Yuda-towed ship.

While Luffy expresses how excited he is to see his friends again, Hancock looks back with a confused look as she realizes she's still blushing. Nyon comments to herself how amazed she is that Hancock is trusting Luffy so much and Hancock places her hand on her forehead seemingly uncertain what she's feeling. At the banquet, Luffy eats everything around him, and the girls seem suspicious. The Kuja Pirates misunderstand their Snake Princess's actions and prepare to attack Luffy. But before they can, Luffy, bored, starts to sing Bink's sake and dances with a pan and spoon. It makes everyone laugh, and the party begins. But the girls, who have never seen a man before, interrogate Luffy and touch him as someone places a price to touch him, causing Luffy to yell that he's not for display. Several more girls are interested in Luffy and want to touch him and he runs away despite them seemingly being attracted by his rubber body. He escapes with Marguerite to Elder Nyon's house. While Hancock is alone on a balcony, Sonia and Mary look out and wonder what's on her mind since she hasn't eaten anything and wonder if everything with Luffy has her worried or the fact the call to war has her worried. Hancock picks up a glass and recalls how Luffy is set to leave for tomorrow and realizes she's crying for some reason and starts crying more and drops her glass and falls to the floor in pain and breathing heavily. Her sisters are shocked and go over to help.
At her house Luffy discovers that Hancock is a Shichibukai and admits his surprise. Nyon states she became Shichibukai when Hancock was eighteen, when she became the empress of the Kuja and quickly gained a notorious reputation despite her young age, catching the attention of the Marines and even the World Government, who were frightened of her potential, as she had earned a large bounty after only one campaign. Hancock later opted to join the Shichibukai in order to protect her fellow Kuja, by forming a treaty to protect their homeland from the government, preventing them from entering there. Nyon then reads on the paper about the war between the Whitebeard Pirates and the Marines and surprising Luffy further with Nyon commenting on his lack of knowledge and then reads off the prisoner on deathrow, his brother Ace is about to be taken to his execution. Luffy then is horrified by reading this as he hears that Blackbeard was the one who put Ace in prison and cuts Nyon off revealing he's his brother, shocking Nyon. Luffy asks if Ace is really going to be executed and Nyon says he will and wonders when. She says it's in five days and it will take a week to get back to Sabaody and Luffy says it will be too late by the time he reunites with his crew. He asks for another faster way and Nyon tells him that he's being held at Impel Down, the maximum security prison and decides to go rescue Ace before reuniting with his crew. He says sorry to his comrades after deciding to rescue Ace at Impel Down, and asks Elder Nyon how he can rescue Ace. Elder Nyon tells him that there's only one way to make it to his brother in time, by asking Hancock to accept the call of the Marines as a Marine battle ship can make it in time and Luffy goes to ask her with Nyon.

She tells Hancock her illness is what killed her previous predecessors and that Luffy is here to see her and surprisingly, Hancock says she'll see him, much to everyone's shock that she stood up, especially Nyon who wonders if Luffy really was able to change Hancock so much. On the balcony, Luffy sees her and asks if she's alright and she says no illness will get to her. Luffy tells her about his brother and his desire to save him and begs her to take him to Impel Down and answer the call to war. Sonia and Mary yell in anger claiming Luffy is using her and forcing her to relive her horrors as a slave to go to such a place and that this is why they hate men and refuse to let him use their sister like this. However, despite all this, Hancock, while blushing heavily, says she will happily answer the call and go wherever Luffy wishes, to which Luffy thanks her and now can make it to Ace on time. Her family is shocked by such a thing and her sisters asks what is happening and Nyon says that her sickness is called ""Love Sickness"" and that Hancock has fallen in love with Luffy and all the previous empresses died from being away from their loved ones. As Luffy celebrates to himself being able to make it to Ace, Hancock watches happily and is slightly giggling and blushing at Luffy's antics.
At the palace with Nyon, Hancock is confused with herself and she doesn't want to disappoint Luffy's request and she herself just said she'd do it without thinking and doesn't feel bad about it and feels happy. Nyon explains what she's feeling towards Luffy is love as all the previous empresses fell in love with a man but due to their statuses as empresses, they had to stay on the island and the pain from not being with their loved ones caused them to die from being away from their desired ones. However, Hancock will survive if she goes with Luffy meaning she must leave the island.
Outside, Luffy says his goodbyes to the Kujas and promises to have his crew visit them someday and as Hancock comes, she kicks away some animals and tells a Kuja to be more careful. When Luffy sees her and wishes to hurry, she looks away blushing thinking she can't look at him in the eyes and as someone tells him to call her Snake Princess, Hancock bashfully asks him to call her Hancock, wowing the Kuja's by her smile and Luffy accidentally calls her ""Hammock"" and she corrects him. Hancock leaves the country in the hands of her sisters and Luffy and Hancock set off for Impel Down. Hancock boards Vice Admiral Momonga's ship, hiding Luffy with her. Hancock unfreezes the Marines that were frozen in stone and they begin their way to Headquarters.
A Marine brings news to Sengoku, telling him that Hancock was heading towards the headquarters. Sengoku is apparently pleased, stating that Hancock was the sixth of the seven Shichibukai. The only one that is not willing to join the war against Whitebeard is Jinbe. Sengoku had Jinbe sent down to Impel Down, to 'cool his head', as it appears that Jinbe had come and caused a ruckus.
Another Marine enters, stating that Admiral Kizaru had captured 500 pirates from Sabaody Archipelago. Sengoku says not to annoy him unless it is about Whitebeard and that is when another Marine enters, saying that the Whitebeard Pirates were on the move. The Marine says that they lost contact with the 23 ships guarding Whitebeard, all of them instantly vanishing, most probably taken out by the Whitebeard Pirates. He also states that other pirate crews are on the move in the New World. It is not known if any of these are any major pirate crews. Sengoku tells Marines to start guarding Impel Down, as Whitebeard tries to break Ace out.

Elsewhere, Soran finds Robin in the snow and invites her into her home, avoiding officers who are whipping fellow people of the country on the way. When they arrive, Soran's house mates want Robin to leave, but eventually all but one agree to let her stay in Soran's room (the building's loft). Soran gives Robin some food, and comments that she smells odd due to spending time in the outside world, as Soran has never left the island.

Some time later, Soran returns filthy and Robin asks what work she's told to do. Soran explains that the country, Tequila Wolf, houses a bridge that all the citizens are building to connect many islands together, which has been under construction for centuries. Soran shows Robin some pictures she drew of imaginary places, explaining that drawing makes her feel like she can travel the world. Robin notices a drawing of a Sky Island and describes her journey to Skypiea. Although the officers force people to work until they collapse from exhaustion, Soran explains that she takes consolation that the bridge will allow more people to travel the word, and that she dreams of traveling the world too.

Transmission gets cut off on Level 2 and the other guards want to know what's happening. On an elevator, Boa Hancock complains about the heat and Domino says that the warden's office is on Level 4: Blazing Hell. The elevator stops on Level 4 and Momonga wants to know where the warden is. Domino says that Warden Magellan has terrible digestive problems and usually stays in the bathroom for up to 10 hours a day. She continues saying that he needs 8 hours of sleep so he roughly works only 4 hours a day. Hancock wonders if that's enough for a warden and Domino says that if there is a problem, Magellan is the man to take care of it. The group reaches the bathroom and Domino warns Hancock that Magellan ate the Doku Doku no Mi meaning he's a poison man so to be careful. Magellan eventually walks out and thanks everyone for their time and introduces himself to everyone. Magellan complains about the bright light and would much rather stay locked up in a dark room. Hannyabal then tells Magellan to stop being ridiculous while Momonga says they are pressed for time. Magellan apologizes saying that the poison soup he had for breakfast disagreed with him.

Buggy is shocked that Luffy just took down the Basilisk but is also surprised to see that Luffy is so small now. Luffy turns back to his normal size and wants to get to Level 3 fast. The nearby prisoners are amazed to see what has happened and compliments Luffy and Buggy for defeating the Basilisk (though it was just Luffy alone that did it). The prisoners then ask Luffy and Buggy to free them from their cells and hand-cuffs. Galdino, better known as Mr. 3, can be seen in the cell hoping to escape as well. Buggy, after managing to get the prisoners to beg for their freedom, unlocks their cells and cuffs. The prisoners are excited to be free and thank Buggy for saving them. Luffy then grabs Buggy still wanting to get down to Level 3. More prisoners attempt to escape but they are stopped by the many wild beasts of Hell. Luffy and Buggy continue running and Buggy admits to Luffy that he lied to him. Suddenly, Luffy and Buggy run into the fleeing prisoners and they all go back into their cells. The prisoners don't want to escape due to the boss of the level still around. Buggy then agrees to take Luffy to Level 3 but Luffy says that Buggy doesn't even know how to get there. Suddenly, Galdino walks up and offers his aid on how to get Level 3. Luffy then remembers him.
At Marineford, Fleet Admiral Sengoku has been informed that Luffy has infiltrated Impel Down. Sengoku thought that Bartholomew Kuma had taken care of him but then wonders why would Luffy break into Impel Down.

The people were surprised, showing them into a maze-like cave.
As they went to the back of the island, they found a town. The buildings were all based upon the buildings in East Blue and the islanders told them that everyone living there was from the East Blue. The name of the island was then revealed to be Kansorn Island, also known as Little East Blue. The giant windmill reminded Luffy of the one in Foosha Village; the training hall was for people who came from Zoro's hometown, Shimotsuki Village; Baratie where Sanji was raised; and the most famous girl in town, Luigia, lives in a mansion that reminds Usopp of Kaya. Back in the Sunny, Chopper worried about the team. Nami predicted that they will call them soon. Robin and Franky thinks if Boss joins the crew, they'll have to get an insect cage. Just after that, Usopp called Nami. Usopp told Nami to come to the back of the island, because the people wanted her to come. He hangs up and Nami goes on Shiro Mokuba I to go to the island. After a while, Corto and his brother, with some men, are going to Kansorn Island to capture Boss because it escaped from Shiki.","Shiki, Magellan (flashback), Hannyabal (flashback), Corto, Largo, Tony Tony Chopper, Brook, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 427,Movie-connected Special - Little East Blue is Targeted,22-Nov-09,"Luffy, Sanji, Zoro, and Usopp arrive on the island and go to their favorite places in the East Blue. Nami then arrives, and meets the Orenami fanclub. Finally, the Amigo Pirates arrive, and Luffy gets into a fight with Corto, but then the captain, Largo, shows up and attacks Luffy.","Nami rides the Shiro Mokuba I to a cave where members of the Orenami Fanclub introduce themselves. As they show Nami the inside of the island, they flirt with her. The rest of the crew are looking at the different places of the town that resemble their home towns. Luffy rides on a windmill as the old man tells him that he should be familiar with them because he's from Foosha Village. Luffy replies that he is but they do not have one that big. Zoro went to the training hall identical to the one from Shimotsuki Village. He sees the dummies and remembers the past when Kuina was practicing and battling with him when they were younger. Then, a teacher along with his students come out. As they see Zoro, the teacher tells his students to battle him, thinking that Zoro wants to battle them. But a man stops them and says that he is ""Pirate Hunter"" Zoro-san. The students (and teacher) want autographs from him. Yoko, who was spying on them, gets mad. Going to Usopp, there is a flashback of him telling Kaya about a large goldfish at the South Pole when he was 5 years old. He told her that he was on the goldfish's humongous poop that he thought was solid ground. After the flashback ends, he is amazed by the mansion... and shocked at how thin it is. The man told him that Luigia used to live in a mansion like this. Usopp states that it wasn't like this. Then the door opens and Usopp stares at a girl sitting on a chair. At first, he thinks she is Kaya, but realized he was wrong when he saw an old lady with purple hair.
We then see ""The Baratie"" where Sanji and a cook are in. As the cook prepares food, he asks if Sanji is a Straw Hat member, and learns that Sanji was a cook on the original Baratie. The cook tells Sanji that he loved Zeff's food and tried to steal ideas when it opened. After both go downstairs to the dining area, Sanji is given a meal that looks (and to his amazement, tastes) like one made by Zeff. It triggers a flashback where Sanji tries to learn how to cook by watching Zeff prepare food. As Sanji tastes it, he becomes excited while Zeff looks back at him and smiles. Sanji then runs out, crying, because he knows how Zeff made the dish. Back to the present, Sanji tells the cook that his dish tastes even better than Zeff's, which causes the cook to cry in joy. Yoko spies on them, still angry that the people are enjoying the presence of the pirates. Usopp is shocked by the tiny size of the old lady. She appears to be mad at him and then asks Usopp if he is from Syrup Village to which he replies yes. She also knows that he is the son of Yasopp. Then Usopp asks if she really lived in a mansion there. The old lady then chokes Usopp on the ground and tells him that it is everyone's dream to live there. She also wanted to live there when she was a kid and made it true when she came to Little East Blue. Yoko spies on them as well and is still angry. Going back with Nami, the kids show her a naked statue of herself (based off of her bounty poster). Because it is naked, it was decided by the consensus. Then Nami hits them on the head.
Yoko with a tired Boss is angry at the crew. Yoko is then depressed and Boss tickles her. Yoko then laughs and tells him to stop. Going back to the submarine, the Amigo Pirates with their submarine goes up the surface and groups. Corto and his comrades go up to the submarine and tells them to capture Boss because he took off from Shiki's hide-out. Corto's brother, Largo is asleep, or is having a siesta. Corto wants to beat him up but one of his comrades said not to punch him or his comrades will die. Then they continue off without him. We go back to Sunny Go and Franky is done building an insect cage for Boss. Nico Robin, Chopper, and Brook tell Franky he is good at building. Chopper notes that they are ready for Boss. Going back to the town, there is a feast. The old man notes that it is a welcoming party for the crew. Then the crew eats meat and the others drink sake. Yoko then goes to the cave when Nami comes out. Nami told them that they said they were almost there but made her walk for hours. Then they told her that they wanted to show her the full extent of the island. Yoko then stops by Nami asking her that she is a pirate. She tells her that women as pirates are crazy. Then going to the flashback when Luffy first met Nami saying that he wants her to join the crew, but Nami refuses. Then they told Yoko saying that she can't tell Nami-sama like that. Then she bites him on the head. She runs and Nami told her to stop. Then they told Nami that her father was killed by pirates. Going back to the festival, when suddenly, there was a series of chaingun shots, destroying most of the buildings.
The Amigo Pirates showed themselves with guns, telling the citizens that they want Boss. Yoko then comes out to see what's happening. The cook then sees a piece of wood of the Baratie sign broken in front of him, dropping his pan. Depressed, he goes after Corto but was defeated easily. Sanji helps the cook and the old man saying that he represents the island habitats. Corto then asks where is the beetle. The old man replies that you cannot have him, and says that you can have everything on the island. Corto replies that he does want everything; the money, food, and the beetle as well. Luffy comes and said he could not eat another bite. Corto then asks him who he is and what is he doing. Luffy then turns to Corto, demanding him to go home. Corto asks why, and because Boss does not want to join a pirate crew. Corto gets mad and says he does not want the beetle to join them but to capture him. Corto then shoots cannon-bullets at Luffy but they were deflected easily. Corto is surprised that he is a devil fruit user. Luffy then uses Gomu Gomu No Whip to attack Corto. Luffy calls Zoro and Sanji to help him fight the other ones. Luffy tells Corto that he is going to fight him tomorrow. After that, a net came out of nowhere that captures Luffy. For much danger, the net had spikes in them. It was revealed to be Largo, who has eaten an unknown devil fruit.","Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 430,A Warlord in Prison! Jinbe the Knight of the Sea,13-Dec-09,"Luffy and Buggy find Galdino and together they continue to fight through Level 2 of Impel Down, hounded by both Manticores and Puzzle Scorpions. They are chased into the lair of an enormous beast, the Sphinx, which frightens off the other animals. The Sphinx is a large and powerful creature which, bizarrely, can only speak by saying types of noodles, 'ra-men', 'wonton-men' etc. Galdino attempts to distract the creature by creating wax copies of himself, but only succeeds in provoking the creature into destroying the floor beneath them. With a final cry of 'go-men' (sorry), Luffy, Galdino, Buggy, and the Sphinx are all dropped down to Level 3.
Elsewhere in the prison, Warlord of the Sea Jinbe describes to Ace why he attempted to free him and of his debt to Whitebeard. In a nearby cell, Crocodile mockingly states that Whitebeard's time is coming to an end as many people will try and usurp him. The prisoners in the surrounding cells echo his sentiment.","Some Impel Down guards of Level 6 are talking about how surprisingly quiet it is. One of them says that the people imprisoned there are legendary monsters that have a bounty exceeding 100 million. The guard explains more about Level 6: Eternal Hell how the only way people leave that floor is when they are sentenced to death. Another guard says that dying for the prisoners is better than being locked up. The guards are then informed that warden, the assistant warden, and Warlord of the Sea Boa Hancock will be arriving soon. The guards are confused on why Hancock would want to visit ""Fire Fist"" Ace as he is the most dangerous inmate in the entire world now. One guard then remembers another Warlord that caused an uproar at Marine Headquarters and the Warlord is seen being put into the same cell as Ace. The Warlord is revealed to be Jinbe and Jinbe says he cannot accept death. Jinbe says he doesn't care if he loses his title as Warlord of the Sea but only wants to prevent the war. The guards of Level 6 just got word that the Basilisk has damaged the surveillance room and are shocked to hear that the intruders have beaten it. They want to know what's going on at Level 2.
On Level 2, Luffy, Buggy, and Galdino are seen running from several Wild Beasts of Hell. Luffy says that they don't have time to keep running while Buggy says that they must or they will become the monster's prey. Luffy, Buggy, and Galdino all attack the monsters at the same time but Luffy hits a Puzzle Scorpion that splits down into smaller beings. The monsters continue to chase after them but eventually lose Luffy and the others. The monsters and Puzzle Scorpions suddenly stop running and hear the sound of stomping and run off in that direction. Luffy, Buggy, and Galdino emerge from hiding from above as it is revealed that Buggy separated his feet and tricked the monsters into running away. However, Buggy blew their cover and the monsters soon start chasing after them again. Buggy then says that he heard that the boss of Level 2 is a large, lion-like creature. Luffy thinks the lion-like monsters chasing them are it but Galdino explains that they are Manticores and they will be trouble if they are caught by them. The Manticores suddenly start to imitate people voices and Galdino tells Luffy and Buggy to ignore them, as they're only randomly repeating what the prisoners have been saying; they don't actually know what it means. Some of the Manticores start saying weird things like ""loincloth"" and ""strawberry panties"", which creeps out Buggy (baffled by their stupidity) who asks just who have they been listening to around here. Luffy then asks Galdino how they can get further down and Galdino is surprised to hear that Luffy is not trying to escape. Buggy then tells Galdino that Luffy intends on saving his brother Ace and Galdino is shocked to hear that Luffy and Ace are related. Galdino, not wanting to have any part, tries to escape but is caught by Luffy who asks where the stairs are. Galdino then remembers that the stairs leading to Level 1 also lead down to Level 3 and intends on using Luffy to keep the beast distracted so he can escape to Level 1. Galdino agrees to help out and the group head down some stairs. Galdino ends up running into a large monster and it is revealed to be the guardian of Level 2: the Sphinx. The other monsters run away and the Sphinx suddenly starts to attack Luffy's group. Buggy and Galdino suddenly form a secret ""Escape Alliance"" and plan on using Luffy as a decoy.
Luffy notices Buggy and Galdino doing something but the Sphinx continues to attack Luffy. Luffy dodges the attack and uses Gomu Gomu no Bazooka to knock down the Sphinx. However, this only upsets the Sphinx and Luffy grabs onto the Sphinx's hair while Buggy escapes to high ground. The Sphinx then attacks Galdino but manages to escape by creating a wax figure of himself. Galdino gloats on his powers to the Sphinx and creates more wax figures of himself. The Sphinx then begins to attack the wrong ones and Luffy plays along making the Sphinx hit the wrong ones. Buggy and Galdino are both surprised to see how Luffy is playing along with the Sphinx while other prisoners are getting worried. The Sphinx's crushing causes more problems on Level 2 and Buggy and Galdino attempt to make their getaway. However, the Sphinx crushes the floor too much and a large hole opens sending it, Luffy, Buggy, and Galdino crashing down to Level 3.
Back on Level 6, Jinbe is saying how the World Government calls him a ""pirate hating pirate"" much to Ace's surprise. Jinbe says he spent a lot of time on Whitebeard's ship and admits he likes those guys. Ace recalls Jinbe trying to kill him but Jinbe replies that Ace tried to kill him back. Jinbe then says he wanted to help Whitebeard since Fish-Man Island is at peace because of him. Jinbe remembers the Great Pirate Era that many human pirates invaded Fish-Man Island and it was too much to hold them back. Jinbe says that many Fish-Men and Mermaids were captured and sold but then, Whitebeard appeared saying that the island belongs to him now. Jinbe says he will never forget how Whitebeard protected Fish-Man Island by doing that. Ace tells Jinbe to stop as he is being too hard on himself but Jinbe says he hasn't given up hope. Suddenly, someone from a nearby cell says that it's the perfect time to take down Whitebeard. Suddenly, the other Level 6 prisoners start saying that Whitebeard will die and they want to kill him. Crocodile continues saying how many people will hold back their tears if they didn't get the chance to kill Roger or Whitebeard. Meanwhile, Luffy, Buggy, Galdino, and the Sphinx are still seen falling down to Level 3.","Doha Ittanka II, Crocodile (shadowed), Shiryu (silhouette), Minotaurus (shadowed), Jinbe, Portgas D.

Buggy and Galdino manage to get away from Luffy, and they encounter the imprisoned Baroque Works agent, Bentham, whose stay in the dungeon has not dampened his spirits one bit.","Some of the guards on Level 2 report a massive hole made by Luffy and his party.

Meanwhile at Marine Headquarters, Sengoku berates Garp over his humor at Luffy's actions. After telling him of Luffy's actions at Enies Lobby and the Sabaody Archipelago, Sengoku fears it unprecedented now that Impel Down is in uproar from a riot. However, he is confident that Impel Down is an impregnable symbol of justice. Garp is just relaxing eating from cookies. Sengoku informs the vice-admiral that Tsuru and he needs to keep the incident under wraps and confiscates the cookies.
At Impel Down, Luffy, his party and the Sphinx have landed on Level 3, as it resembles a hot desert with the sand being hot. Buggy complains about he never wanted to be on Level 3, and Galdino complains that his wax is melting from the heat. With no idea on where the stairs are, Luffy and his group decide to search. As the heat begins to wear them down, they spot a hummingbird collapse from the heat. Luffy begins to taste the fried bird.
Then, Buggy spots some prison cells in the distance and hopes they will gain access to the next stairwell. Luffy spots some prisoners who have endured the torturous heat, and are given very little to eat or drink. This is called the Starvation Hell. If they stay too long, they will crumble into sand. Buggy wants to take the stairs on the left, while Galdino hopes the pass on the right will lead them downward. A guard informs someone of Luffy's progress and the man on the other end says all is according to plan.
Meanwhile, more prisoners continue to fight through with no way for the guards to contact Magellan.
Buggy complains the party came back to where they started. As Buggy and Galdino protest going any further, a seastone net is deployed, capturing Luffy and his group. No one is able to break free. More guards with Blugoris arrive to apprehend them. They are led a little imp-like man named Saldeath. Luffy confuses Saldeath's identity for a salmon. The guard informs Luffy that the other guards are demons below them. Sphinx wakes up and begins to shake the net before breaking through crying out food names.
As the guards give chase to Luffy's group, the young pirate takes some down with his Gum-Gum Gatling. Mr. 3 and Buggy decide to desert Luffy planning to sacrifice him. With the guards converging, Luffy continues to fight his way through the guards. Sphinx is now on a rampage so the straw Hat captain uses the distraction to flee.
In the elevator, Magellan informs Hancock that their party will soon reach Ace's cell block. That area is filled with the most notorious criminals and Hancock requested access. The giant warden also informs of another ex-Warlord being held prisoner.
As Buggy and Galdino recover, the staircase going upward is closed off. They then hear French counting that Galdino seems to recognize.

The two pirates insist on not letting Bentham loose.
Luffy races down the stairs while Bentham, freed from his cell is informed that their old enemy is racing down the stairs. Bentham then begins to spin away.
Meanwhile, the alarms blare as the marine complain about Luffy's progress. This action would humiliate the World Government including Impel Down. As they prepare to head inside, a scantily clad woman guard named Sadi-chan appears. She is the commander of the Demon Guards. Sadi whips a marine for not saying chan in the back. Daigin realizes that the guards won't even need the Marines help in capturing Luffy so they can wait outside. Daigin reluctantly agrees and a suspicious koala-like demon is spotted. All entrances to Impel Down are then shuttered.
On Level 6, Magellan's party escorts Hancock to Ace's holding cell. Hannyabal expects Ace to behave, Jinbe is his special guest and Boa Hancock is visiting him. He hopes that when he is warden, Hancock will marry Hannyabal, but Jinbe shuts him up.

Minotaurus confronted Bentham and Luffy with his structure resembling a cow with strong abs, rushing at high speeds and slams his club. Luffy and Bentham dodges, and the latter explains that this demon will toss them around like garbage. The demon pounds his club on Bentham and gets some hits on Luffy. Bentham uses a Wait Just a Foette kick too try and stop the cow-like demon. It has no effect and Bentham faces danger of being strangled. Luffy knocks Minotaurus back with a Gum-Gum Jet Bazooka.
With the danger seemingly over, Bentham recovers thinking he saw the Oh Come My Way garden. He also complains how his make-up was wrecked. The ballerina-like pirate then points to climb the wall but it is hot on the other end. The two jump with the ground being hot for their feet. They then catch sight of the Burning Heat Hell, resembling a boiling pot. If the two jump recklessly, they could be burned alive.
Luffy is intrigued that Bentham wants to meet a certain someone, the Queen of Kamabakka Kingdom the pink paradise of the Grand Line. That person is Ivan, the miracle worker. He leads the queer people. Just then, Buggy and Galdino are spotted running away from Minotaurus and all four of them run for their lives. With Minotaurus being persistent, Buggy thinks back to the Buggy Ball that nearly wrecked Orange Town. Luffy seems to forget that moment. But Buggy has a Muggy Ball and shoots it out of his foot, blowing the cow-like demon back. It seems to have effect, but the monster recovers.
Desperate, Bentham kicks Minotaurus with Memoir of a Winter's Sky and Galdino combines his wax with Luffy's Gum-Gum Mallet Rifle, finally knocking down the demon. The four pirates celebrate their victory wishing to continue their journey.

The two split up and Magellan starts to pursue Luffy who has already breathed in some of the poison from Magellan's attack. Bentham starts to worry and begins to think of ways to help only to realize that he himself would get harmed.

He also uses a Drunken Swan Soiree to bash his way through. He despairs knowing Magellan is unbeatable and all Bentham can do is run away and abandon Luffy to his fate.
Luffy's hands are burning while Magellan says he was brought to his knees. Having spotted that Luffy's hands are covered in poison, it gives Magellan a tremendous advantage.

As he lies on the ground he reminisces about his first day as a jailer. He remembers the sexy pirate Olive, who charms Hannyabal and knocks him out, only for Magellan to lock her up. Back in the present, Hannyabal stands up and grabs Luffy, though Luffy pushes him away. He pledges to the escapees: that there is no way he'd allow their escape, only to get stomped down by the arrival of Marshall D. Teach. Hannyabal falls unconscious, then Jinbe says Teach's nickname: Blackbeard. Luffy remembers Ace saying something about going after Blackbeard, and wanting to capture him. Teach then states that if it wasn't for Ace it would be Luffy heading for execution. Luffy becomes infuriated, and tells Blackbeard he will kill him. Using Gear 2, Luffy hits Blackbeard with Jet Pistol.","Inazuma, Hannyabal, Monkey D.

Episode 447,The Jet Pistol of Rage - Luffy vs. Blackbeard,18-Apr-10,"Although Luffy wants a proper battle with Blackbeard, Jinbe reminds him there's no time for that as Ace's execution will occur in only a few short hours. Luffy moves on, but Magellan is hot on their heels, and ignores Blackbeard's crew, who he beats to a pulp.","Luffy is furious, punching Blackbeard, making the latter fly into the wall. Blackbeard takes revenge and activates Kurouzu, making Luffy fly to his hand. He then grabs the pirate captain and throws him into the ground, which causes blood to drip from his mouth, much to the surprise of Crocodile. Jinbe sees Luffy getting up, only to strike him down and talk about his main priority: Ace. Blackbeard sees Luffy leave, telling him Skypiea and One Piece exists.
Shortly after, Minotaurus comes from the level 3 staircase, punching the New Kama and the level 4 prisoners rioting down the stairs. As Minotaurus enters level 4, Luffy steps right into him, causing others to warn him. Jinbe replies that they should let him be, as he is infuriated. He then stands still, face to face with the Jailer Beast, only to punch him right into the other walls. The two break-in crews separate, only for Luffy and co. to get to level 3.
In between the actions, Emporio Ivankov battled Sadi, and caused her huge embarrassment when 'Okamakov' used the whip from Sadi-chan to tie her up and hang her on the ceiling. Magellan finds her, telling his following guards to set her loose. He then goes on, only to find the Blackbeard Pirates. As infuriated as he is, he does not take time to give Blackbeard a speech, and primarily used his Hydra. The Blackbeard Pirates get poisoned, screaming from Hellish suffering. Magellan goes on, to the staircase of level 3, only to find the unconscious Hannyabal, who he tells in his mind is his successor. He then angrily screams Luffy's name, telling him that he will not escape.","Marshall D. Teach, Van Augur, Doc Q, Stronger, Laffitte, Monkey D.

Episode 448,Stop Magellan! Iva-san Unleashes His Secret Attack,25-Apr-10,"Luffy and the other prisoners are getting closer to the surface, having made it through levels 3 and 2. However, in order to stall Magellan, who is quickly catching up, both Ivankov and Inazuma stay behind. Inazuma cuts down the stairs from Levels 3 to 2, and Ivankov stays to fight Magellan with his ""Newkama Kenpo."" Despite his best efforts, he is ultimately defeated by Magellan, and later, Magellan manages to get to Level 2, and poisons Inazuma as well. Meanwhile, Luffy meets up with Buggy, Galdino, and the other rioters and easily defeats the Jailer Beasts (who had used the elevator to reach Level 1) once again, only to be confronted by the furious Magellan, who has finally caught up to put an end to the potential breakout.","The prisoners race through Level 3 just as Magellan's Hydra catches up poisoning some. Bentham advises not to look back. Magellan walks through, enraged and covered in poison. The prisoners climb the stairway to Level 2. After the prisoners make it, Ivankov mourns those who failed. Inazuma and Ivankov stand at the ready with the former using Great Scissors to cut through the staircase and buy some time to escape. With the staircase cut to pieces, it would seem Magellan has no access to the second level.
Magellan roars his Hydra at Ivankov declaring his methods suicidal. The ""queen"" believes the warden is slow and changes to his male form declaring him stupid, before firing a Death Wink. It dissolves a dragon head, but the next Hydra head comes out of the warden's back and a third one appear. Magellan gloats that even if Luffy has time, there is no way out. Ivankov then decides to show some New Kama Kempo and shoots some energy balls then dares the warden to fight.
At Level 2, the Wild Beasts begin taking down some prisoners. Luffy seems worried that Magellan would strangely not follow him, but Bentham explains that Ivankov is staying behind to hold the warden off. Luffy wishes to go back, but Bentham insists he keep moving. Crocodile and Jinbe believe getting out might be too easy as someone is releasing them. Buggy liberates some prisoners while Galdino hands weapons to the prisoners. They take down some guards with Buggy determined to get to the top level.
Soon, Buggy's party make it to Level 1. Luffy's party continue their ascent as they make their way to Level 2. On Level 3, Ivankov is fighting bravely against Magellan. Sadi feels intense pain in her spine cursing Ivankov's actions demanding vengeance. She orders the downed demon beast guards to give chase. Shiryu severs communications so no one will know about the transpiring events.
With Impel Down surrounded by prison and navy ships, Jinbe hopes to hijack one so they can make it to Marineford before Ace's capital punishment.
Meanwhile, Ivankov feels agonized from the poison that just touched his face, complaining how much it hurts, but this was all a ruse as Ivankov's thick mascara protected his face from the poison. He dodges another poison attack and winks at Magellan's Hydra again and again with the warden shooting a Venom Blowfish. Ivankov complains about his shoots laces coming loose, but he tricks the warden again, as his shoes are laceless. Magellan angrily decides to end the fight immediately, as Ivankov uses the Hair Removal Fist.
Topside, Inazuma spots Magellan using Venom Road to get to Level 2 and had beaten Ivankov. Sensing despair, Inazuma does a Keep Out, sending parts of the floor at Magellan, but he blocks them.
Buggy and his party flee from the demon guards. He then bumps into a big man and falls. Galdino assures if he is ok while Buggy gets angry at the person he bumped into and looks up, only to be surprised that it is Crocodile. Crocodile rudely asks how Galdino got here, which makes him cry. Just then, Jinbe and Luffy are reported to have beaten the demon guards. This surprises Buggy and Galdino even more. When Luffy turns around and sees the two, he is happy that they are safe. More prisoners run and Buggy is horrified at the news that they are perverts. Bentham later rushes in and spin kicks Galdino and Buggy for calling them perverts and abandoning them. Then, the prisoners from Level 4 arrive with the guards surprised and horrified.
Just then, Magellan deploys a Hydra frightening the prisoners. Luffy fears for the worst happening to Inazuma and Ivankov.","Monkey D. Luffy, Crocodile, Jinbe, Daz Bonez, Bentham, Magellan, Emporio Ivankov, Inazuma, Buggy, Galdino, Sadi, Minotaurus, Minorhinoceros, Minokoala, Minozebra",
Episode 449,Magellan's Clever Scheme! The Jailbreak Plan is Obstructed,2-May-10,"Luffy becomes enraged after learning about Magellan defeating Emporio Ivankov and Inazuma, but Mr. 2 and Jinbe persuade him that escaping takes priority. Magellan initiates a plan to move the Marine ships away from Impel Down, trapping the escapees in the prison. Mr. 3 blocks Magellan's poison with his wax, giving Luffy the idea to have him coat his fists and feet with wax so that he can hit Magellan without being poisoned. Jinbe finds a way to reach the ships by floating Buggy, Crocodile, and Mr. 1 on a door and creating a sea current to launch it onto a battleship.","Magellan reaches Level 2 and Luffy heads back to avenge the fallen Inazuma and Ivankov. He is stopped by Bentham, who reminds him what happened last time he tried to battle the Chief Warden. Magellan sends a Hydra at the escapees. Just before Luffy is poisoned a second time, Galdino shows up and uses a Candle Wall to block the attack. Crocodile comments Mr. 3 is not so useless after all. Jinbe overhears the conversation between Magellan and some guards. Bentham and Daz Bonez team up and take down the guards with ease. Meanwhile, Luffy and Galdino team up with some escapees who shoot Magellan. Although the bullets just barrage through him (though not being a Logia, but a Paramecia), Magellan gets hurt. Galdino places wax armor around Luffy's hands and feet so the latter can finally attack Magellan. The two get in a fight between venom and wax.
At Level 1, Buggy takes the rioting prisoners outside, only to see the plan fail right before their eyes. Jinbe shows up and explains to the prisoners about the warships not being too far away. He takes a door and throws it in the water. Daz Bonez, Crocodile, and Buggy jump on the made platform and get driven by Jinbe to the warships. After being attacked by the ships, Buggy thought that Jinbe was a traitor. Jinbe throws the ships in the air with Fish-Man Jujutsu, and the three land on one warship. Ready to battle, they attack their opponents. Back at Level 2, Luffy's and Magellan's fists clash, and Magellan asks Luffy if he remembered what happened last battle (Magellan defeated Luffy last battle), Luffy said he does not. The episode ends when Magellan says ""Then I will not let you forget"".","Magellan, Galdino, Jinbe, Monkey D.

Episode 450,"The Jailbreak Team Driven Into a Corner
Forbidden Move ""Venom Demon""",9-May-10,"Jinbe, Crocodile, and Daz Bonez finally secure a Marine vessel to escape with. Meanwhile, Luffy continues his fight against Magellan, with the assistance of Galdino's Doru Doru no Mi powers. Although at first the pair are confident that they can beat the Warden with their combined abilities, Magellan - seeing the situation is becoming desperate - unleashes his ultimate technique, Venom Demon: Jigoku no Shinpan, which is so toxic it can even poison Mr. 3's wax. With Luffy's wax armor rendered useless, the remaining escapees flee to the entrance with Magellan directly behind them. It is then that Ivankov, who managed to partially heal himself with the Horu Horu no Mi, comes bursting through the ground with Inazuma while using Hell Wink. By clinging onto Ivankov's enlarged head while he uses another Hell Wink, Luffy and the others are finally able to breakout of Impel Down and be carried to the captured Marine ship by a school of Whale Sharks summoned by Jinbe, all seconds before being caught by Magellan who stares on in disbelief.","Back at Level 3, Ivankov lies seemingly dead from the poison, but his fingers twitch and extend his claws. On a Marine ship, Crocodile and Daz Bonez stand before some marines thinking they don't know their limits, The captain orders them thrown overboard, but then, a whirlpool is formed in the water. And Jinbe comes out using a Spear Wave to blast a section of the ship, hitting some marines square-on. Crocodile advises his ally to watch his aim as they wish to use the ship to escape Impel Down.
Meanwhile, Luffy continues his fight with Magellan using a Gum-Gum Champion Gatling breaking through a Hydra with ease and has the advantage on the warden. With Magellan knocked back, he drops to his knees infuriated. The prisoners fire more rounds at the warden again to no effect. Magellan says he ordered the ships to disperse leaving no way to escape, but Luffy insists that Jinbe will get a ship to escape on. Determined to finish things once and for all, Magellan covers himself in red poison. Luffy tries a Gum-Gum Champion Stamp, but the attack has no effect, as the wax will easily wilt forcing Galdino to relieve the wax from Luffy. Magellan uses his new poison to melt through the poison walls and calls his new form Venom Demon, unleashing a massive glob of poison with skulls around it. Magellan slams the Venom Demon on some prisoners with Hell's Judgement, poisoning some prisoners who are left behind to die. The poison blob then continues its pursuit. Galdino worries the poison will melt through rock like acid.
Somewhere on Level 1, Bentham cheers Luffy on while he glares at some prisoners who complain about the fog. If the marines delay the pirates long enough, there is no hope of escape. Magellan could arrive any minute. Bentham implores Jinbe to hurry. Underwater, Jinbe spots some boats. On one ship, Crocodile uses his sand abilities to cut some marines, and drains some oxygen from some. Daz Bonez uses his Dice-Dice abilities to fight some marines who recognize him from the West Blue. As more marines are blasted of the ship by Crocodile's Sables tornado, a marine officer wants the ship sunk by cannon fire. Suddenly, Jinbe's Fish-Man Karate blasts the marines to keep them busy. Luffy's party continues to flee with the Venom Demon closing in. Luffy then calls out to any prisoners ordering them to flee.
As there is no ship in sight, there is no way of telling what is happening. Ivankov carries the poisoned Inazuma feeling exhausted to take another step. Soon, he fires a Hell Wink blasting his way to Level 1, shocking both the prisoners and Magellan. Bentham cries with joy that both Ivankov and Inazuma alive and well, while Galdino hands Luffy a Den den Mushi to call Jinbe. With almost no more places to hide, Luffy is told to jump into the water. Galdino knows the Devil Fruit prisoners will die if they jump into the water. Magellan believes the Sea Kings will eat the prisoners in the water. Luffy goes into Third Gear with Galdino setting a Candle wall up.
With the situation turning bad, Luffy uses a Gum-Gum Giant Stamp to blow Magellan away, before shrinking down to size as usual. Still, the Venom Demon gives chase, while Luffy tries to wake Ivankov up. The ""queen"" wake sup thinking the shrunken Luffy to be a baby. Just when all hope has faded, Luffy orders to prisoners to grab onto Ivankov's head, who fires a Hell Wink, blowing the prisoners outside. Magellan looks on in shock. Later, a flock of sharks appear under some Navy boats. Then, Luffy sees that his party landed on something soft. A flock of whale sharks swim through with the Impel Down warden looking perplexed as the prisoners have landed on the flock.","Emporio Ivankov, Crocodile, Daz Bonez, Buggy, Jinbe, Monkey D.

Episode 451,Cause the Last Miracle - Breaking Through the Gate of Justice,16-May-10,"Bentham puts himself on the line to save Luffy and the others, by disguising himself as Warden Magellan. However in doing so, he sacrifices any chance of his own escape, as the real Magellan corners him in the control room for the Gate of Justice.","The whale sharks hop happily through the water and Jinbe tells them to carry the ex-prisoners to his newly captured Marine ship. The whale sharks form a line while Luffy and the others jump across one by one until they reach the ship. The prisoners celebrate their victory, but Jinbe says there's one more obstacle to freedom. As the prisoners thank the whale sharks, Ivankov wants to treat Inazuma checking for medical supplies. The prisoners insult Magellan thanking Buggy for their freedom. Desperate, Magellan wants a ship to chase the pirates down determined to carry out their death sentence.
Suddenly, Marine ships open fire on the ship being used by the prisoners. With so many Marine ships shooting at them, Jinbe wants to tell that high-ranking officers are being summoned to Marineford, but the enemy won't let them escape to easily as the Gates of Justice won't easily open. Buggy fears they will crash, but the fish-man wants to keep sailing without stopping. More cannonballs rain down as Crocodile and Buggy wish to protect the ship. Crocodile and Luffy repel some cannonballs but the situation is growing worse by the second. It would seem there is no way out.
The gate can only be controlled from inside Impel Down just as the gate itself begins to open. The Marines are horrified that the prisoner's ship managed to break free. As Magellan is about to board a ship, he sees the gates opening without his authorization. Inside, Magellan has supposedly ordered the gates opened and wants it closed after the prisoners make it through. The Marines are confused as the warden has disappeared back inside and has spotted an imposter.
Jinbe felt this was possible, because Bentham stayed behind to open the Gates of Justice. Magellan angrily orders the ship closed, but then the second Magellan wants the gate to stay open. A Marine presses a button, then Bentham uses Memoirs of a Desert Kingdom to smash the controls so the guards can't stop the escaping ship.
With the gate about to close, Luffy senses that Bentham must have stayed behind and if it weren't for his help, they would have died. Jinbe regrets that they lost a couple of hundred prisoners in the escape attempt. He thinks back to how Bentham wanted to open the gate without question as swans never die nor say goodbye.
While baby Den Den Mushis have limited connection, they will be cut off once the gates shut.
Inside, the guards realize that Bentham posed as Hannyabal and mocked the warden himself. Luffy tries to contact Bentham remembering the last time he saved the Straw Hat crew. Luffy had hoped there would be another way as they wanted to break out together. The prisoners frantically try to contact Bentham with no success while Galdino calls out to Mr. 2 in sadness. With the gates about to close, Luffy insists it's time to go thanking his friend.
On his end, Bentham cries out to Luffy telling him to save Ace now that he has lots of friends to help him. He also looks back on the time he spent with Luffy in the prison and how he saved him. With the gates closed, the prisoners have escape thanking Bentham for his heroic sacrifice. Bentham gloats that even in hell, the flower of friendship blooms. He also vows to make the flower bloom again before charging at Magellan while the prisoners cry. As Magellan thrusts his hand asking for any final words, Bentham vows to meet his friends again in the Garden of Oh Come My Way.
In one fell swoop, the prisoners that had escaped were 241. With Ace's execution only four hours away, a flower petal rests on the water.","Magellan, Jinbe, Monkey D.

The prisoners celebrate their escape, but some, such as Buggy, are upset to learn from a Marine officer calling on a Den Den Mushi that they are on their way to Marine Headquarters, and that the Gates of Justice to Marine Headquarters will not open for pirates. During the conversation, the officer reveals Buggy's past in the Roger Pirates and connections to Shanks, causing the prisoners to rally behind him. While some of the escapees are concerned that Buggy will start a mutiny, Buggy manages to convince the prisoners to go with them to Marine Headquarters in the hopes of defeating Whitebeard and standing on top of the pirate world. Meanwhile, the ship carrying Ace reaches Marine Headquarters.","On Level 4, Shiryu saves Blackbeard and his crew by giving them antidotes to Magellan's poison and joins the Blackbeard Pirates.
The Impel Down escapees continue their journey aboard the stolen Marine ship. Buggy and the prisoners celebrate their escape while the Newkama patiently wait for Inazuma's recovery as advised by Ivankov. Meanwhile, Luffy and Mr. 3 look across the ocean while crying and talking about Mr. 2. A few other Newkama join their sentiment. Buggy approaches them and encourages them to celebrate their freedom. He tactlessly suggests that they could make it a funeral for Mr. 2 which earns him a punch from Luffy, the latter stating that they aren't sure if Mr. 2's had died. They banter before Luffy punches Buggy once more and climbs towards the helm where Jinbe is steering.
The fishman thanks Luffy for giving him a chance to save Ace. Buggy follows Luffy and they continue quarreling while Jinbe formally introduces himself to Luffy, mentioning that he is currently a Warlord of the Sea who is ready to resign from the position. He confidently announces that they should unleash Hell at the Marine headquarters and save Ace so Mr. 2's effort will not be wasted. Both Buggy and Luffy scream and fall from surprise upon hearing the statement. The prisoners and the Newkama approach upon hearing their exclamation. Luffy announces his surprise from the fact that Jinbe is a Warlord which prompts the said Warlord to apologize for the delayed introduction. Meanwhile, Buggy is mortified upon hearing that their destination is the Marine headquarters. Jinbe confirms this while Crocodile explains that the ship is currently riding the government-exclusive Tarai Current and their only possible destinations are Enies Lobby or the Marine Headquarters. He reveals that the only reason they escaped is to join the impending war. Both Buggy and Mr. 3 clutch Jinbe, asking him to stop the ship while the prisoners cry out in despair. An okama states that everyone from Newkama land knew about this. Out of nowhere, they hear the sound of a Den Den Mushi ringing which piques everyone's attention. They locate it inside the ship's mast and Luffy picks it up. The Marine officer on the line announces that they have identified the two main perpetrators for the break-out: Luffy and Buggy. The escapees are surprised that Buggy gets priority over the Warlord of the Sea. The Marine continues speaking, revealing Buggy's past as a crew member of the Roger Pirates as well as his connection to Shanks. The Marine officer states that they have yet to find a reason but concludes that he must have the same goal as Luffy: to save Ace. Trying to discourage the escapees from continuing, he adds that the Gates of Justice to Marine Headquarters will not open for pirates so there would be no escape.

Teach in Jaya without knowing who he was, hearing the news about Ace's execution, and confronting Blackbeard in Impel Down. Ace, awaiting his execution in Marineford, recalls his encounter with Blackbeard.","Luffy watches Ace's Vivre card as it continues to burn and starts a conversation with Jinbe. He recalls how both of them had always been together, how they always ate together, slept together, and even tested their skills together.
There is then a flashback of when Luffy and Ace met each other at Arabasta. It shows Ace expressing how he was part of the Whitebeard Pirates, and how the mark on his back was his pride. Ace tells Luffy that Whitebeard was the strongest pirate that he has ever met, and wants to make him Pirate King, not Luffy. With Luffy bluntly stating that he will just have to fight Whitebeard. The scene switches to when Ace was on Luffy's ship, with Luffy asking him if he wanted to join his crew and Ace's explaining how he was hunting down Blackbeard.

Another memory appears of when Luffy met Blackbeard for the first time in Mock Town, arguing on whether the pie tasted good or not. Which continues to the fighting with Bellamy, the customers laughing at their belief of Sky Island, and Blackbeard claiming that a pirate's dream is everlasting. Luffy is then in the Kuja palace, showing his disbelief of the war that was to commence and how Ace is sentenced to execution. Continuing on with the flashbacks, Luffy is in Impel Down and meets Blackbeard, attempting to strike him but to be stopped by Jinbe. It is there that Blackbeard explains how capturing Ace would allow him to become a Shichibukai and how Luffy should be thanking his brother for interfering, or else he would have captured Luffy instead.

Episode 458,"Special Retrospective Before Marineford
Assemble! The Three Admirals",11-Jul-10,"While Luffy's on his way to rescue Ace, everyone at Marine Headquarters gets ready for the execution. The present Shichibukai and the three admirals are summoned to get ready for Whitebeard's attack. At every instance a Shichibukai or admiral is introduced, there is a series of recap clips related to that character, with the exception of Akainu who is still a mysterious entity.","On the stolen Marine boat, the pirates talk about their latest meal and Buggy appears before Jinbe and Luffy. He asks how much longer before they arrive at Marineford and is ignored and Buggy wants to bring down Marine Headquarters. He is also confident the Marines and the Shichibukai are no match for him.
At Marineford, two Marines call out to the Shichibukai about to leave Marie Jois. Moria calls Whitebeard a loon and with three hours until the execution, the Marines call for the Shichibukai with the contingency against the Whitebeard Pirates.
Kuma had fought the Straw Hats before on Thriller Bark and Sabaody and won and would never meet Luffy again. Doflamingo says that Mihawk wants to get his hands dirty. Mihawk had fought Don Krieg's crew as well as Zoro at Baratie in the East Blue. After his and Zoro's intense duel, the black-coated Shichibukai won. After his defeat, Zoro was spared and was dared to surpass Mihawk himself.
Moria calls he needs to be in a hurry and seeks to steal the shadows of Whitebeard's alliance. Like Kuma, he too had fought the Straw Hats at Thriller Bark but suffered a grueling defeat against Luffy's Third Gear. When Doflamingo and Hancock are called out, the latter had met with Luffy and hounded Momonga's party. She grew to fall in love with Luffy after he had bested her sisters, Marigold and Sandersonia.
As Hancock hopes for Luffy's safety, Donquixote Doflamingo has yet to meet Luffy's crew. He had encountered Bellamy's crew in Mock Town and puppeteered Sarquiss into submission before Bellamy swore loyalty. He wants to build a new age for the more stronger pirates and laughed maniacally at his intent. The extent of his strength remains to be seen.
Elsewhere in Sengoku's building, Aokiji is awoken by a Marine. He had fought the Straw Hats before using his ice abilities and nearly executed Nico Robin. Luffy bought time for the rest of the crew to get Robin to safety despite the admiral's overwhelming ability. In the present, it is not lunch time, as Aokiji was simply joking.
Kizaru is called in without lunch. He had fought the Straw Hats as Sabaody leaving the crew with horrific results. Rayleigh bravely delayed Zoro's execution and fought the light admiral. On his way, Kizaru knows he must put duty ahead of the meals.
In Sengoku's office, the enigmatic Akainu stands before his superior. With the execution three hours away, the guards are to take Ace to the scaffold.","Monkey D.

Episode 459,"The Time of the Decisive Battle Draws Near!
The Marine's Strongest Battle Formation is Ready!",18-Jul-10,"Only three hours remain until Ace's execution. Luffy reaches Marineford but finds the Gates of Justice closed. While Garp is thinking about his talk with Gol D. Roger, Fleet Admiral Sengoku reveals to the whole world that Ace is the son of none other than Gol D. Roger.","With the execution three hours away, Ace unchained from the wall. He looks down thinking of his childhood with Luffy and walks down the hallway with the guards holding him tight. He looks up the long stairway and climbs the stairs.
In the South Blue, the civilians worry that Whitebeard will reach Marineford before long. As Whitebeard is widely known throughout the years, an elderly woman reads the newspapers that Marineford has tightened security. In the East Blue, a shepherd senses that Marineford is impenetrable, but one civilian says the fort was attacked before, 20 years ago by Shiki the Golden Lion, leaving much the headquarters in ruin. The battle today would be far worse.
In the North Blue, a man refuses to open his bar at the time of war. In the West Blue, some bar patrons talk about the time they saw Whitebeard. Somewhere in the Grand Line, some kids sing about Whitebeard while one woman prays for salvation.
At Marineford, the city is vacated to prepare for the intense war with Whitebeard as the civilians have been evacuated to the Sabaody Archipelago. The civilians wait to watch Ace's capital punishment with journalists ready to spread the news. A reporter named Reuder wonders if Whitebeard wants a war.
Every ship sent to find Whitebeard has been sunk.
In the main building, Garp bangs Sengoku's desk but Sengoku reminds him that Ace's execution is for the good of the world. The responsibility is on Garp's shoulders, but he simply smiles and walks out.
Marineford is surrounded by fifty Marine ships and one-hundred thousand Marine soldiers at the docks. The execution is to take three hours and hope it will be over. There are also cannons set up to bombard enemies, and finally, the Shichibukai stand at the ready. Finally, the three admirals arrive to take their seats and guard the scaffold, Aokiji, Akainu and Kizaru. The massive force of justice is gathered to ensure Ace is executed no matter what.
As Ace continues to climb the stairs, he remembers when he told Luffy to enjoy life without regret and hoped to head out to sea free than anyone else. He arrives outside over the catcalls of the marines.
On the hijacked Marine ship, Luffy sees the Gates of Justice and calls to Jinbei. The fish-man sees that the gate is shut tight and wonders how to get through. Buggy announces his intentions to conquer the world by taking down Marine Headquarters, killing Whitebeard and become the new Pirate King.
Ace sees the scaffold and walks towards it. The crowd at Sabaody see the action that is intensifying. Any wrong move could trigger the war. The Fire Fist pirate kneels on the scaffold and two swords prepare to finally execute him. Sengoku and Garp walk to the scaffold as well, and the former brings a Den Den Mushi at Ace's side. He announces something shocking; Portgas D. Ace, who is to be executed, needs to give out the name of his father. Ace says his father's name is Whitebeard, but the admiral says that thanks to Cipher Pol, they found out about Ace's father, but not his mother. His biological mother, Portgas D. Rouge, misled the entire world. Ace was born on Batelira in the South Blue. Rouge kept her baby in her womb for 20 months and died after the childbirth.
Years ago, Gol D. Roger told Garp to look after his child.
Sengoku reveals that Ace's biological father is Gol D. Roger, the former Pirate King. The Sabaody crowd watches in shock. Reuder realizes that Roger's bloodline still lives. Ace growls at the revelation.","Portgas D. Ace, Reuder, Lonz, Lacroix, Monkey D.

Episode 460,An Enormous Fleet Appears - Invasion! The Whitebeard Pirates,1-Aug-10,"The world is shocked by the revelation of Ace's father's identity. Garp remembers when Roger asked him to take care of his son, since his child did not have any sins in this world. Ace's mother, Portgas D. Rouge, protected Ace from the Marines by delaying his birth for twenty months, and died after his birth. At the Gates of Justice near Marineford, Luffy and the prisoners from Impel Down witness as the gate mysteriously opens. Back in Marineford, Whitebeard and his allies start their invasion from underwater.","The people in Sabaody Archipelago reel from the revelation of the identity of Ace's father. Hancock is surprised that Ace is not Luffy's blood brother, Koby and Helmeppo are also confused, as they thought Ace was also Dragon's son.
Garp recalls a moment before Roger's execution when he visited him for the last time. Roger tells Garp he is expecting a child, although he will be dead by the time that child is born. Garp does not understand the point of Roger telling him this. Garp says the woman he is having the child with will be killed for associating with him. But this is the reason why Roger tells Garp specifically, because he knows Garp will protect the child. He explains that an unborn child should not be faulted for his sins. Garp tells him to stop being selfish. But Roger knows and entrusts that Garp will take care of the baby.
On Baterilla, Marines invade the peaceful island. One marine tells the one in charge that the information gathered tells them that Roger stayed on this island ""acting un-pirate like. As if he were a father"". The leader tells the soldiers to find all the babies who are due within ten months of Roger's incarceration and to investigate them and all the pregnant women as well as kill all the suspicious women. Rouge walks through town taking note of the chaos caused by the marines much to their oblivion. Time passes while she sits on a rocking chair and it cuts back and forth to a marine reporting when children are due that month. They also look into relationships the pregnant women have, whether their marriages are real or not. Rouge tells the baby in her stomach, ""Not yet... not yet. You cannot come out yet. I'm sorry, not yet. Not yet..."".
It has been ten months since the marines have come to the island and they decide that perhaps there never was a child, that it really was the end of Roger's Age. Soon afterwards, Garp goes to Rouge's home. Rouge gives birth to a baby and while holding onto the child Rouge mentions that Roger said if it was a girl, she was to be named ""Anne"", and if it was a boy, he was to be named ""Ace"". So she names him Gol D. Ace. Shortly after Rouge died, exhausted and happy, with a smile on her face.
Garp leaves the island, taking Ace with him then takes him somewhere and tells a person named Dadan that they will take care of the baby. Some years later Garp takes a young Luffy to the same place he left Ace. Explaining that Luffy will be living with Dadan, that he is to get along with them. An older Ace looks at them with slight hostility.
The episode cuts to the scene when Garp visits Ace while he was still locked up in Impel Down. It is reiterated that these unfortunate circumstances happened because he and Luffy both have the blood of an infamous criminal flowing within their veins. And he took the name ""Portgas"" in honor of his mother who he owes so much, but he wants nothing to do with his father's half. Ace claims his only father is Whitebeard.
Back in the present Tsuru seems to sympathize with Garp who looks upset. Sengoku explains to everyone who is watching that Ace took up his mother's surname and became the pirate captain to the Spade Pirates, while quickly rising strength and reputation. And that was when they realized that Roger's line still lived. But at the same time Whitebeard noticed the same thing and took his old rival's son upon his ship to raise him as the next Pirate King! Ace denies this, the reason he joined Whitebeard's crew was to make Whitebeard the Pirate King. Sengoku interrupts - the only one thinking that is Ace. It made things difficult for the World Government to catch him, since he was now under Whitebeard's protection. And that is the reason why this execution is so important. It symbolises the true end to Gol D. Roger's Age, even if it means all out war with Whitebeard.
Suddenly the Gates of Justice start to open. Luffy and the Impel Down escapees watch in shock and wonder at the opening doors. But, Buggy takes that credit, further cementing him as a great pirate and a supposed ""messenger of God"" to the escapees. The skies darken as an entire pirate fleet, consisting of forty three ships, emerge from the fog. The marines are baffled as to where they came from since their appearance was so sudden. Among the pirates are some of the most fearsome and powerful from the New World including: Doma, McGuy, Decalvan Brothers, and Squard - all allies of Whitebeard, although there is no sign of Whitebeard himself... The foot soldier marines panic a little and Tsuru snaps in annoyance, not to ""look so disgraceful"". Ace is shocked that they have all come as well. The marines are told to keep a sharp eye out since Whitebeard can not be too far off, and Doflamingo just feels excited.
Then a bubble bursts in the middle of the headquarters' crescent shaped dock. Tsuru and Garp wonder if perhaps they have miscalculated where the invasion will come from. Waves continue to bubble from the center and Sengoku realizes they must have coated their ship. Suddenly the Moby Dick, Whitebeard's ship, bursts up from under the water.","Portgas D.

Episode 461,The Beginning of the Battle! Ace and Whitebeard's Past,8-Aug-10,"Whitebeard reveals his Devil Fruit powers in front of the Marines. Whitebeard and Ace's past are shown: Ace was the captain of the Spade Pirates. Ace confronts Jinbe to meet Whitebeard since Ace turned down an offer to become a Shichibukai. Soon after Whitebeard offered Ace to join his crew when his battle has ended, Ace attempted to kill Whitebeard to no avail. Whitebeard allowed Ace to become division commander. However, when Blackbeard turned against the crew and killed Thatch, Ace left Whitebeard on a mission to capture Blackbeard. When Ace asks Whitebeard why he came when Ace ignored his advice, Whitebeard says that it was his fault that Ace confronted Blackbeard.","Three other ships, along with the Moby Dick, have infiltrated the bay. Whitebeard himself from the deck of the Moby Dick, comments that it would be better if his son, Fire Fist Ace, is alright.
Ivankov asks Luffy if Monkey D. Dragon will come and save Ace, as he would never let his son get killed. Luffy replies that although his father is Dragon, Ace's father is in fact Gol D. Roger.
Ace then remembers all the events that led him to being the Whitebeard Pirates' Second Division commander. (Parting with Luffy, his days of him as the captain of the Spade Pirates, a meeting he had with Shanks on a winter island, etc.)
It also shows about his battles with Jinbe and Whitebeard, and him joining the Whitebeard pirates. At first he continues to fight Whitebeard but eventually accepts him as his leader and adopted father and befriends the rest of the Whitebeard pirates. It shows his rise among the crew as he is later promoted to become the Second Division Commander. The flashback ends with him going after Blackbeard (for killing Thatch) against the wishes of Whitebeard, who told him to stay. The episode ends with Ace asking why they came to his rescue even when he disobeyed them, and Whitebeard replies that he is his son.","Marco, Haruta, Jozu, Kingdew, Atmos, Namur, Rakuyo, Blamenco, Vista, Fossa, Izou, Curiel, Speed Jiru, Blenheim, Portgas D.

Episode 462,The Power to Destroy the World! The Gura Gura no Mi's Ability,15-Aug-10,"The sea-quakes made by Whitebeard cause a tsunami to come upon Marineford. But thanks to Aokiji freezing the water, any real potential damage is prevented. After the first attack, other soldiers join the fray, and the war really begins. While everyone is fighting, Dracule Mihawk decides to join the fight and attacks Whitebeard. The episode ends as the giant shockwave from the attack approaches Whitebeard.","Ace apologizes that he did not listen to his crew when they warned him not to go after Blackbeard, but they insist that Whitebeard told him to go—that they look after their own. Doflamingo and Moria are excited for battle, but Mihawk and Hancock stay quiet. Hancock is disgusted by the hot headed men, with the exception of Luffy who she prays is alright.
The water levels strangely recede. To this same affect Luffy's ship is pulled back from the Gates of Justice, and Jinbe is the only one who realizes why. Luffy panics, but Jinbe assures him that they'll make it on time, to Buggy's disbelief. In an apparently miraculous turn of events, the water rushes forward pushing them quickly ahead. However a large shadow suddenly looms over the ship.
We cut back to Marineford to a tense standoff between the pirates and marines. The water levels rise, and off in the distance, giant waves are spotted. The waves look like they are about to drown the whole of Marineford, but Aokiji jumps up and freezes them with his Hie Hie no Mi's power, ""Ice Age"". He attacks Whitebeard with ice arrows that Whitebeard quickly disposes of along with hitting Aokiji. Aokiji breaks into pieces and falls toward the water which he quickly freezes as well. It traps all the ships in the bay, but the pirates use the frozen water as a foothold and charge forth. The marines also start their attack and everything quite quickly dissolves into all out battle, Smoker and Tashigi included. The admirals show their faces, although the men tell Tsuru she can just sit back and relax. She ignores them, telling them it did not matter how far back she went, there was no escaping this fight.
Squard, one of Whitebeard's loyalist supporters, tells his own crew to charge forth. Meanwhile it seems the Seven Warlords are finally ready to get involved. Surprisingly, it is Mihawk who seems ready to jump into battle. It appears he wants to see the distance between Whitebeard and himself. Although there are others, such as Vista who would also like to test themselves against ""The World's Greatest Swordsman"".

Akainu reveals his powers involve magma, by stopping a giant ice block attack thrown by Diamond Jozu. Meanwhile, Koby and Helmeppo question their worth in battle. Then Little Oars Jr., descendant of Oars, makes his way onto the scene.","Mihawk launches his shockwave towards Whitebeard which is blocked by Jozu with his diamond powers. Right after, the Whitebeard Pirates decide to charge forward to which Sengoku, counters by ordering the marines to shoot them with the front cannons. Just as the Whitebeard Commanders break through, Kizaru amazed at their power, decides that for the battle to end with minimal casualties, the better is to kill Whitebeard as soon as possible, willingly leaving his seat to transport himself before Whitebeard and attacking him with Yasakani no Magatama, which is deflected by Marco on his Phoenix Form. The Marines and Kizaru watch amazed as he took no damage, to which Marco replies he did.
Marco then flies towards Kizaru being attacked by his technique, although to no visible effect. Marco is capable of kicking Kizaru and launch him away, this however does not affect Kizaru at all. And just as he orders the Giant formation to prepare themselves, Jozu orders his crew to get away so that he can break the Ice Floor and launch a massive Ice Block (around 10 times larger than the Giants) which forces Akainu to leave his seat, and destroy the Ice Block using his Dai Funka with minimal effort. He then creates a massive Meteor Shower with his volcanic rocks, which sets the battlefield on fire which greatly scares the watchers at Sabaody Archipelago, destroying one of Whitebeard's ships and attacking Whitebeard himself with it, however this has no effect as Whitebeard uses his Bisento to block it. The Marines then continue to shot their cannons at Whitebeard, destroying 3 of the 4 closest ships in Marineford, with only the Moby Dick remaining intact, as Whitebeard, Marco, Jozu and Vista destroy the cannonballs.
The commanders then full charge defeating the Marines on their way, just as the vice admirals defeat part of the Whitebeard Pirates. The battle is so violent that both Koby and Helmeppo are scared and think it's better to run away. Before they can do it, Little Oars Jr. shows himself up, prompting both Gecko Moria and Donquixote Doflamingo to battle.

Hancock finally steps into the battle and ends up harming both pirates and marines, as she does not distinguish between the two groups of men. And then Kuma unleashes an Ursus Shock which finally stops Oars in his tracks. As he falls to his knees he remembers when Ace offered him shelter from the sun, rain, and snow by the form of a giant, handmade kasa. Determined, surprising all of the marines, he gets back up again, and thinking he could at least take one of the Shichibukai down, ends up getting his leg cut off by Doflamingo instead. After one more shot from Moria, it seems as though this is really the end for Oars as the episode ends.","As Oars Jr. makes his appearance breaking through the marines just as the Shichibukai and the Marines are impressed by his size. The marines then are soon to attack him with cannon balls, which have little to no effect on him. Given that he is such a large Giant, the Giant Squad of the Marines is forced to leave their defensive positions to attack him, but he is fast to repel them temporarily by throwing them a Marine battleship which opens a way for the Whitebeard Pirates through the plaza, and as them attack through the place, one of the pirates is about to attack Koby but he is saved by Rear Admiral Yukimura who tells him ""this is no place for the unprepared"", to which Koby feels helpless. Vice Admiral Lacroix tries to fight against Oars Jr. but he soon overpowers him. Whitebeard tells him to not ""rush to his death"" to which Oars Jr. replies ""he just wants to save Ace"" seeing his determination, Whitebeard orders his pirates to cover Oars Jr. The Giant Squad attacks him but he dispatches one by one with relative ease. Give that they never fought a foe larger and stronger than themselves, they are forced to work together to fight him.
The Whitebeard Pirates are soon to attack Boa Hancock but she easily repels all the attacks using her Slave Arrow to turn her foes into stone. She then attacks everybody Pirate and Marine using her Perfume Femur which instantly turns any part she touches into stone and cracks it. She is then confronted by a Marine who tells her ""she attacked Marines too"", to which she replies she ""just agreed to fight Whitebeard, and not to side with Marines given that all men are the same"" while whispering that only ""He"" is different. Oars Jr. approaches the bay, and Gecko Moria is ready to fight, but before he can make a move Bartholomew Kuma steps in, preparing and launching a large and extremely powerful Ursus Shock which damages Oars Jr. massively and pushing away everything around him.
Oars Jr.'s kasa drops and he sees it on the floor semi-conscious as he remembers how Ace made it for him, which he ended liking very much due to not feeling any heat, rain, or cold in any extreme weather condition. Before falling he tries to attack and take one of the Shichibukai, which prompts him to attack Donquixote Doflamingo who is fast enough to evade the attack, immobilize him with his abilities, and then sever his right leg. Furious about how he damaged his body, Moria tries to finish him soon to use him as a zombie, by impaling him with his Tsuno-Tokage, which finally makes him fall as he was just about to take Ace off the execution platform.","Stainless, Dalmatian, Onigumo, Momonga, Little Oars Jr., Bartholomew Kuma, Dracule Mihawk, Boa Hancock, Salome, Donquixote Doflamingo, Gecko Moria, Oars (flashback), Franky (flashback), Sanji (flashback), Roronoa Zoro (flashback), Usopp (flashback), Tony Tony Chopper (flashback), Nico Robin (flashback), Nami (flashback), Lacroix, Lonz, Portgas D.

Meanwhile, Garp joins Ace at the top of scaffolding, remembering better times when Ace and Luffy were children, and how he wanted them to grow up to become strong marines. As he laments this fact, it is revealed that Ace's execution time has been changed, when suddenly a battleship falls from the sky, revealing to be the escaped Impel Down prisoners and Luffy!","Little Oars Jr. is impaled by Gecko Moria and tries to save Ace with the last of his strength but soon collapses destroying everything at the bay with his enormous body, greatly shocking everybody with his defeat. Giant Vice Admiral Lonz tries to kill Whitebeard but he soon disposes of the vice admiral with his Devil-Fruit's powers easily. Whitebeard then orders his crew to climb Little Oars' body and advance, to which they quickly climb breaking through any Marine in their way. Enraged Whitebeard's 13th division commander Atmos confronts and attacks Donquixote Doflamingo for severing Oars' leg, to which he laughs claiming he is ""at the center of history"", and quickly puts Atmos under his control with his unknown ability to attack his subordinates.

As Garp remembers when Ace was born, the Whitebeard Pirates and allies enter the bay, and the ships proceed to destroy everything so as to make the entry easier, but are unable to do so with mere cannonballs until Whitey Bay enters with her Ice Cutting Ship. The now controlled Atmos is manipulated to kill his crew by Doflamingo, as he laughs about how ""Evil"" and ""Justice"" are but subjective matters for those who ""are on the top"" and how the current war is the ""turning point"". Sengoku is told that the Whitebeard Pirates and his allies have entered the bay and calls Vice Admiral Tsuru via Den Den Mushi to put ""the strategy"" into action, and quickly disposes of the pirates who attack her with her powers. She calls every Marine through Den-Den Mushi, to which Whitebeard is very cautious. Garp goes to the execution platform remembering past times with Luffy and Ace, when he wanted them to be Marines, rather than Pirates and is soon to blame Ace for his choice, with both bursting into tears, and Sengoku comprehending Garp's pain.
Just as Koby and Helmeppo are shocked by Sengoku's plan of killing Ace before the schedule, Luffy and the rest of the Impel Down escaped prisoners have stolen the show, they suddenly came down falling from the sky, it was later revealed how they got there (it wasn't really Ivankov's plan/fault). Mostly everyone was shocked at the sudden appearance of the troublemaker Monkey D. Luffy.","Portgas D.

Episode 466,The Straw Hat Team Arrives - The Battlefield Grows More Intense,12-Sep-10,"Luffy finally shows up together with his formed alliance from the escaped prisoners of Impel Down. As they were looking upon the scaffolding where Ace is, Crocodile has set off to attack Whitebeard soon as he had the chance, but Luffy caught up to his scheme intercepting Crocodile with Gear Second and with his body soaked wet. Crocodile then realizes Luffy already knew his weakness and therefore he had no choice but to give it up.
As for the first time, Luffy stands face-to-face with the World's Strongest Man. Showing interest towards the boy, Whitebeard then asks Luffy if he knew what he is against with. Luffy stood up refusing to be told what to do, showing little manners, he competes with Whitebeard even telling the old man that the next pirate king would be him. Everyone was shocked by Luffy's actions towards Whitebeard, but later on, the two of them agreed not to get in each other's way and do it as they please.","Luffy along the Impel Down escapees are falling from the sky, and a flashback starts. It shows how they were pushed by Whitebeard's seaquake which then turned into a tsunami, which quickly scares Buggy and the other pirates. Crocodile is fast in putting them in order by claiming that they can use the tsunami to their advantage and ride the wave. It is then frozen by Aokiji and they can see the battle has begun. Luffy suggests that they unstuck the ship so that it can slide through the frozen wave, but just before they can do something, the Den Den Mushi on the ship tells them (as a message to the Marines) that they should be set so that they can execute Ace ahead of schedule shocking everybody.
They break the ice but much to their surprise they do it in the wrong way and fall. Much to their luck, they fall precisely in the spot where Jozu picked up his iceberg. However, this proves bad news to the Devil Fruit users, to whom Jinbe has to save. Luffy then awakens on the destroyed ship, just to watch the still raging battlefield, and tries to find Ace, but he cannot find him anywhere. He looks everywhere he can, breaking through all the Marines who attack him with ease. Finally, Luffy finds Ace and shouts his name, to which Ace shouts back, which makes Luffy happy. Luffy and the company he brings shock everybody, and Sengoku soon blames Garp who is equally shocked.
Reactions vary, as Dracule Mihawk comments how Luffy always bring troubles with him, while Gecko Moria is outraged by Luffy's arrival. Boa Hancock is glad that Luffy is alive. Donquixote Doflamingo is rejoiced that former and current Shichibukai are present."" and at the same time amused that Luffy is there as well. Admiral Aokiji comments on the group Luffy brings and Admiral Kizaru says that he never thought to see Luffy. Smoker wonders why Luffy and Crocodile are together. Marco recognizes the ""brother"" Ace told him about. Akainu finally seeing the ""son of the revolutionary Dragon"" and ""grandson of Garp"" decides that Luffy needs to be eliminated. Shocked, Sengoku asks Jinbe if that is his will to fight against the Marines, to whom he replies it is and that he ""resigns the Shichibukai."" Garp soon comments, that the escapees have no ""common goal.""
This soon proves to be right, as Crocodile is fast to attack Whitebeard on sight. Crocodile is then repelled by Luffy in Gear Second. Crocodile, who is cautious seeing that Luffy is wet with water to counter his abilities, tells him that their agreement is fulfilled and asks ""why is he protecting Whitebeard,"" to which Luffy replies, ""he makes Ace happy Crocodile is promptly held back by some Whitebeard Pirates. Whitebeard soon recognizes the straw hat as the one once worn by Shanks and remembers a past talk, about him losing his left arm. Whitebeard asks if it was Shanks's Straw Hat, to which Luffy answers it is. Whitebeard then asks Luffy if he came to rescue Ace to which Luffy confirms. Whitebeard angrily shouts that he will die if he tries, which shocks everybody. Luffy is fast and fearless to reply that ""it is not up for him to decide,"" and that ""he will become the next Pirate King.""
Such reply, greatly stuns everybody, so much that the battle briefly stops. Whitebeard is soon to commend how ""cheeky he is,"" and that he will not forgive him if he ""gets in his way"". Luffy replies that he ""will do as he pleases, and will save Ace."" Kizaru soon asks Sengoku if he can execute them all, to which Sengoku agrees.","Monkey D.

Episode 467,"I'll Save You Even If I Die - Luffy vs. The Marines, The Battle Starts",19-Sep-10,"With Luffy as their inspiration, the other pirates fight back with renewed vigor. Fullbody and Jango try to stop Luffy from progressing any further, but he gets past them. Captain Hina uses her Devil Fruit abilities to also try and catch him, however Luffy escapes quickly and easily, much to the three's chagrin. Luffy battles more vice admirals as they gang up on him along with zombies Gecko Moria resurrects. Seeing Luffy in so much danger, Ace screams at Luffy not to come closer, as they have both lived their lives and adventures according to how they wanted to, so Luffy shouldn't get involved any longer. But, Luffy ignores all of this and continues fighting for Ace, because they are brothers. Annoyed by the turn of the war's tide, Sengoku reveals to all that Luffy is the son of the great Revolutionary Dragon and orders that he must be stopped at all costs. Thoroughly impressed, Whitebeard orders Marco that no harm should come to Luffy.","While everybody is amazed at Luffy, both Koby and Helmeppo begin to talk about his selflessness. Luffy alerts Whitebeard about the plan to execute Ace ahead of schedule. Buggy comments that he hates Luffy's fearlessness and Ivankov claims that only Dragon's son could be so brave. Whitebeard thanks Luffy for the information and everybody is surprised they are talking in equal terms. Luffy begins his assault, breaking through all the Marines in his way. Jozu watches Luffy with joy, and sends his division to follow Luffy. Jinbe, Ivankov, and the Newkamas then leap into battle. The 14th division commanded by Speed Jiru also starts to charge. Garp is surprised that Luffy is in the battlefield as Sengoku speaks his thoughts about how the pirates can be encouraged by Luffy. Sengoku then commands the Marines through Den Den Mushi.
Whitebeard is very cautious about Sengoku's plan, thinking over what they are planning. Marco alerts Whitebeard of the current situation about Ace and Squard who is tied with the vice admirals at the bay. Whitebeard warns Marco not to fall into Sengoku's trap as Sengoku is not a man who would make mistakes easily. The 14th division is assaulted by Kizaru who then sees Luffy close by, and decides to attack him. Ivankov saves Luffy by pushing him away with a Death Wink. Buggy and his followers begin to panic. When the Impel Down prisoners mistook Buggy's attitude as bravery, Galdino starts to scold them. Bartholomew Kuma then attacks Ivankov with his beams. After evading the beams, Ivankov is surprised about ""how he can attack him since they known each other for so long"". Ivankov tells Luffy to let him handle Kuma, and Luffy presses forward.
Fullbody and Jango prepare to attack Luffy, who does not remember them at first until he recalls their humiliation, which angers them, and by pure luck, he is able to avoid Jango's hypnotism by looking at a nearby explosion. Both Fullbody and Jango fell to Jango's hypnotism and are then kicked away by Hina, whom Luffy recognizes from Alabasta. Hina tries to imprison Luffy, but he manages to get past her using Gear Second. The Squard Pirates are having difficulties with the vice admirals, and Squard tries to sneak into the plaza to rescue Ace, but he sees a ""mysterious figure"" before proceeding. Luffy fights with several strong Marines, whom he is able to defeat with some difficulty. Gecko Moria commends Luffy's powers, and plans to once again take his shadow, this time for Oars Jr. and sends his army of zombies after him. Luffy tries to avoid conflict with Moria, but is soon stopped by an increasing number of zombies. Kizaru sends more Marines after him, wondering how long can Luffy last.
Ace shows his concern for Luffy and tells him to retreat, which surprises Boa Hancock and Marco. Ace starts to berate Luffy for getting into other's affairs. Luffy replies that they are brothers and he does not care about the code of pirates. Marines start to wonder if Luffy may be another son of Gol D. Roger. Luffy is then attacked by Moria's zombies, but they are subdued by Jinbe who uses seawater to defeat them. Jinbe tells Luffy that he will handle Moria. One of the giants attempts to crush Luffy as Sengoku tells everybody about Luffy's relationship with Ace as an adoptive brother and reveals that Luffy is the son of Dragon, which greatly shocks everybody. Smoker is now able to understand why Dragon saved Luffy at Loguetown.
This revelation greatly surprises the people at Sabaody Archipelago and prompts the Marines to kill Luffy. Garp does not mind since Luffy is already a well-known pirate. Luffy is able to defeat the giant with Gear Third, and shouts at Ace that he will save him ""even if it means death"" which prompts the Whitebeard Pirates to appreciate him due to their common goal, and Whitebeard tells Marco they ""cannot let him die"".

Luffy, together with Jinbe, Ivankov, and the rest of the Newkamas, head on to battle the Marine soldiers while Buggy plays it safe and decides to team up with Whitebeard and fight the Marines. Ace resolves to prepare for his execution and to face the blades of justice, so that the war will end soon. Moria once again attempts to get Luffy, but Jinbe takes him on instead, beating him quickly. As Luffy advances on, he draws attention from Tashigi, which startles Smoker and he immediately attacks Luffy. Luffy has trouble hitting his enemy, nearly getting killed by Smoker before Hancock furiously intervenes. Meanwhile, Ivankov faces off with Bartholomew Kuma, not knowing why he is being attacked by an old comrade. Donquixote Doflamingo reveals the Bartholomew Kuma that Ivankov knew before is dead.","Luffy is capable of defeating the giant from the Giant Squad impressing Ivankov's men. But they tell him that he has attracted the attention of the Marines. Luffy and Co. are surrounded by uncountable Marines and Sengoku orders them to stop Luffy. The Whitebeard Allies try to make their advance, but cannot pass through the vice admirals. The ""Bazooka Unit"" of the Marines shots at Whitebeard, but he easily destroys the cannonballs and the unit. Luffy and the 2nd Division of the Whitebeard Pirates make their advance, just as Ace feels saddened that they risk their lives for him, thinking it is better for him to be dead. Garp asks Ace ""what's wrong?"" to which he replies that he ""will accept anything that happens to him"" resigning to his death.
The Impel Down escapees, try to convince Buggy to attack Whitebeard, to which he agrees, while in fact he is scared. This becomes worse, just as Whitebeard calls him as he remembers him since he was in Gol D. Roger's crew. Whitebeard asks him if he's going to challenge him. Buggy having no choice, voices that he will defeat him, much to Galdino surprise. Whitebeard then asks him ""what will he do after defeating him"" since they are surrounded by more Marines than what even Whitebeard can handle, thus offering Buggy an alliance. The Impel Down escapees believe this is because of Buggy's might, much to how Galdino thinks by himself, ""how can they get everything wrong?"". Buggy finally agrees to join forces with Whitebeard, to what Marco claims ""he's so easy to trick"" since their goal was mainly the prisoners that were indeed strong. More of the Whitebeard allies arrive at the bay, which prompts the Marines to follow Sengoku's strategy.
The Marines step back and stop their fire, while Marine Ships surround them. Whitebeard asks his allies through Den Den Mushi ""Where is Squard?"" to which his men tell him he ""was there just a while ago"". Whitebeard then asks the Decalvan Brothers to ""Follow his lead and command all Pirates"", and is soon to order them to sink the Marine Ships around them, much to the brothers' surprise, thinking it better to make a ""frontal attack"", but Whitebeard is soon to tell his worries about Sengoku's plan, to which the brothers follow up, contacting all allies to sink the ships.
Sengoku is informed that the Whitebeard Pirates and Allies are changing their movements. Sengoku and Garp are soon to commend Whitebeard's action, however Sengoku remains confident in his plan. Luffy and Ivankov's men are halted by multiple Marines, but Ivankov arrives to help. Luffy asks him and Jinbe for help to clear the way, joining forces and brutally dispatching a large amount of Marines with their attacks. Gecko Moria tries to stop Luffy, but Jinbe decides to handle him. Moria absorbs shadows to power himself up, and uses his scissors as swords. Jinbe tells him that ""It does him no good to take in others' powers"", while Moria replies that ""winning is all that matters"".
Jinbe evades Moria's attacks, and is capable of hitting him, which makes Moria expel his shadows. Luffy keeps breaking through the Marines, just as Tashigi and Smoker spot him, and Smoker quickly attacks Luffy. Ivankov tries to help, but Bartholomew Kuma attacks him. Smoker and Luffy fight, commenting on how powerful each other has gotten. Smoker finally pins Luffy down with his Seastone jitte. Boa Hancock then helps Luffy. A surprised Smoker asks her, if ""she's going to resign from the Shichibukai as well"", to which she replies she is ""deafened by anger"" and will kill him. Ivankov tries to reason with Kuma, but then Donquixote Doflamingo, guessing that they were friends, tells Ivankov that he is ""dead"", much to Ivankov's surprise.","Monkey D.

Crocodile defeats multitudes of Whitebeard's lower-ranking men to get to him, but is assaulted by Jozu, who is then halted by Doflamingo. The episode ends with Mihawk blocking Luffy's path.","The Marines are surprised that Boa Hancock protected Luffy from Smoker. Hancock then gives Luffy the key to Ace's handcuffs. Luffy hugs Hancock as a way of thanking her. Hancock is so happy that she fell to her knees in a swoon. The nearby Marines mistook this interaction as Luffy throwing his weight on Hancock and defeating her. Hancock then pictures herself marrying Luffy and having the red string of fate tying them to each other, but is soon brought back to reality when Smoker attacks Luffy again, prompting Hancock to break his jitte. Smoker angrily asks her if she knows what will happen for messing with the Marines but she replies that she ""can do everything, because she's beautiful"". Ivankov confronts Donquixote Doflamingo about Bartholomew Kuma being ""dead"". Luffy soon joins Ivankov and Doflamingo explains that while the cyborg is indeed Kuma, he is not the one they once knew, as Dr. Vegapunk has completely modified him, and he is now a complete human weapon, much to Ivankov's surprise.
Doflamingo then tells Ivankov that Kuma now is just a weapon that follows the World Government's orders and so it is better for him to forget about their friendship. Kuma then shoots beams at Ivankov and Luffy. Kuma then dashes toward the Newkamas and blows them away with his Pad Cannon. Angered, Ivankov attacks him with both Face Spectrum and Galaxy Wink which blows Kuma away, followed by a kick which knocks Kuma down. Ivankov decides that he ""will not hold back anymore"". Just then he becomes depressed at how nobody has ever forgotten about him but quickly recovers claiming that he will make Kuma remember how scary he is.
He then orders the Newkamas to follow Luffy while he deals with Kuma. Meanwhile Buggy and his followers formulate a plan that they soon put into action, but Galdino has doubts. Daz Bonez and Crocodile fight the Whitebeard Pirates who try to protect Whitebeard from him, but are easily defeated. Jozu then confronts Crocodile and is capable of harming him. Just before Jozu could attack Crocodile again, Doflamingo saves Crocodile by holding Jozu back with his power. Crocodile threatens to kill Doflamingo if he gets in his way, but Doflamingo proposes an alliance. Luffy keeps advancing, but finds that Mihawk is in his way.

The Black Sword's Slash Draws Near Luffy",10-Oct-10,"Luffy stumbles upon Mihawk, whom he tries to avoid. Switching to Gear 2, he takes an alternative path to avoid the swordsman but with Mihawk's sharp vision, he is able to attack Luffy with his black sword from a distance. Jinbe comes to the rescue but later fails to stop the swordsman from attacking Luffy. Then suddenly, a sandstorm released by Crocodile brings Buggy in front of Luffy and Mihawk. Luffy uses Buggy as a human-shield to escape from Mihawk. As Mihawk is about to catch up with Luffy, Vista coming out of nowhere, blocks him with his two swords. As the time ticks, the Marines seem to be progressing well in their plans. After Sengoku proclaims their need of being victorious, an army of Pacifista led by Sentomaru arrive at the bay, destroying a number of pirate ships.","Luffy is running towards Ace but Mihawk stands directly in his path. Deciding that he does not have the time to deal with someone as strong as Mihawk, Luffy activates Gear 2 to steer clear of him. Ivankov continues his fight with Kuma, as two of his Newkama soldiers try to hold off Mihawk from attacking Luffy. They hint towards some sort of past experience with the swordsman, who replies with ""I do not remember the face of every worm"" after defeating them both with a single swing of his sword. As Luffy nears Ace, Mihawk uses his incredible vision to spot Luffy's fast movements, and then attacks him with his sword from a distance, pinning him to a wall. Jinbe then steps into the scene, commenting on Luffy's durability and defending him from a potential follow-up attack from Mihawk.
The two discuss the state of the war, and as nearby cannons point at Jinbe and fire, he uses his Fish-Man Karate to stop the cannonballs in mid-air, as Mihawk slices them in all half with a single stroke. The two then begin fighting. Luffy frees himself from the rubble of the collapsed wall and begins to attack Mihawk with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka, but he foresees both his arms getting cut off by Mihawk's sword, prompting him to rapidly redirect his arms. Mihawk comments on how Luffy is not as reckless as he expected as he slashes at straw hat, who narrowly dodges, but the shockwave from the sword cuts in half a frozen wave at the perimeter of the battlefield. While this is happening, Buggy quietly recaps his plan, dubbed ""Make Captain Buggy a Star in Front of Everyone"", to his crew, a plan involving stealing a Visual Den Den Mushi.
Crocodile is then seen confronting Doflamingo who is standing atop an incapacitated Jozu, telling him that he does not like the idea of teaming up with Doflamingo's ""New Era"". He then uses his Sables attack on Doflamingo and Jozu, sending them away in a sandy whirlwind that Buggy and his crew happen to get caught in. Hancock is then seen confronting Smoker, but when she refers to Luffy as her ""husband"" and he inquires about it, she goes into a daydream-sequence involving the honeymoon of herself and Luffy, and the joy of having to cook for him. The daydream ends, leaving Hancock in a state of trance-like infatuation, and Smoker a bit confused.
He is quickly reminded of his objective after seeing Luffy and Mihawk out of the corner of his vision, effectively snapping Hancock out of her daze and angering her. Luffy is then seen running from Mihawk, clumsily dodging a barrage of slashes. Luffy begins charging at him, but is distracted by Crocodile's sand tornado, so he quickly grabs Buggy by the lapels and uses him as a shield against Mihawk's sword, which separates his legs from his torso. Luffy then throws Buggy's torso towards Mihawk, who slashes it into many thin strips.
Buggy angrily reforms his upper half, and with his lower half, launches a Muggy Ball at Mihawk, who effectively redirects it at the embarrassed clown, who cracks a joke before becoming victim to the explosion. Luffy runs away, but is attacked by another of Mihawk's long-range slashes. Marco notices this, and sends Vista to protect Luffy by combating Mihawk. Contrast to the prior fight with the Newkama Soldiers, Mihawk gives Vista a dignified acknowledgement, despite the fact that the two had never met face-to-face before. Luffy continues towards Ace, with a blurred effect on the screen as he runs. Mihawk observes him as he and Vista continue to fight, and observes the fact that ""among all the people on the sea, he (Luffy) has the most formidable ability"". Buggy is seen lying on the ice with his head literally knocked off, as his subordinates praise him for yet another coincidental success; one of the men props up his beheaded body, which is holding the Visual Den Den Mushi in its hands.
The narrator then cues in, followed by a fast-cut montage in which everything has a monochromatic color scheme (first red, then blue, then yellow). After the montage, the two guards standing on either side of Ace cross their blades in the traditional execution style, and both the onlookers of Sabaody Archipelago and the members of the Whitebeard Pirates are struck with confusion and anger realizing that the execution will take place ahead of schedule. Luffy continues to make his way towards the execution platform, and Sengoku comments on his conviction of the outcome of the battle to be a victory for the Marines. Sentomaru then shows up, accompanied by seven Pacifistas which attack Whitebeard's ships from behind, causing much confusion for the Whitebeard pirates, their allies, and most of all, Ivankov.

It appears that part of Sengoku's plan failed as all the pirates were to be inside the bay but Sengoku gives the order to attack all the pirates allied with Whitebeard outside the bay first. The Pacifista are then activated and destroy most of the allied pirates. Sengoku then goes on to say that the encircling walls should be activated once all video feeds are cut. However, the prisoners of Impel Down have captured one of the Den Den Mushi so that they could advertise their 'savior' captain Buggy. Mihawk's battle with Vista is coming to a hasty conclusion and Luffy briefly encounters an admiral.

The episode ends as captain Squard, of an allied crew, betrays Whitebeard and stabs him in the chest with a sword.","Sengoku orders the Pacifistas just to attack Whitebeard's allies. The battle had been postponed so that they will not be trapped in the Encirclement Operation of Pacifistas.
Luffy is charging toward Ace but was intercepted by Admiral Kizaru. He then tells Luffy about the World Nobles wishing for Luffy's death and then he kicks him with a lightspeed kick. Luffy was caught by Jinbe. Thanks to the Whitebeard commander's support, Luffy was able to move forward.
Sengoku orders that all video being broadcast to Sabaody Archipelago be cut off, but the last Visual Den Den Mushi cannot be found. It turns out that it is held by Buggy and many Impel Down prisoners. They are trying to make Buggy famous. Squard was seen with Whitebeard.

Episode 472,Akainu's Plot! Whitebeard Entrapped,24-Oct-10,"As Squard stabs Whitebeard, the pirates and even marines in the war are shocked due to his betrayal. Squard says that he knows about Whitebeard's plot on giving the 43 captains under his command to save Ace and the Whitebeard Pirates. He reveals that Admiral Akainu told him that, and for his betrayal, the marines would leave the allies alone, as the Pacifista units advance over them, destroying everything in their path. As Sengoku's plan goes on, Admiral Aokiji freezes Buggy and his allies, to cut the broadcasting to the world. As an act of surprise, Whitebeard forgives Squard, even though he was a ""foolish son."" Whitebeard uses his powers to give a way out to his allies, and gives them the choice to stand up for what they believe in. As all the allies regain their will to fight, Squard falls to the ground, realizing that he was tricked, and Whitebeard heads off to battle.","With Whitebeard stabbed through by Squard, the pirates and Marines are in a mix of surprise and horror at how Squard would go against his captain. Squard removes his sword while Buggy is in shock with his Den Den Mushi still online. This leaves the people at Sabaody in an uproar. The pirates blame Squard for his action and Marco vents his frustration on the Maelstrom Spider pirate. Squard demands that Marco kill him because Whitebeard is responsible for the whole ordeal. When the large pirate drops to his knees, Squard insists that the battle has been a farce. He accuses Whitebeard of making a deal with the Navy to save Ace and his comrades, but their allies would be harmed. The Maelstrom Spider captain then speaks out that Whitebeard has played them all for fools and he realizes that Ace is Gol D. Roger's biological son.
Years ago, Squard was alone. He often melted down at a bar complaining there wasn't any strong foes for him. Just then the large pirate with a large cape walked into the bar and met him. He learned that his crew had been massacred by Roger.
That is why he despises Roger more than anything. Squard is very angry that Whitebeard kept these secrets. Luffy is shocked that Whitebeard wants Ace to the next Pirate King. While the Pacifistas rain down on some pirates, Squard yells at his superior for lying to him from the very start. He was good friends with Ace. Now that Ace is captured, with the main Whitebeard fleet inside the large barricades with the minor fleet trapped outside, Squard is very angry with Whitebeard.
Squard thinks back to a meeting with Akainu, the marine admiral had informed him that Ace was Roger's son. Akainu was already confident with the war's outcome and Squard tried to charge at him, but was knocked into a wall. Akainu explained that his forces intend to converge and wipe out the allied pirate fleet while sparring only Whitebeard's forces.
Squard then accuses Whitebeard of making his allies sacrificial lambs. The Pacifistas continue to chase down the pirates. With the Pacifistas attacking from behind, and the ice on both sides, there is no way out. The pirates begin to wonder if Whitebeard is lying or not. Squard felt it was a miracle to run Whitebeard through and demands to be executed in return. The other pirates accuse Whitebeard of sacrificing them so Ace would be sparred. Whitebeard just stares silently.
On Sabaody, the people watch in horror upon thinking that Whitebeard betrayed his fellow pirates and would side with the Navy all along.
Back at Marineford, Squard says the crew would be all sons to the large pirate, but some children are worth more. Marco yells that the Navy has lied to Squard, but the pink haired pirate says that Marco is also in cahoots with the Navy. Whitebeard says the deaths of Squard's crew wasn't Ace's fault but it was as it was. He also scolds Squard for being much worse than Sengoku.
As Sengoku sends Aokiji out to hit Buggy, the people begin to think the war was a setup. Then the feed is cut off. Buggy and his crew are frozen by Aokiji's ice. Sengoku then orders the walls to be activated. Crocodile senses that the pirate who once beat him was struck down by his own ally. He then yells at Whitebeard for making a fool of everyone involved. Marco begins to fear that Whitebeard is getting weaker the more older he becomes.
Even with his health deteriorating, Whitebeard yells that Squard has lost his way and seems to slap him, but hugs him even though he is a fool. First, Squard is still angry at Whitebeard for his betrayal, but is questioned who took his heart away from his family. Squard answers ""Akainu"".
In a flashback, it is shown that Akainu said that Whitebeard is considered a hero and the people don't realize the truth. He also stated Squard that Whitebeard had a deal to save his pirates but sells out their New World Allies without a thought. Akainu says they must kill Whitebeard to end the war.
Squard then tells Whitebeard if he killed him, Akainu would spar the New World pirates. Even though Squard despised Roger, Whitebeard says it's ridiculous to pin the blame on a child for the sins of a father. Ace and Squard had gone through happy and painful times together. Squard is told to treat Ace kindly as the crew is all family to Whitebeard. The Emperor then blames Sengoku for all the lies he put Squard through and causes two tremors to crack the ice. The escape route is open as the pirates could hijack the Navy ships at any time. Whitebeard yells to be a true pirate, one must choose a path to walk on their own.
As Squard cries, the New World pirates beg for forgiveness. Whitebeard reminds Crocodile that every human has a heart and can't be strong forever. If Ace is rescued, then Whitebeard will gladly retire. Whitebeard rallies his pirates and continues the charge.","Whitebeard, Squard, Portgas D.

The Marines give chase, but Ace and his brother jump over them, before the former shoot a small Fire Fly barrage and detonates them with Fiery Doll, blowing the Marines away. Luffy blows more enemies back with Gum-Gum Jet Gatling. As the two continue their fight, they look back to their younger days when they raced to a beach. Now running in the present Ace admires how tough Luffy has become while they think of the fights they had in their youth. Luffy admits he hopes to be stronger than his brother, but then their path is blocked by Aokiji. The ice Admiral says they won't live to see the dawn. Ace prepares to engage the admiral who readies an Ice Block and shoots a Pheasant Beak, while the pirate shoots a Flame Mirror. Their attacks dissolve slowly. With the marines in shock, Vista's party charges forward not blaming Ace for showing off a bit.
Meanwhile, Buggy wants a Den Den Mushi repaired so he can show off again that he wants to wear down Luffy and assassinate Whitebeard. When that's done, Buggy plans to be one of the Four Emperors. Watching Ace and Luffy flee, Galdino thinks about Mr. 2's memory and wishes to leave, but is spotted by some Marines seeing through his disguise.
Sengoku recovers infuriated at the blunder while Doflamingo wants to let Luffy and Ace slide. But Momonga gives chase. As some marines are confused on what to do, Akainu orders them to pull themselves together and assures that escape for Ace and Luffy is impossible. Just then, a paddle-boat runs aground scaring the Marines with Squard aboard. Squard tells Whitebeard to leave hoping to show their enemies the pride of the Maelstrom Spider Pirates. Whitebeard thinks Squard is out of his mind.
Some of the pirates think Squard has a death wish and the latter hopes to atone for his stabbing of Whitebeard by heroically sacrificing himself. The Maelstrom Spider Pirate captain is sad that his crew came with him, but they went at their own discretion. Hearing their word, Squard orders the pirates to get Ace out of there. Ace fires a St. Elmo's Fire beam at some marines and is surprised by Squard's actions. Marco worries that sadness will be the result before demanding the Seastone Cuffs be removed from his wrist.
Squard's party charges forward ready to go down fighting, but Whitebeard stops the paddle-boat even on the brink of death. The white-bearded pirate says how it's cruel for a father to bury his own sons and says that everyone needs to grow old and die one day. With their business at Marineford finished, Whitebeard orders full retreat while he stays behind to keep his sons from further harm.
Whitebeard stands firm ready to give one last order to his crew. The pirates protest as they wanted to leave together. While Ace fires a Cross Fire cross, Whitebeard goes on saying that even families must part ways and wishes for his crews to go back to the New World and continue their legacy. With his era coming to a close, Whitebeard says that no ship can carry him to the new age. He causes a quake that begins to break up Marineford imploring the pirates to evacuate and forge their own path. Rakuyo doesn't want his captain to stay behind, while Luffy and Ace protest as well. Giving a proud smile to his sons, he wishes them a new age. He also thinks of the time he spent with his crew as it was a long journey with them. With a smile, Whitebeard yells he will end the fight once and for all.","Little Oars Jr. (collapsed), Portgas D. Ace, Monkey D.

Episode 482,The Power that Burns Even Fire - Akainu's Ruthless Pursuit,9-Jan-11,"Whitebeard aims to take down the whole of Marineford and orders his crew and the other pirates to flee. Ace gives his final, grateful farewell to his captain before trying to escape as well. However, Akainu tauntingly mocks Whitebeard, and Ace, feeling angry and insulted on Whitebeard's behalf, tries to take him on. But it is quickly apparent that Ace is outmatched, and when Akainu aims to land a fatal blow on the now exhausted Luffy, Ace takes the hit for his younger brother instead.","Marineford begins to crumble around the Marines. With the island coming down, much of Whitebeard's crew don't want to leave their captain behind. Angry at their insubordination, Whitebeard tells his crew to evacuate. The Marines continue to rapidly fire bullets at the large pirate who slams his spear down, blowing some Marines away. Some of Whitebeard's crew despair, but Fossa says that evacuation is what Whitebeard wishes his crew to do. With the pirate crew leaving, Luffy calls to Ace who is standing still. Marco also despairs at Whitebeard's situation. Galdino laughs confidently over the rescue of Ace and is about to be cut down by some Marines, but uses a wax turtle shell to protect himself. Galdino says to the soldiers that his skills are still adept and is nearly shot, but flees.
As Whitebeard continues to pummel Marineford, Sengoku realizes the white-bearded pirate wants to sink the entire island and take every Marine with him. Meanwhile, Garp recovers believing the old era is coming to a close. On Sabaody Archipelago, the people are concerned for Whitebeard's condition thinking he might have betrayed his allies. They look back at how Buggy blocked off their view of the fight. On his part, Buggy is angry that the Den Den Mushi he's glaring at is still within its shell as he wants to overthrow Whitebeard and announce his victory. With the snail too scared to come out, Buggy believes it only wants to do its job. Suddenly, the snail comes out crying. The former prisoners suggest that Buggy announce his intent to conquer the world. Soon, Buggy decides to start his speech.
Just then, the Sabaody monitors go online and Buggy greets the people on their end. With the pirates racing back to their ships, Whitebeard continues to hold his own against the Marines. Jozu is still frozen making him too heavy to carry out. So Blenheim is called. Ivankov calls for Luffy to depart while Ace continues to stand still. With the Marines closing in, Ace fires a fire blast at the Marines. Ace kneels before his captain exhausted. With the time for words passing, Whitebeard asks one last thing from Ace, if he is happy to be father to him. After Ace looks back on his meetings with Whitebeard, he tearfully says he is happy that Whitebeard is his father. Whitebeard laughs With the scaffold destroyed, Buggy announces to the people on Sabaody he will become a legend but is beaten up for messing the part.
As the pirates near freedom, Jinbe tells Ace and Luffy to stay in front as the Marines wish to target them. After the pirates steal a Navy ship, Akainu knows escape is futile and fires a lava fist at some pirates. Jinbe tells his two allies not to look back. Sakazuki gloats that the pirates would be cowards after saving Ace. Kingdew senses that Sakazuki is trying to send the pirates over the edge. The Marine admiral then insults Whitebeard as a ""washed up failure"", driving Ace off the deep end. Ace turns to face Akainu in a fit of rage ignoring the pleas of his friends. Sakazuki tells of how Ace's biological father, Gol D. Roger conquered the Grand Line and started the Great Pirate Era by sacrificing himself. He also says that Whitebeard is a failure thanks to his lack of ambition and thinks he is a coward.
As Whitebeard will soon be forgotten, Ace marches forward covered in fire while Akainu thinks the crew has been deluded. Angered, Ace says there is nothing fake about the Whitebeard pirates while Sakazuki wants the pirates dead as failures. Determined to protect his father's era, Ace shoots a fiery fist while Akainu shoots a magma fist; The latter's magma easily breaks through Ace knocking him back. Sakazuki gloats that even if Ace is made of fire, his own magma can burn several times the effect. Luffy tries to intervene, but drops to his knees as well as the Vivre Card. Seeing how he has the opportunity to end the bloodlines of Gol D. Roger and Monkey D. Dragon, Akainu aims for Luffy who is trying to reach Ace's Vivre Card. Seconds later, Ace's beads fall to the ground as Ace has shielded Luffy from Sakazuki's fist. The pirates and Garp are shocked as the Vivre Card begins to burn up again.","Whitebeard, Haruta, Blenheim, Agsilly, Fossa, Portgas D. Ace, Monkey D. Luffy, Marco, Galdino, Sengoku, Monkey D.

Episode 483,Looking for the Answer - Fire Fist Ace Dies on the Battlefield,16-Jan-11,"Ace is punched by a magma fist through the back by Admiral Akainu, and falls into Luffy's arms. He then thinks about his past, and remembers his goal in life: to find out whether or not he had deserved to be born. Akainu proceeds to attack Luffy, but Jinbe stops his advance. Marco and Vista then rush to the aid of Luffy and strike Akainu with Haki imbued attacks, but realize they are ineffective against the admiral. As everyone else stares in shock at Ace's wounds, they deduce that his organs were burned beyond help, and tell Luffy that Ace will not make it. Just as Ace dies, he thanks Luffy for everything and everyone for loving him. Luffy is then seen crying for the loss of his brother.","With Ace's Vivre Card burning up, Luffy looks on in horror. Akainu releases his fist while Ace coughs blood. The pirates are horrified at what Akainu had done to Ace. Kizaru, Aokiji and Garp look on in shock. Whitebeard turns back and sees the horror of Ace mortally wounded. Driven over the edge, the pirates angrily charge at the Marine Admiral. Buggy also looks on helpless. With the Seastone handcuffs too strong to remove from Marco's wrist, they insist on getting Galdino's help.
The pirates fire wildly on Akainu with the people on Sabaody looking on in shock.
However, Akainu recovers walking through the fire with only one arm. The admiral restores his arm and sets his sights on Luffy and Ace preparing another magma fist. Luffy tries to plead for his brother's life and Whitebeard tries to save his crewmate, but Kizaru fires a light blast at the large white-bearded pirate's arm. The yellow-suited vice-admiral reminds Whitebeard that he's become forgetful at his age. Just as Akainu's fist is about to hit, Jinbe blocks the attack willing to sacrifice himself for Ace and Luffy.
Marco then sees that Galdino is unharmed and demands he unlock his cuffs.
Garp decides to walk through his own marines, but Sengoku holds him down. The former tells him to hold him down as he could kill Sakazuki at any moment. While Jinbe recovers his hands, Vista and Marco use Haki-infused attacks on the admiral. Akainu gloats that the marines already won as Ace is finally dying.
Luffy embraces his brother trying to put pressure on the wound, and hopes to get help. But Ace thanks his Luffy for his effort but accepts his life has run its course. Luffy yells for medical assistance, and a doctor races to their side. The wounds are too great as Akainu burned through Ace's internal organs. Luffy calls to Ivankov but there is no hope.
Saddened, the young pirate mourns that Ace once said he would protect him when they were kids and how he wouldn't die.
As the Marines fight more pirates, Luffy believes the fight is not over, and tries to tell Ace to remember his promises. Ace thinks about how he should never have been born and didn't deserve to live. Years ago, some people insulted the young Ace and thought of killing him. Ace stood up to them. A woman named Dadan scolded Ace for trying to hurt people.
Ace says that were it not for Sabo, he would not have a will to live. He tells Luffy to say hi to Dadan for him and thank her for putting up with them. The Straw Hat pirate tries to protest death, but Ace says he won't be around to see Luffy's dream come true and implores him to continue. They also look back on their day how they should enjoy life on the sea without regret.
Ace had lived without regret, and believes things could have been better had he deserved to live. With his voice weakening, Ace tells Luffy and everyone ""Thank you... for caring about someone like me... This good for nothing... This world never wanted..."" Ace cries that his friends loved him and falls forward while life flashes in his eyes. The Vivre Card burns out and Ace dies with a smile but Luffy cries profusely.","Monkey D. Luffy, Portgas D.

Episode 484,Marine Headquarters Collapses! Whitebeard's Silent Rage!,23-Jan-11,"Luffy has a breakdown due to the emotional trauma of Ace's death, causing Jinbe to take him away. The Whitebeard Pirates and their Allies then vow to protect him. An enraged Whitebeard fights Akainu, having his torso pierced through once again, but still defeated the Logia user whilst starting the destruction of Marineford; splitting the ground between him and his sons. Surprisingly, the Blackbeard Pirates appear in Marineford, with their new crew members. Everyone stares in shock at the supposed Impel Down's Level 6 prisoners, as Blackbeard exclaims he is happy to have arrived in time to witness Whitebeard's death.","Ace smiled one last time and passes away, falling from his brother's arms as the last fragment of his vivre card burns away. Luffy remembered when Ace punched him on the head in the past for crying when he thought Ace was dead, after which Ace made a promise not to die and leave his weak little brother alone. Now back in the present, kneeling by his brother's body, Luffy raised his head and howls in mindless grief. 
The Whitebeard Pirates as well as the entire Sabaody are shocked at the death of Ace. Luffy stays still and is unresponsive as Ivankov called out to him - seeing that all the damage Luffy had taken now took its toll, Iva surmises that the shock had collapsed Luffy's mind. Akainu takes the opportunity to once again try to kill Luffy, but Marco intercepted him and yelled at Jinbe to take Luffy away.
Before Akainu can pursue Luffy to finish him off as well, Whitebeard appeared behind him and punched Akainu to the ground, greatly wounding him. Akainu retaliated, burning off a portion of Whitebeard's head. In the anime, Akainu only burns off half of Whitebeard's mustache in one attack, and pierces his torso in another, heavier attack. Surprisingly, this did not faze Whitebeard, who slammed Akainu aside, injuring him further and in the process causing an earthquake that demolished the Marine Headquarters base, and splits the plaza in half. This act separated the Marines and the pirates, isolating Whitebeard with the Marines. Sengoku is astonished that Whitebeard still had so much power while Whitebeard stated he is not finished yet.
The pirates meanwhile retreated to their ships. In the midst of the chaos, the Marines noticed a shadow behind the ruined Marine Headquarters building which reveals itself to be a giant. He was not alone; they noticed more figures on the scaffold of the building. Doflamingo laughed while Whitebeard and Sengoku are less than pleased when they see Blackbeard and his band of pirates, which now included a few new crewmates recruited from Level 6 of Impel Down. Blackbeard laughed as he looked down on Whitebeard, commenting that he was glad he made it in time to see Whitebeard die. Sengoku and Blackbeard threw words at each other, and Blackbeard explained how he used the title of Shichibukai to get what he wanted, which was to break into Impel Down and free the Level 6 prisoners: Sanjuan Wolf, Avalo Pizarro, Vasco Shot, Shiryu, and Catarina Devon.","Monkey D.

Episode 485,Settling the Score - Whitebeard vs. The Blackbeard Pirates,30-Jan-11,"Blackbeard and his pirates arrive in Marineford, as they are taken down from the execution platform by Whitebeard. In order to avenge his two sons (Ace and Thatch), Whitebeard fights Blackbeard. Even with Blackbeard's powers to cancel Devil Fruit abilities, Whitebeard deals a critical blow with his bisento, and then proceeds to pin Blackbeard down, grabs him by the throat, and uses his devil fruit to crush him and throw him back. Teach still survives, and with his crew cowardly attacks Whitebeard using pistols and blades. In his final moments, Whitebeard remembers his last meeting with Roger and his path as a pirate in order to have his family. Whitebeard dies standing, right after telling Blackbeard that he is not the one Roger is waiting for, saying that the will of people like Ace will not die and there will be one that will challenge the world in the future, and then telling the world that One Piece does exist, much to the chagrin of Sengoku.","Blackbeard emerges among the ruins of Marineford, accompanied by his crew and several Level 6 escapees from Impel Down. He begins to fight Whitebeard, who confronts him for his betrayal of the Whitebeard Pirates by murdering Thatch, and his hand in the death of Ace. Whitebeard and Blackbeard clash several times, until Whitebeard then lands a critical blow to Blackbeard and then continues to pin him down and tries to crush his throat. Blackbeard survives and then his crew attacks Whitebeard by using pistols and blades, dealing finishing blows to his already battered body, while his crew looks on in horror and heartbreak.
In Whitebeard's final moments, he thinks about his last meeting with Gol D. Roger and learns the history behind the middle initial ""D"". Gol D. Roger also told Whitebeard how to get to Laugh Tale, even though Whitebeard doesn't ever plan on going there. As Whitebeard is dying, he mentions how the Pirate King awaits someone with the initial ""D"", but tells Teach that he isn't the one that Gol D. Roger is waiting for. He also says that there will be others that will pick up Ace's will and that those flames will never extinguish. Whitebeard then addresses Sengoku and the World Government, acknowledging that they are afraid that one day, a battle will break out that immerses the whole world, and the world will become engulfed in war. Whitebeard admits he doesn't care about the fate of the world, but as long as someone finds Roger's treasure, the world will be turned upside-down, and affirms someone will find it, on a day that will come sooner or later. He grins at Sengoku, who looks on with fright.
Whitebeard tips backward, inhales, gathering his last breath, and bellows at the top of his lungs, ""ONE PIECE... THE ONE PIECE IS REAL"" His words echo throughout all of Marineford, and are heard over the Visual Den Den Mushi and transmitted straight to the viewing public at Sabaody Archipelago. Knowing what impact his final revelation is going to have, Sengoku curses Whitebeard.
As Whitebeard succumbs to his wounds, he thanks his sons and that he was happy that he could sail with all of them for so long. Whitebeard finally passes on, with all his crew members sobbing profusely at the loss of their captain, mourning him without cease. Several Marines on the battlefield stare at him in disbelief, for the great pirate Edward Newgate has died standing up. Even in death, his body refused to collapse. He had so many injuries but he continued to fight, having been inflicted with 267 wounds by swords, 152 wounds by guns, and also being shot with cannons 46 times. However, as his captain's jacket flutters loose from his lifeless body, it becomes clear that out of all these wounds, there is not a single wound on his proud back- in his entire life, Newgate never received a scar from running away.","Little Oars Jr. (K.O.), Avalo Pizarro, Catarina Devon, Laffitte, Stronger, Doc Q, Marshall D.

Episode 486,The Opening of the Show - Blackbeard's Plot Is Revealed,6-Feb-11,"The news of Whitebeard's death is already spreading all over the world. Silvers Rayleigh also hears the news. At Marineford, Teach starts his plan, and his crew cover Whitebeard's corpse with a black curtain, that Teach goes under. The scene changes to Jinbe, who is trying to escape and save Luffy. He flashes back, as he is informed by Vista that he needs to hurry. Down below the cliff, Akainu gets back up, continuing his chase of Luffy. Once above surface, Akainu is stopped from going after Luffy by Ivankov and Inazuma. They can hold their ground, but Akainu refuses to let Luffy get away. Back at the Blackbeard Pirates, they lift the black cloth and Teach shows his darkness powers and his newly gained quake powers. Everybody is shocked, and Blackbeard lets Marineford, pirates, and peace-loving civilians know that this is his era.","Whitebeard is now dead. The people at Sabaody watch in shock. Some civilians learn that with Ace and Whitebeard dead, it will shake the foundation of the world. The news is spread across the world; Ace was killed at Marineford and Whitebeard died in the failed attempt to save him. With the Marines seemingly victorious, some people begin to cheer at this news. Rayleigh also watches bidding Whitebeard a nice journey to the afterlife. As Teach is exhausted, the people learn Whitebeard's real name was Edward Newgate, who stood against Gol D. Roger, had a family of pirates and brought down the walls of Marine Headquarters. But even his superhuman abilities were as nothing before the Admirals and the Shichibukai. Doflamingo cheers at the news and believes Teach to be quite a thinker.
The Sabaody crowd begin to ponder about the One Piece actually existing. With word of Whitebeard's death getting out, they wonder about why Blackbeard is in the equation. Teach takes a few breaths and laughs maniacally at his triumph. Marco is driven over the edge, but Vista insists withdrawal. With the pirates fleeing, Vista advises that Jinbe is not to fall for any distractions whilst caring for the still unconscious Luffy. Jinbe begs forgiveness for his inability to save Ace and Whitebeard, but hopes to keep Luffy from further harm. While the Marines rain cannon fire, Akainu recovers from his battle with Whitebeard and makes a pool of lava. Buggy yells that his plan to assassinate Whitebeard has failed and plans to flee Marineford. The clown pirate was helpless to even try to take Whitebeard by surprise during his fight with Teach. Buggy cries that he wants to spend the rest of his life in a hole in the ground. He decides to abandon his crew, but the former prisoners believe Buggy is teaching them sympathy. They begin to cry over their misfortunes but then chase after Buggy dropping their Den Den Mushi.
Teach was surprised that it took so long to kill Whitebeard then his new crew drapes the deceased pirate in a cape. Teach insists that everyone, the Marines and pirates, watch their spectacle and goes into the cape covering both the dead Whitebeard and Teach. Shiryu knows that if their plan fails, they could disband. Nearing the Marine ships, Jinbe implores Luffy to carry on even without Ace. Jinbe thinks back to what Ace told him at Impel Down. Should he die, Ace asks the Fish-Man to look after his brother. He told Ace that only holds a certain number of people in high regard. Carrying Luffy away, Jinbe feels he found the answer to Ace's request. Hancock had hoped to heal Luffy, but leaves him and Jinbe's care. She uses Perfume Femur kicks to disable some Pacifistas. Hancock also considers pushy men to be an extreme turn off. Just as the Marine ship is near, ice covers the water thanks to Aokiji and lava streaks the ground. Akainu then demands that the pirates all be killed.
Akainu demands that if Luffy is turned over, he may let the others off the hook. Jinbe rejects, determined to protect Luffy. Helmeppo and Koby are horrified that Akainu wants to kill Luffy so badly. As some pirates stand to confront Akainu to avenge Whitebeard, Akainu is annoyed and he says they ran away to leave Ace and Whitebeard to die. The admiral withstands some shots and blasts the pirates while Ivankov deploys Emporio Ganmen Seicho Hormone while Inazuma uses Great Scissors to blockade the lava. Desperate to protect Luffy, Ivankov fires a Hell Wink and believes that Luffy has gone off the deep end since Impel Down. One more mistake and Luffy would die. If that were to happen, Ivankov could never face Dragon again. Akainu insists that Ivankov and Inazuma step aside, but the New Kama Queen tells the former that he is one fire.
Much of Teach's crew are getting impatient to see what Teach has in store for the world. Lafitte announces a grand event to the world and he and Burgess uncover Teach and the lifeless Whitebeard. Blackbeard then says the Shichibukai thing he has put on was fun and decides to go against the Marines. He sucks them into his Black Hole. Teach says in his right hand is his Dark-Dark Fruit power and in his left hand... he punches and causes a tremor like Whitebeard did. As Marineford is crumbling, the Marines worry that eating two Devil Fruits would kill a man, but Teach is somehow able to use two Devil Fruit abilities. Teach's crew is in joy over their captain's newfound power. Having stolen Whitebeard's abilities, Teach will make the world tremble in his every step. Marco realizes that Teach become far beyond normal to use two Devil Fruit powers. Teach announces to all the good-loving people, the pirates and the World Government they must answer to the hand of fate, and fate has chosen Teach to rule the world. Helmeppo is horrified that even with Whitebeard dead, the catastrophe continues with Teach laughing evilly.","Whitebeard (deceased), Silvers Rayleigh, Marshall D.

Even though the Marines clearly won the war, they still fight, and while many die around Koby, the ""voices"" continue to fade away from his mind. For a few moments he bravely stops the war, and as he is about to be killed by Akainu, Shanks arrives, claiming that those ""seconds of courage have changed the fate of the world.""","Buggy carries the unconscious Jinbe and Luffy insulting Law is a doctor armed with a sword. The Marines recognize Law for aiding and abetting in their fight with the World Nobles at Sabaody. Law calls for Buggy to bring the two pirates to him and the clown dodges a cannonball. The Navy ships begin to close in on Law's submarine while Akainu gloats that Luffy may not do any favors even if he survives the day. He could be the undoing of the Whitebeard Pirates. As the admiral fires a Hound Blaze, the crew of Whitebeard give fire while Marco charges the lava hound. More Marines are deployed to get the remaining Whitebeard Pirates as well as the Blackbeard pirates.
As the pirate continue to fight the Marines, Sengoku fires another shockwave hitting Teach hard. Koby drops clutching his head and begins to have horrible visions of pirates killing Marines and vice versa. Teach recovers and plans to sink all of Marineford. Sengoku vows to kill Teach, but the black-bearded pirate stops the shockwave with a tremor. Burgess moves for an attack, but Garp stops the attack showing loyalty to the Marines. Teach begins to grab at the sky. With the Navy ships getting dangerously close, Bepo yells Jean Bart for ordering him around. As the Navy guns fire, Teach swings his hands down, but the ocean shakes making the Marines miss their target. It is not just Marineford, it is the sky and ocean that is shaking violently. Some Navy and pirate ships are swallowed by the waves while Teach shows joy in his work.
Akainu gives chase to Buggy but is blocked by Vista's party. While Koby cries in despair, Teach needs to learn how to control his new tremor powers. Burgess insists they wait until the crew leaves, but Sengoku believes Teach has gone mad. Teach retorts that playing nice is as nothing.
Then at Sabaody, sirens wail and a tsunami is coming. The people are to leave for Groves 40 through 50.
At Marineford, more Pacifistas are deployed and the Marines begin to overwhelm the pirates. Some of the remaining Whitebeard pirates decide to reject the last order and begin to fight to the death. When the shaking stops, Koby begins to feel sadness. More pirates and Marines are killing each other left and right.
As the order to kill everybody is given, Tashigi tries to tend to an injured marine. She learns the pirates want revenge. Smoker withstands some shots and believes this pointless fights are injustice. Koby is off the deep end thinking of the times he spent with Luffy.
While Akainu strikes down Curiel, he orders the Marines to show no mercy. Koby trips over a dead marine and tries to wake him up, but finds a necklace. He finds a picture of the dead Marine's family.
As Teach yells that there might no one to challenge him, Kizaru fires a light blast at Buggy daring him to come and face him. With insufficient time, Buggy throws Jinbe and Luffy to Jean Bart. With Luffy's injuries far worse than Sabaody, Kizaru prepares to finish Luffy once and for all. Koby yells that it's enough.
Koby reasons that the fighting is done and the Marines are victorious. The young marine calls out that all Marines have families and questions that the Marines need to prove. Akainu tells him to leave and is wasting time. Sensing that Koby does not believe in justice, Akainu moves to execute Koby but a sword stops him. Everyone watches in shock. It was Shanks who stopped the fatal blow, and he says that Koby's speech will change the world whether for better or worse.

Episode 489,Enter Shanks! The Ultimate War Ends at Last,6-Mar-11,"Law and his crew take Jinbe and Luffy inside their submarine. As they are both put on the operation table, Buggy yells at Shanks for lying about the treasure map. When Buggy is cooled down and praised by his followers, Shanks threatens Blackbeard. As both crews face down each other, Teach's side decides to leave. Shanks then declares that Ace's and Whitebeard's dead bodies should be given a proper burial by the pirates. Sengoku agrees and the war ends with the marines announcing their victory to the world.","Shanks stands firm before Akainu while Garp recognizes the former for corrupting his grandson into being a pirate. Almost all the pirates and Marines are surprised, while an amused Teach catches notice. The Red-Haired Pirates had arrived. While Law's submarine sails away, his crew members race to save Luffy and Jinbe who are rapidly losing blood. As they prepare for transfusion, Bepo reminds his captain they need to go underwater soon. The Marines learn that Shanks' crew had a run-in with one of the other Four Emperors, Kaido, yesterday. Buggy freaks out at seeing Shanks, as the latter is surprised to see him but the clown pirate doesn't want to be in Shanks' presence. Shanks throws his straw hat to Buggy for the clown to loan to Luffy. The clown pirate yells that he doesn't want anymore favors from the red-haired pirate. Shanks also says he has got a treasure map that could suit Buggy fancy. When Shanks moves to give the map to another, Buggy quickly decides to comply to his former crewmate's request and get the Straw Hat to Luffy. Lucky Roux wonders if Shanks is going to let Luffy leave without a chance to greet him.
With their times flying by, Shanks thinks back to his first meeting with Luffy, and how he sacrificed his arm to save him from the Sea King. He begins to wonder what Luffy would say at their moment. Bepo calls to Law for attention as they don't want the Marines to hit their submarine hard, or for the captain to drown. Buggy then races with the Straw Hat and slings it into Law's hand. The pirate surgeon and Bepo head inside the submarine and it begins to submerge. With the two racing to Luffy's side, Shanks knows that his reunion with Luffy will have to wait. He also thinks back to when he gave his Straw Hat to Luffy and expects it returned in good condition and will meet whence Luffy becomes a great pirate. Once the submarine submerges, Shanks says he can't see Luffy again just yet. Law begins his operation as Akainu ran both Jinbe and Luffy through, but is more worried about the emotional scars that Luffy has suffered.
Meanwhile, Akainu curses Shanks for allowing Luffy's escape while his comrades are determined to finish Luffy with Aokiji firing an Ice Age, threatening to freeze the water. With Luffy's pulse steadying, the submarine is struck, but Jean Bart makes the submarine go full speed for a dive. Just as the ice is inches from giving the submarine a fatal blow, it evades. Bepo breathes a sigh of relief. However, Kizaru fires a Yasakani Sacred Jewel shower, rocking the submarine heavily. Hancock tries to protest. When he stops, the light admiral says that if Law's group survived, luck may not be on the side of the Marines. Hancock hijacks a Marine ship and tells the crew she will capture Luffy on her authority as a Warlord. Shanks stares at the horizon as Luffy leaves the area.
Buggy lashes out at Shanks as the treasure map was all a trick. The Red Haired Pirate Captain says he was just having fun with his old friend and is happy to see him again. The Clown pirate reacts angrily to this and reminds Shanks that if he hadn't spotted him with the Bara Bara no Mi or the map, he would not lose it. Buggy yells that Shanks is a prodigy when it comes to making him angry. He also declares war on Shanks, as his impressed followers internally promise to serve him forever. Shanks leaves Buggy to handle his business with the war, as Buggy protests this but soon realizes he could hitch a ride with Shanks' crew to safely leave Marineford.
Shanks walks past Marco, informing him that there is no further need for combat and he must resign. Mihawk walks past the Marines as they protest, he firmly tells them while he agreed to fight Whitebeard's crew, Shanks was another matter telling the Marines to quit and he leaves the area. Shanks warns to everyone present on Marineford that their fighting is becoming pointless. Every blow one party lands, it goes back to their own as well. He draws his sword as he tells them that if anyone wants another fight, the red-haired pirate dares the pirates and marines to fight him. The Marines are in shock, while Teach's crew stands in idle. Shanks confronts Teach and asks if he wants to escalate things. An amused Teach compliments Shanks for the scars that he left on Shanks' eye. Just as both crews prepare to duel, Teach laughs as he announces to his crew to resign. He declares he already had what he wanted and doesn't wish for another fight with Shanks, at least not yet. The Blackbeard pirates pull out and leave the area.
Sengoku shifts back to his human form and Shanks sheathes his sword. With Ace and Whitebeard dead, Shanks tells everyone to accept the losses, honor the fallen and leave with their dignity intact. Whitebeard's crew mourn the loss of their captain and the Marines tend to their fallen. At Sabaody, Reuder remarks that the war seems to be ending.
Shanks requests that Ace and Whitebeard be given a proper burial and doesn't want their corpses paraded through like trophies. With the Marines ultimately victorious, they want to string their dead enemies up as proof of their triumph. However, Sengoku consents and allows Shanks to give Ace and Whitebeard the proper burial, something that the pirate thanks. Sengoku then orders the injured to be tended to and announces the war is finally over. As the wounded are gathered, Garp orders the soldiers not to lose anymore good men while he sheds tears at his loss.
Shanks then looks upon the bodies of Ace and Whitebeard as he sadly looks on.","Shanks, Monkey D. Garp, Akainu, Sengoku, Vasco Shot, Jesus Burgess, Doc Q, Stronger, Marshall D.

Elsewhere, in the backstreets of Marineford, Gecko Moria is being attacked by Pacifistas commanded by Donquixote Doflamingo, who states that Moria is too weak to continue being a Warlord of the Sea, and that it would be better if the people believed he died in the war. When Moria angrily demands if this was Sengoku's order, Donquixote told him to try higher. Meanwhile, the other Supernovas (except Luffy and Zoro) were witnessing the whole Marineford fight from their ships far away. Scratchmen Apoo questions why Trafalgar Law, known for his brutality, would save Monkey D. Luffy and states there must be some catch. Hawkins thinks it is odd that the odds of Luffy being alive never reaches zero.

The bandits began fighting over food, and the young rubber boy didn't get a piece of meat.
Curly Dadan explained her bandit gang's story, while Ace was eating. All the meat was from the bison that Ace had taken down. The bandit woman expected Luffy to work hard and told him to grow up fast. The straw hatted boy told he could survive in the jungle and hoped to be a pirate. He followed Ace outside.
Luffy chased Ace introducing himself and is not mad for being spat on. He wanted to be friends, but Ace knocked a tree down and sent it rolling to Luffy. In the Corvo jungle, Ace was crossing a bridge when Luffy caught up. The red shirted boy smacked Luffy and he fell into a gorge.
When Ace returned, he had just caught a fish and didn't say where Luffy was. Dogra and Magra worried for Luffy's condition and were concerned about Garp's reaction. Curly drunkly said that Luffy should look after himself. Ace thought back on how the other pirates mocked his biological father. Dadan decided to expel Ace as he is the devil's son.
A week later, while the bandits rested, Dadan was called up and Luffy was seen alive and well. The straw hatted boy said he was chased by wolves. The next morning, Luffy continued to chase Ace and ignored the chores Dadan wanted him to do. Ace began to run off while Luffy followed suit. Luffy is nearly eaten by crocs.

As he is sinking, an enormous crocodile appears and swallows Luffy whole. Ace and Sabo get angry and defeat the crocodile in order to rescue Luffy.

Back at Mt. Colubo, the Dadan Family is discussing over what should be done about Luffy and company starting a conflict with the Bluejam Pirates. They say things such as the Dadan Family is done for, or that they will just all get massacred, which angers Dadan and leads her to end up saying that if the Bluejams indeed do come here, they'll just turn them in. A member says that even if they turn them in, Bluejam won't be satisfied, so the end solution for them ends up being to just feign ignorance. Dadan decides to practice, but they end up being so terrible at lying that she admits that it's hopeless. The episode ends with Luffy returning with Ace, Sabo, and the crocodile.","Portgas D.

Later, Sabo explained to Ace and Luffy that he was in fact a noble. Ace, Sabo, and Luffy became brothers by sharing a drink together.","Sabo, Luffy, and Ace continued their adventures and grew stronger day by day. They beat up a crocodile and then dressed up as a seller of Grey Terminal going into the Goa Kingdom pretending to be selling crocodile leather for the nobles to the guards. They beat up some thugs and thieves on their way to the nobles and they realized it was the three kids. When they get inside the city, every noble was disgusted by their disguise for being so dirty. They sold the crocodile for a lot of money. They then headed straight to a restaurant to eat ramen.
The manager of the restaurant refused to let them inside the restaurant, but Sabo gave him a precious jewel, a bribe that immediately changed the owner's mind. After being taken to their own private room, they relaxed and ate a lot of food. When the waiter girl became tired of delivering the extra servings to them, she went inside the room and saw a long hand stretching and grabbing the bowls from her hands. Scared by this, she reported back to the manager. When the manager and the waiter girl checked inside to see more, they witnessed the three kids greedily eating the ramen bowls. Seeing they were caught, Luffy, Sabo, and Ace smashed through the window, jumped out of the building, and made a run for it. While running, a noble called Sabo by his name, which confused Luffy and Ace. Ace asked Sabo for an explanation only to see his friend deny everything and state that the noble had mistaken him for someone else.
When they arrived at Grey Terminal, Ace and Luffy convinced Sabo to tell them what Sabo was hiding from them. Sabo told them that he was in fact a noble. Luffy and Ace were more confused and both poked their nose. Sabo then decided to tell the truth. He had been born from a noble called Outlook III and his wife. As a small child, his parents had urged him to study a lot and come top at his exams so that he could marry the royal family's daughter, in order to get wealth, fame, and a higher status. Sabo had wondered if that would make him happy and they had replied yes, lying to him. Sabo had become an intelligent and brilliant student. He had studied a lot believing that he would eventually be happy.
One day, while his father was occupied working hard, Sabo came to him and showed him a picture he had drawn to see his father's opinion. In anger, his father tore the drawing up and told him to go study, which made Sabo feel really sad. To make matters worse, he had a fight with the royal family's son who had used a knife to beat him. Sabo got injured and so did the royal son. Sabo said to his mother he was injured from a knife and he started it but his mother ignored it and slapped him. Realizing that they were using him, Sabo went to a new place known as Grey Terminal where everybody was free and fun-loving and had no worries. Sabo went there day by day and eventually loved that place and spent most of his time there. This led to his grades dropping significantly. His father noticed it and told him to never go to that ""stinky and rotten"" place again. Sabo could not agree with that order and eventually escaped from home and started living there.
So this was the life story of Sabo. Ace then vowed to the two of his friends that he would become such a pirate one day, everybody would know his name. Sabo also vowed that too, but much to their surprise, Luffy told them that he would become Pirate King. Ace and Sabo both mocked Luffy afterwards. Ace then brought three cups and a stolen bottle of sake from Curly Dadan and told them that if men drink together, they become brothers, so the three boys did, officially becoming ""brothers"".","Monkey D.

After completing one circle around Marineford, the three disembark onto the island, with Jinbe and Rayleigh distracting the Marines while Luffy runs to the Ox Bell. While news reporters and other bystanders watch him, Luffy rings the bell sixteen times. He then dropped a bouquet of flowers into the largest crack in the ground, put his straw hat to his chest, and closed his eyes. The reporters excitedly photographed the incident, before Luffy, Rayleigh, and Jinbe leave the island.
In a meeting between Fleet Admiral Sengoku and Commander-in-Chief Kong at an unknown location, Sengoku tells his superior that he wants to retire from the Marines, and nominates Aokiji as his replacement. Koby wakes up in hospital, and learns that he now possesses the skill of Haki. Captain Smoker decided to go to the New World to go after Luffy, and asks Aokiji for a transfer to G-5. In the New World, Hawkins is seen being challenged by the pirate Brownbeard, and Eustass Kid is shown killing another pirate crew for displaying weakness and wishing to return to Paradise.","The episode started with a view of Marineford being rebuilt. It showed a room full of vice-admirals as Lieutenant Commander Brannew talked about how Luffy is revealed to have survived the Summit War of Marineford and caused trouble again. A flashback followed, showing what happened two days ago. Two reporters are seen talking about how the Marines will go after the pirates involved in the war. Suddenly, some Marines see the warship which Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh are on. They made a full circle around Marineford before entering the bay (which is done in a funeral). After that, all three of them got to the plaza. Luffy then ran toward the Ox Bell and rang it sixteen times. Afterwards, he went to the largest crack from the battle in the ground and dropped a bouquet of flower in it and held his hat to his chest in a manner of paying respect. Reporters who were at the scene excitedly took photographs of the incident. Soon afterwards, a huge whale-shark appeared in the bay as Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh escaped from Marineford. After that, the newspapers printed the story and delivered it to all around the world, including Water 7, Sabaody Archipelago, Arabasta, and Foosha Village. The flashback ends as Brannew stated that it is humiliating for them to have let Luffy go.
After that there was a scene showing the Five Elders discussing who should fill the vacancies in the Shichibukai positions and that Blackbeard was turning out to be a lot of trouble. They also comment on how those with the ""D"" are beginning to stir up trouble at the same time.
The next scene showed World Government Commander-in-Chief Kong and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku discussing Sengoku's retirement. Sengoku also recommended Admiral Aokiji to be the next Fleet Admiral.
The scene changed to Koby, Helmeppo, and a doctor in the hospital, discussing how Koby has obtained Observation Haki. Koby, talking within himself states that he feels different with this new power and he has to train more to become stronger; as strong as ""him"" (""him"" referring to Luffy).
After that, Admiral Aokiji and Smoker talked about what Luffy did at Marineford and about Smoker's transfer to the Marine base G-5.
In the New World, Eustass Kid and his crew were talking about Luffy's actions. Kid asked what the Ox Bell is. Killer explained what it is and the reason he thinks why Luffy rang it sixteen times.
The scene changes to Capone Bege's ship, which was being pulled up to a huge black ball in the sky, and Urouge's ship, which was approaching an island that was constantly being hit by lightning. An old woman offered to sell the crew some umbrellas. It then goes back to Kid as he declared that he will defeat Luffy in the New World.","Brannew, Whitebeard (flashback), Akainu (flashback), Kizaru (flashback), Aokiji, Monkey D.

Episode 512,Reach to My Friends - The Big News Comes Through!,28-Aug-11,"Some of Luffy's old friends from Impel Down and around the world read the news about Luffy's second appearance at Marineford. The Rosy Life Riders fight off the Coffee Monkeys to prevent them from capturing the Thousand Sunny. Luffy, Rayleigh, and Jinbe are being led by the Kuja Pirates to Luffy's training place, while the Straw Hat Pirates receive the news about Luffy.","On an island in the Grand Line, Buggy's crew is crying and lamenting how much they have missed their captain. Buggy is also crying and lamenting that he had missed them so much and was stating how they had so much trust in him to wait for him. Alvida commented to herself saying that those guys (Buggy's crew) had given up on him a long time ago. Then Mohji, Cabaji, and Richie introduced themselves to the new crew of prisoners that escaped with Buggy from Impel Down. Alvida, somewhat impressed by Buggy's actions commented that the prisoners he brought with him were heinous prisoners with high bounties. After this, Buggy showed her Captain John's treasure mark. Buggy then told her that Luffy gave it to him, boasting that the wind does not blow east or west but blows directly to him. Alvida then informs Buggy about Luffy's current escapade in Marineford. Buggy seemed very confused after reading the paper, about Luffy's connection to Rayleigh, commenting that Rayleigh might be Luffy's uncle. At this point, Mr. 3 tells Buggy that he (Buggy) has received a letter from the World Government. Mr. 3 went on to read the letter and was completely surprised by what it said.
Next, at Sabaody Archipelago GR 44, the Coffee Monkeys request the Rosy Life Riders to hand over the Thousand Sunny to them, hoping to receive a lot of money from the Marines. They also say that if Duval's crew hand over the ship, they would split the profit with them since they are in the same business. In response, Duval kicks the Coffee Monkeys away, saying that he will not hand over the ship. Shakky, also present, states that they have to protect the ship. It is around this time that Bartholomew Kuma appears. Shakky tells them not to panic saying that Kuma has been around to see Rayleigh before and asks Kuma if he is on their side.
Next, at Alubarna in the Kingdom of Arabasta, Pell and Chaka had just finished chasing away some pirates from a port. Pell stated that they are tightening the kingdom's security since the activities of pirates have increased after Whitebeard's death. Cobra commented on how he wished every pirate were like Luffy. Pell went ahead to ask the king if he had taken a look at the newspaper and Igaram replied saying that Vivi was very happy to see that Luffy and the rest were safe. However, Cobra indicated that after a few seconds her happiness changed into perplexity and took the paper to her room. In Vivi's room, she was questioning what was on Luffy's arm; whether it were numbers, marks, or some new fashion. But she was unable to come up with an answer.
An island where Crocodile was staying is shown next. He was reading the newspaper and commenting that it has been three weeks since the war and barely escaping death, he was wondering what they (Luffy, Jinbe, and Rayleigh) were up to. Daz Bonez answered saying they were either up to something or just crazy. Crocodile then mentioned that he was healed and was heading back to the New World. He asked Daz if he would accompany him, and he agreed.
The news spread around the world and people were shown receiving it in Luffy's hometown, the dojo where Zoro used to train, Nami's village (with her sister and Genzo reading the paper), the Baratie restaurant, Drum Island (with Dr. Kureha and Dalton reading the paper), the Franky Family, Iceburg, and Paulie in Water 7, and the Dadan Family who went up to the front of Ace and Luffy's old treehouse, crying out to Ace that his brother whom he died saving is alive and he should rest in peace.
Next, Luffy is shown on the Kuja Pirates' ship apologizing to the girls about the long journey. They responded that they are used to long travels. They keep pulling on his skin while telling him that they have to make sure he is resting as per their captain's orders. Luffy worries, wondering if his crew would get the message. Rayleigh told him not to worry and that they would understand the message; although there was one amongst them who seemed dull, he (Rayleigh) was sure the guy would eventually understand the message.
The crew members are then shown. Chopper is sitting on the back of one of the birds from Torino Kingdom as he exclaimed to Luffy that he understands the message. Robin is in a horse-drawn carriage, acknowledging the hidden instruction as she understands Luffy's message. Sanji, in the Kamabakka Kingdom was shown next as he also indicates that he understood Luffy's message. After failing to leave the Boin Archipelago once again, Usopp is stuffing his face when a newspaper fell on the ground. Upon reading the paper, he also shows that he understood Luffy's message. In Weatheria, Nami is trying to run away when Haredas came up behind her stating that the balloon terminal was closed and they should return to his place for the time being. He pointed to the newspaper and Nami, upon reading it, understands the hidden message. She also comments on how selfish Luffy was for deciding on his own without thinking of how their feelings again. On Karakuri Island, Franky, survived the explosion, though he had been heavily damaged by the explosion caused from accidentally self-destructing Vegapunk's lab. He exclaims that he understood the message from Luffy. Next up is Brook, appearing to be in jail while muttering to himself how he needed to get out of the situation he is in. The newspaper he had requested is given to him by one of his captors and upon reading it, he understands the message as well. Lastly, Zoro is shown in Kuraigana Island with Perona scolding him. She then tells Zoro about the newspaper she had and how it has an update on Luffy. With difficulty in moving, Zoro demands to see the news and tries his best to decode the meaning of it while Perona holds the paper. He knows that Luffy going back to Marineford is not something his captain would do, deducting that it has to be Rayleigh's idea. He explains that there has to be a catch to it, but is still unable to immediately find the hidden message, which Rayleigh had alluded to earlier.","Mohji, Cabaji, Richie, Tightrope Walking Funan Bros, Superhuman Domingos, Buggy, Alvida, Monkey D.

Meanwhile X Drake is on a winter island somewhere in the New World. When he and his crew are attacked by some icicles, they start to run back. Suddenly, a massive iron dome opens up, revealing a hidden city and a huge cyborg shoots at them and states that he is a guardian, along with many others. Drake asks the robot whether attacking him would get Kaido's attention; the robot informs him that it would. So Drake transforms into his Ancient Zoan form and prepares to fight it.
At the same time on another island, Apoo fights off a giant wild boar. Just when he thinks the battle is over, a hoard of giant wild boars stampedes towards him. Apoo and his crew run towards the cliff and—much to their astonishment—rather than falling off, they find themselves running in the air with the wild boars still behind them.
On another island the Blackbeard Pirates had won against the Bonney Pirates and want to exchange Jewelry Bonney with the Marines because they don't have a ship. But then Van Augur sees that Admiral Akainu is commanding the Marines' ship and they run away rather than risking to get caught by him.

Meanwhile, the old men catch up to Nami. She eventually confronts the old men. She then proceeds to trick the group, going on how one of the old men suggested that they strip her and beat her.

She takes off her shoes and sets them down in front of her, apparently preparing to throw herself into the ocean. Nami gets up and rushes towards the cliffside of the island while ""crying"". The old men quickly try to stop her and apologize. Nami then stops before she reaches the island's edge and quickly forgives the old men, leaving them teetering on the cliff. She rushes back to Haredas in a full sprint, despite panting heavily and her bare feet smacking against the pavement. Suddenly full of determination, she remembers how Luffy helped her when she had been oppressed by Arlong and had tried to gouge out her old Arlong Pirates tattoo. She goes with Haredas to back to his house, who has been sitting watch by her shoes in bafflement of what she just did. Nami then begs Haredas to teach her everything about the Weather ball and weather navigation, remembering all that Luffy did for her. Haredas, after Nami explains her situation to him, agrees.
Meanwhile, Franky, on Karakuri Island, has suffered considerable damage to his cyborg body by accidentally pressing the self-destruct button in Dr. Vegapunk's lab. After being caught directly in the following explosion, most of his artificial skin has been scorched away, which has left a lot of his internal iron framework exposed and Franky unintentionally quite scary-looking. Though the main lab is gone, he discovers a second, hidden lab of Dr. Vegapunk, where he finds hidden blueprints of the scientist's weapons and Devil Fruit research. He tells Kitton, his grandfather, and Taroimo that he will be staying in the lab to study the blueprints and asks them to bring him some cola every now and then. However, the three are still freaked out by Franky's burnt appearance. Franky eventually gets annoyed by this and puts on a tiger rug. He then lights a fire in the lab's fireplace and remembers his dream. He vows that he will get stronger and will learn how to make the Thousand Sunny the ship of dreams. However, the tiger rug catches fire and Franky quickly runs out of the lab, scaring the marines searching for him, and creating the ""Legend of the Sacred Burning Beast of Baldimore"".

Sanji quickly notices the impact of the food on his body and asks Ivankov about it. Ivankov quickly tells Sanji about the Attack Cuisine. Sanji is amazed about the recipe, thinking about how he could make his friends stronger through their daily meals. Although, he quickly wonders about if it would make Robin and Nami sexier, either way, he asks Ivankov to teach him the recipe for this wondrous dish. However, Ivankov quickly rejects Sanji's request. After some talk, Ivankov makes Sanji a deal—if he beats the 99 masters of New Kama Kenpo, Sanji will have the right to learn the recipe of the Attack Cuisine. However, along the way, the Okamas will try to put Sanji in a dress and force him to be an okama again.

The latter finally meet a rather distressed Chopper, who has been wondering why his friends had become so cold-hearted and what he had trained for in the past two years.

He then remembers about Robin and tells his friends to hurry and save her, but Usopp and Nami inform him about the people he met earlier being imposters, much to his surprise.

Luffy and the others (but mostly Sanji) are excited to meet Camie after two long years.
Camie explains how she was going to meet them, but she thought it was a month later until then. Either way, Camie is happy to see everyone and gives everyone some soup. Camie then freaks out, realizing that she was trying to warm everyone up with cold soup, she and Usopp engage in an odd shocked face fault, while everyone else eats the soup. After some talking, the Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets come by and give the group their clothes back, all dried. Camie introduces the quintuplets and tells the group that they are in the girls dorms of the Mermaid Cove, which gets Sanji all riled up. Eventually, the group leaves Camie's apartment and heads for a higher level of the island on a sea turtle.
Luffy asks Camie about Hatchan and Pappag, to which she explains that Hatchan is recovering in the Fish-Man District and that Pappag is a famous designer living in a high-class mansion. Camie then shows off the bubble roads to the group as they make their way into an air-filled area of the island.

The New Fishman Pirates follow, after being told to bring the Straw Hat Pirates to their boss. The Neptune Brothers arrive in search of the Straw Hats, but Sanji suffers from a near-fatal nosebleed causing the Straw Hats and Camie to quickly leave in search of a blood donor. After the Straw Hats and Camie leave, The Neptune Brothers reveal to Camie's friends that they were attempting to pass on a message from Jinbe to the Straw Hat Pirates.","The episode begins with an infatuated Sanji playing in a pool with the mermaids in Mermaid Cove. The chef states his wish to live there, with a mermaid remarking how much fun he is. Luffy, soaking his feet on the side of the pool, comments on how nice it must be to swim. Camie suggests that Luffy could wear a bubble in order to do so, much to his surprise. Usopp asks if Sanji is just acting the way he is out of nature. Chopper states that he is glad Sanji is back to normal, going on to say that his blood stock is out of Sanji's blood type, S RH-, an exceedingly rare blood type. Luffy tells Camie there is someone on the island he wants to meet. Camie asks if it is the Mermaid Princess, Luffy says it is not, and that he wants to see Jinbe, explaining how Jinbe helped him cope with the loss of his brother, Ace. Usopp asks if Luffy is referring to the ex-Shichibukai, to which Luffy replies with a yes, calling him his friend, much to Usopp's disbelief. Luffy then remembers Jinbe saying that he would wait for Luffy at Fish-Man Island and tells Camie about it. Camie remembers reading an article where Luffy and Jinbe were seen together.
When Luffy asks where he is, Camie replies that he is not on the island, going on to explain that after Jinbe abdicated his Shichibukai status, he could no longer stay on Fish-Man Island, so he and the Fish-Man Pirates had to leave. Luffy then asks if that meant that he will not be able to see him, and Camie explains that the details of his departure are complicated, and that after the war, a lot of things have changed on Fish-Man Island.
They are interrupted by the Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets, who come to tell them that a ship is coming. Nika, one of the quintuplets, tells Camie that it is a rare kingdom ship. Camie realizes that the ship might be coming to arrest Luffy, and tells the crew that they must hide. Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper all hide behind rocks, while Sanji, still in the water, is shielded from view by Ishilly, who is trying to tell him to hold still while hugging his head to her chest, which the chef appeared to enjoy immensely. The ship, identified by Camie as a royal gondola, essentially a large oarfish with some sort of carriage with oars sticking out built into it, approaches them. A nearby mermaid does not believe that there could actually be royalty aboard it, wondering why would they come from Ryugu Palace to this little corner of the island. Trumpets are then heard, heralding the arrival of the princes of Ryugu Kingdom, the Neptune brothers. One of them greets the mermaids, saying he has a question for them. Three mermaids shriek with joy at the sight of the princes, asking them why they are there while Luffy, hidden behind a nearby rock, quietly looks on.
He then wonders why there would be princes at Mermaid Cove, as do Usopp and Chopper. The Neptune princes, Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi, and Manboshi, then come forth. Fukaboshi explains that they received a report of illegal entry, asking if anyone had come by there. The mermaids reply that no one has come by. One asks if the people they are looking for really are important enough for the three princes to look for them in person. Fukaboshi then states that they have not confirmed if the illegal entrants are the people they are looking for.
From a distance, Hammond is watching these events take place. He is with a Fish-Man and a sea monster. Hammond wonders why they are at the cove, saying it could be problematic. Fukaboshi then thanks the mermaids for their time, saying that he will continue searching elsewhere and that the border patrol must have made a mistake. He then apologizes to the mermaids for taking up their time, to which they reply that it was not any trouble at all. His brothers apologize as well. At this point, Sanji loses all self-control. The ability to contain himself became too much while his head was clutched against Ishilly's chest, and he erupts in his most massive nosebleed ever. The blood spurted extremely high, taking the shape of a mermaid doing a sexy pose. Chopper yells out in shock as he runs toward him. The mermaid holding him screams not knowing what just happened. The bottom half of Sanji's face is completely covered in blood and there is a lot more of it in the water. Luffy remarks that Sanji just lost a dangerous amount of blood. Usopp realizes that Sanji could not handle the excitement after all, and keeping it suppressed caused him to explode like this. Fukaboshi, checking some of the crew's wanted posters, realizes that the person he is seeing now must be Monkey D. Luffy. He then orders his Ammo Knights to advance. Hammond realizes that the Straw Hat Pirates are there now too. Hammond says that it would be bad if they got into a fight with the Neptune Army and decides not to do anything for now.
Chopper runs to Sanji's side, telling the guards to wait a moment while apologizing for entering illegally and asking the guards to postpone their arrest. He then asks for someone to donate blood, saying that if Sanji will not be treated, he would die in about an hour. Chopper said Sanji's blood type is S RH-, an extremely rare blood type. He asks if anyone could donate some and asks if fish-man or merman blood could be transfused into a human's body. The guards stop in surprise. Luffy then begs for someone to give Sanji some blood. As some mermaids look on in fear, Chopper asks again if anyone has the necessary blood type. Usopp finishes the plea by saying that they cannot let Sanji die in such a stupid way. Camie tells Chopper that humans, mermen, and Fish-Men all share the same blood and that it is transfusable. She is about to explain more but is interrupted by Hammond's laughter. He tells the Straw Hat Pirates that they must be out of their minds and that there is not a single creature on the island who would give blood to humans and if someone did they would get a ""judgment in the dark"" from someone who hates humans. Luffy then recognizes Hammond from their earlier encounter as Camie suddenly dives under the water.
One of the guards tells Fukaboshi that the person talking is Hammond from the Fish-Man District. Hammond tells Sanji to stay bleeding as he is and to die helplessly. He then tells about the rule put in place long ago, forbidding fish-men and humans from sharing blood. Usopp and Luffy look at him in disbelief. Hammond goes on to explain that the rule, ironic to the situation, was put in place by humans, fearing the fish-men as monsters, to prevent the mixing of bloodlines.
Hammond then ordered them to abandon the life of one crew member and come with them to the Fish-Man District, as their boss, Hody Jones, wished to see them. Usopp then shouted that he did not know the detail of that law, and that if someone with S RH- blood came forth to help, he would thank them in any way possible. Hammond, ignoring Usopp, remarks that they will just have to take the Straw Hat Pirates by force. He shoots a Trawl Net from a gun at them. Luffy sweeps the flying net out of the way, saying he would not listen to Hammond and that he had told him this earlier. He then proceeds to knock out Hammond and his accomplices with one Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol each. Fukaboshi and some mermaids look on in shock. Hammond and the two other pirates have been knocked out cold. Usopp then yells that there's a sea monster behind Luffy. Luffy dispatches the monster by using Haoushoku Haki, intimidating it enough so that it would not fight, but not enough to faint. Chopper and Usopp were shocked at how the monster realized its own defeat without actually fighting. Fukaboshi does not seem phased by this, though says that it was impressive. Camie then reappears, having hijacked the royal gondola. She tells them that they should go into town, as she saw a lot of humans at the port. Camie then apologizes to the guards, promising to return the giant oarfish to them once they are done with it. Once everyone is on board, they set off, leaving everyone else, including the princes, at Mermaid Cove. On the gondola, Camie apologizes, saying she would be willing to help if she were the right blood type for Sanji, but she is not. Usopp tells her that she has nothing to be sorry for, as it all goes back to Sanji having impure thoughts, pointing out the smirk on the chef's face as evidence. Chopper tells Sanji not to think of anything, as every second is precious.
Back at Mermaid Cove, Fukaboshi is talking to the Mermaids, saying them covering for the pirates created a huge mistake, asking them why they did it. The mermaids apologize, saying that the pirates were not bad people and friends of Camie's and that they did not want the crew to get arrested for illegal entry. One mermaid says she hopes Sanji will be alright. Fukaboshi told the mermaids that they were jumping to conclusions. Since the Straw Hat Pirates are already infamous pirates, it did not matter if they entered illegally since the army more or less knew who they were dealing with. Ryuboshi adds that they were looking for them for a different reason and also states that they had just lost their chance to give the Straw Hats a message from Jinbe.","Hammond, Hyouzou, Kasagoba, Nami, Franky, Nico Robin, Sanji, Ishilly, Seira, Mero, Sora, Fillonce, Hiramera, Lulis, Kairen, Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Camie, Monkey D.

Episode 529,Fish-Man Island Collapses?! Shyarly's Prediction,25-Dec-11,"As blood donors are finally found, the recovering Sanji stays at the Mermaid Cafe while Luffy, Usopp, and Camie meet Pappag and Brook. The five of them head for Pappag's home. In the meantime, Ishilly and her friends vanish after opening the barrel that was washed up together with the Straw Hats and the episode ends with Madam Shyarly predicting that Luffy would destroy Fish-Man Island.","The episode starts with Luffy and the others looking for a blood donor. Unfortunately, none of the fish-men they passed volunteered. After splitting up, Chopper spots humans going into a bar and calls the others.
Meanwhile, Ishilly and a couple of friends discovered the barrel Franky trapped Caribou in, which floated in with Luffy and the others. Thinking there might be treasure or alcohol in it, they prepare to open it. Back at Luffy's group, Sanji wakes up after having received donated blood. He asks where he is and Camie tells him he is at her friend's house. Chopper collapses face first on the bed, saying how happy he is to have found donor blood. Sanji, confused by Chopper's talk about blood, sits up while asking what happened. Camie quickly tells him to lie back down. Luffy, sprawled out in a chair, asks why no Fish-Man would help them, saying they had been all over the island, going on to say he thought Sanji was a goner. Sanji, touched by his friends' selflessness, thanks them. He then tries to remember what happened to put him in such a state, but has difficulty with it. Luffy and Usopp implore him to stop remembering, as he will lose blood again and there would be nothing they could do to help him again.
Usopp points to a curtain where only a hand is visible, saying they found the donor at a pub. From behind the curtain, Sanji hears a feminine voice. He then asks if they took the blood from a fragile young lady. Usopp pulls back the curtain to reveal two okama, the pirate twins Splash and Splatter. One of them even offers him more blood if it is necessary. Sanji screams and foams at the mouth in shock. While Usopp is telling Sanji to thank them, Chopper realizes that Luffy had been poisoned, noticing the entry point on his arm. Chopper is amazed at how Luffy did not react at all to such a deadly poison and that he already had antibodies to counter it. Luffy remembers Magellan's poison almost killing him in Impel Down and gives that as the reason for his immunity. Luffy remembers the merman with the sword and the octopus legs, and attributes the poison to him, saying he seems strong.
The scene then changes to Hyouzou, the merman in question. As he carries the unconscious bodies of Hammond and Kasagon back to the Fish-Man District, he hears a scream coming from the cove. He just thinks it is noisy Mermaids having fun. He then starts berating himself for accidentally poisoning Luffy, as he'd be in trouble if he dies. In the cove, a mermaid says that the scream came from Ishilly's group. Another Mermaid said she had heard it from where she was, and that Ishilly had mentioned something about opening the barrel they found. The barrel is now broken open and a muddy substance slithers away from the scene.
The scene changes to the back of the Mermaid Cafe. Camie is talking to her boss, Madame Shyarly, who was asking about Sanji's well being. Camie thanks her for letting them borrow a room, and then asks Madame Shyarly not to go in to see Sanji as she is beautiful, therefore dangerous to Sanji. She also asks her to keep it a secret from Sanji that he is in the back of the Mermaid Cafe. Camie tells her that Chopper told her they would be in big trouble if Sanji found out where he was. Madame Shyarly comments on the irregularity of Chopper and Camie's requests. Luffy and Usopp find Shyarly's crystal ball, which she tells them not to touch. Camie explains to them that Shyarly is a fortune teller, and was rather well known. Shyarly however, said that she was retired, as the future was better left unknown. Luffy then asks her ""So, do mermaids poop?"", and Usopp asks why he used ""so"" in his question. This angered Shyarly who called Luffy a vulgar child. Camie quickly told him to apologize, which he did. Shyarly then tells Camie to take the rest of the day off and show her friends the island. She said not to worry about the influx of human pirate customers, as she had enough hired help to start handling the crowd. The ""star"" part of the word ""start"" made Camie remember Pappag, and how she had to deliver a clam to him. Shyarly tells her that Pappag is in the cafe, making a ruckus about some old friend of his.
After leaving the room, Camie tells the Straw Hats about some of Madame Shyarly's famous predictions, such as predicting the Great Age of Pirates one year ahead of time. She also accurately predicted the war at Marineford and Whitebeard's death. Because of her accuracy at predicting disasters, she has come to hate her ability to see the future. She takes them to the main street of Coral Hill and the front entrance of the Mermaid Cafe. When Luffy stated how hungry he was, Camie said they have cakes, sea fruits, and shellfish, but no meat in the sense Luffy was thinking. Usopp tries to distract Luffy from his bitterness about the lack of meat by reminding him Pappag is inside.
That friend that Pappag was talking about turned out to be Brook. Pappag was glad to see Luffy and Usopp. Brook has a mermaid on either side of him. One of them kisses him on the cheek, telling him to come back soon, saying the whole time he was there was like a dream come true. After telling them he will be back, brook launches into a slew of his bone jokes, bodily jokes, and already dead jokes. Usopp was surprised by Brook's excitement. Pappag interrupts, saying he was about to show Brook his estate. Pappag entices Luffy with sea monster meat, saying it is a staple of his diet and he always has a lot in his house. Camie gives him the Orient clam, which delights the starfish. Usopp was confused since it was a shellfish. Camie explained that fish-men can eat meat and fish while mermaids cannot. Luffy is relieved to hear there is meat on the island after all. As they call a taxi, Brook notices a wanted poster of Vander Decken. Pappag was surprised that the crew had met him, telling them he is like a bandit of the sea floor and the whole country has been searching for him for years. He then tells them to get on the taxi.
Pappag explained that it started with Vander Decken sending a letter once a week to the Mermaid Princess. The letters eventually became packages which eventually became threatening marriage proposals. The princess became too scared to ignore him any longer. Camie chimes in, adding that her father, King Neptune, became angry and had his three sons form an army. They have been searching for him without any success. Pappag tries to interrupt her, saying he had just been explaining that. Camie summarizes it by saying that the Mermaid Princess is the younger sister to the three princes, and King Neptune is the father of all four of them. Brook then says he wants to hear about how Vander Decken, a pirate who was cursed hundreds of years ago, plays into it. Pappag explained that legends tend to get exaggerated, but that the ""mad captain"" known as Vander Decken really did exist. The legend had it that he came to Fish-Man Island and died. The ship they saw was the real Flying Dutchman, but the captain was his grandson (Camie interrupts here again to finish the story, leaving Pappag in despair), Vander Decken IX. Brook makes another joke about how seeing Vander Decken nearly scared the life right out of him.
Luffy then redirects the conversation by pointing out how a mermaid has split fins similar to Kokoro's. He asks Camie if that is how her fins will look like when she reaches age 30, to which she replies with a yes. Luffy then sees a fish-man dad with an older fish-man child and a merman baby. Luffy remarks how fun the variety in sizes and colors of each species is. Pappag explains that when a Fish-Man and Mermaid marry, they could either have a baby that is Merman/maid or Fish-Man/woman, so there are four types of patterns. As they are about to get on a highway, Luffy asks about something in the distance. Pappag replies that it is the Candy Factory. Luffy asks why there is a pirate flag on it. Pappag tells him that there's a similar one at the entrance to the port, as the island is now under the protection of Charlotte Linlin, also known as Big Mom, the Four Emperors. Pappag explains that after the war, Big Mom started protecting the island since Whitebeard had died. In return for her protection, she demands a large amount of candy every month. Camie explains that the island is so dangerous that they need something big protecting it, otherwise, the government could not function. Luffy thinks Big Mom must be nice if she decided to protect Fish-Man Island. Pappag said that Whitebeard did not require collateral, and that Big Mom might be looking at it from a business perspective.
Luffy says that she's one of the Four Emperors, like Shanks, and wonders if he will ever meet her some day. Their taxi then arrives in Gyoverly Hills, where everyone is amazed by the size of Pappag's house. Back in Coral Hill, Madame Shyarly is making a scene outside, saying something is going to be catastrophic. Everyone is asking her what is wrong. She tells them to go and find the pirate wearing a straw hat and send him out of the country at once. A man asks what is going on and if she saw something in her crystal ball. Shyarly explains that she did not mean to see it, but she felt something from Luffy which prompted her to look into the future. Hiding her head in her hands, she says that she hopes she is wrong. The fortune foretold that Fish-Man Island would be destroyed by Luffy's hand.","Tony Tony Chopper, Camie, Sanji, Usopp, Monkey D.

Hody destroys Gyro's ship with handcuffs on to show how powerful he is. He defeated them all but left them still conscious so that they can tell about what is happening under sea to the people on earth.","In the open sea, Gyro remembers the time when he was attacked by the New Fish-Man Pirates and vowing never to return to the Fish-Man Island. On the Noah, Hody Jones turns down the offer from his subordinate Ikaros Much to defeat them and says that he will do it himself.

While on their way to Ryugu Palace, Nami explains how she, Franky, and Nico Robin parted company. Upon reaching the palace, Luffy wanders off in search of food and encounters the giant Mermaid Princess, Shirahoshi.","The episode starts out with a flashback, showing how Ishilly and her friends were captured by Caribou. The flashback ends with Caribou saying how he should thank the Straw Hats for taking him to ""Treasure Island"". Back in the present, Fukaboshi and his brothers, along with their guards, are talking to Madam Shyarly about her prediction. Fukaboshi, after discussing the matter with some of the Fish-Man islanders, decides to find and take the Straw Hats into custody. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats, and their friends, discuss amongst themselves and King Neptune.
Eventually, Neptune tells them that their swordsman, Zoro (the king mispronounces his name though, causing Usopp and Nami to correct him and nearly fall of Megalo), has arrived at the Ryugu Palace before them and that he had rudely requested to have some sake to drink while awaiting his crew. Luffy, after Nami and Usopp nearly fell off Megalo, asks Nami where Franky and Robin are. Nami replies that Franky is looking for the relatives of his old shipwright master Tom, he wants to tell the family how much Tom meant to him. Robin replied that she is going to find some information on history of Fish-Man Island, and possibly, something related to the Poneglyphs. After the flashback ends, The group enters the palace and are taken back by its beauty. Upon entering the inside, everyone (mostly the King) are welcomed by an array of guards. The king then tells the Straw Hats to enjoy themselves, however, a voice scolds Neptune for going out without an escort. Everyone is in shock as they watch the king get scolded. Neptune tells the voice, which turns out to be one of Neptunes ministers, that he brought the Straw Hats for the banquet and asks if his daughter, Princess Shirahoshi, is okay.
The two ministers then tell him that ""it"" happened again, Neptune raises his voice, telling them how important it is to keep the Princess calm, which leads to Neptune getting scolded again. The Minister of the Left then tells the king that a message from his son, Fukaboshi came in, the minister then remarks on how important it is. During this whole commotion, Luffy sneaks away, following the smell of food in the distance. He eventually comes to a large door, which a guard is placing two big carts full of food in. Luffy sneaks past the guard, which is easy to do since the guard much larger than him, and opens the large door into the room. Luffy tries to use his nose to guide him in the dark room to find the food, but as he's making his way towards the food, he ends up on what he thinks to be coral. He remarks on how practically everything on Fish-Man Island is made of coral and precedes to bouncy on the ""coral' remarking how it feels like pudding.
A voice calls out and a light is turned on, Luffy, after falling off the ""coral"" then see's the Mermaid Princess, who is vastly larger than him, and it turns out that the ""soft coral"" Luffy was curiously playing on and touching up were actually her large breasts.

She makes a futile attempt to scare Luffy by telling him who she's related to, but she eventually starts to cry.

Hody tells Hachi there is no stopping their objective and they need Fish-Man Island to destroy the human race and carry out Arlong's will. Hachi states that Arlong lost and demands to know why Hyouzou and Decken are working for him despite not working for Arlong in the past.

Luffy asks Shirahoshi why she got out of Megalo's mouth, she apologizes and asks him not to get mad at her as she starts to cry. As someone calls Luffy filthy and heartless, Chopper urges Sanji not to turn around. Sanji realizes that Chopper's warning can only mean that the Mermaid Princess is right behind him. Chopper tells him he is correct, but seeing the princess would without a doubt kill him if a normal mermaid made him lose so much blood before.
As Sanji begins to get lost in thought, he remembers hearing that even the most beautiful woman in the world, the pirate empress, would pale in comparison, and realizes that his dream is now in his grasp. He then tells Chopper that for the sake of his dreams, he chooses death – Chopper retorts by exclaiming that he thought that his dream was to find the All Blue. He turns around and looks at her. He realizes that he is gazing upon something that his imagination could never fathom, that no painting could ever capture. He then turns to stone, much to Chopper's shock.
Luffy is examining Hatchan, trying to get Hachi to tell him who attacked him. Chopper wonders if Sanji turning to stone could be from a side effect of receiving okama blood. Shirahoshi cries and asks Luffy what she should do, but all of a sudden, the locals take action and tie up Luffy, Chopper, Hatchan, and the still petrified Sanji. Luffy asks them what they are doing, and the locals tell him not to underestimate the warriors of Fish-Man Island. One of the locals identifies Hatchan as a former member of Arlong's gang.

Someone then notices that Luffy is not lying, and everyone is shocked to see it is none other than Vander Decken IX. Decken yells that he found her, this time saying ""Of course I did"" instead of ""I think"". The locals are shocked that after hiding out for ten years, he now suddenly appeared on the island, and someone yells for Shirahoshi to run for it. Decken tells Shirahoshi to give him an answer, saying she will escape death if she says yes, telling her to run away with him and marry him. The locals are shocked to hear him ask for marriage after constantly attempting to take her life. Shirahoshi tells him she is sorry, but he is not her type.
The locals are comically stunned to find out that is why she will not marry him, and not his violent tendencies. Decken is crushed, and actually looks emotionally hurt. He tells her she should be ashamed of herself, because he has had feelings for her for the past ten years and then she steps all over them. He then asks her who she is planning to be with. He goes on to say that now that he knows her feelings toward him, her existence is now an eyesore. He gets ready to attack her as a local tells her to run, but Luffy tells her to wait, having now dubbed her 'scaredy cat'.
A local grabs him by the collar, and asks him if he is working for Decken, and if he wants the princess to die. Luffy shouts that if she gets too far away from him, then he cannot protect her, so Shirahoshi tells Luffy she will remain with him. Decken then attacks Shirahoshi with another axe with a rose painted on it. Luffy tries to help, but is blocked by locals who still think he is trying to harm the princess. Luffy apologizes, saying he has nothing against them, then knocks them out with a burst of Haoshoku Haki because they are in his way. He then kicks off from the ground, flying toward Decken who is still on the coral. He does a flip in the air and brings his legs down on the coral, sending it crashing to the ground and knocking Decken off. The locals are amazed at Luffy's abilities, even when he is tied up.
Decken asks Luffy why he is interfering with his and Shirahoshi's love, and figures that Luffy was the one who brought Shirahoshi out of the palace. And Luffy realizes that Decken was the one who had been throwing things at Shirahoshi as he gets ready to do an attack. Decken tells him he will take both of their lives, saying they would not be a pair, as they would be cut into a set of four. Luffy then uses a new technique, Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer, plowing Vander Decken IX into the ground head first. The locals are shocked to see that Luffy beat Vander Decken.
They then realize that Decken was still moving, despite being planted head first into the ground, and decide to capture him. Luffy headbutts Megalo, telling him to wake up and asks Sanji if he is alright. Chopper tells Luffy that Sanji had turned to stone earlier, but now he seems happy, and most importantly, conscious. Luffy tells Shirahoshi they need to go. Shirahoshi asks Luffy not to yell at her, as all the excitement has gotten her quite worked up. Luffy tells her that for some reason the island hates them, and they need to get out of here.
Shirahoshi unties Luffy, making the locals wonder why she is helping him. She apologizes to them, and tells them she will be home in time for dinner, which confuses them. The Straw Hats get on Megalo's back, and Shirahoshi grabs on to his jaws (much to his discomfort), as they get away. Just as they get away, Vander Decken IX gets his head out of the ground and swats away the people trying to capture him. Yelling that they will not get away, he calls on Wadatsumi and tells him to pound them into the ground. Wadatsumi gets ready to punch them, but Luffy beats him to it, and hits him in the face with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol, breaking one of his teeth. Decken seems upset that they got away.
The scene changes to the Ryugu Palace, where someone informs Jones that Nami and Camie had escaped. Jones tells him to ignore it. Nami and Camie are then seen escaping, with the former holding onto the latter's back with an air bubble around her head. Camie asks if it was ok for them to leave the others behind but Nami tells her to relax, as nothing good could come by worrying. Camie tells her she knows that they are all strong, but that Hatchan told her that Jones's mind is more dangerous than his strength. Nami then asks her what kind of person Jinbe is. Camie replies that he is a pirate who is popular at the Ryugu Palace and can come and go as he pleases. Nami remembers that he was also in the same crew as Arlong, and that Jones is the successor to Arlong's will.
She then mentions one of Jinbe's messages to Luffy, ""Don't fight Hody"". Nami adds that she thinks she has figured out what the message means. Camie tells her she thought it only meant that Jones is dangerous. Nami adds that it is okay for Zoro and the others to get Jones angry. She then tells Camie she wants to meet Jinbe, and remembers he is waiting at the Sea Forest. Nami says that the situation seems to have a long and deep-rooted history, and has a feeling that Jinbe knows all about it. She then asks Camie to head to the sea forest.
Back in the palace, Neptune is giving orders to his guards. The soldiers tell him they will take care of Jones and the pirates. Neptune tells them not to. He tells them that even though he did not get a chance to fight, they all ended up as victims. He orders them to surrender the castle for now, reunite with Fukaboshi, and get ready for the rematch.
The guards are shocked at the orders. Usopp and Brook are in the water. Usopp wonders what Zoro can do to fight a fish-man in the water as Brook tells Usopp he is not going to make it. The episode ends with Zoro seemingly defeating Jones with a single slash, and the New Fish-Man Pirates astounded at what happened to their captain, with Usopp looking on in shock.","Vander Decken IX, Shirahoshi, Megalo, Monkey D.

Nami then has flashbacks of her past and how Arlong messed up her life. Afterwards, Hatchi explained to Nami how when they were just children they dreamed of the land where humans lived, but was in return rejected. Jinbe talks about how the relationship between fish-men and humans stayed the same, even over 200 years, and the two people that rose to power to change history were Queen Otohime and Fisher Tiger. But for the two of them, what was their hidden angst?","Robin is seen walking through the Sea Forest and eventually finds what she was looking for. Meanwhile, Neptune's army escapes the palace and the Ministers lament on how this has turned out. The Minister of the Right tells the soldiers to look for the princes and then they'll come back to reclaim the palace. While this is going on, the New Fish-Man Pirates are forcing the citizens of Fish-Man Island to step on a Fumi-e of Otohime's face as loyalty. As Dosun is forcing the citizens to do this, Fukaboshi arrives and punches him in the face in anger for forcing the citizens to step the on the Fumi-e of his late mother's face.
At the graveyard, Jinbe reassures Shirahoshi that her father will be saved. Sanji is serving tea to the girls and Nami tells him to settle down as she's trying to have a conversation with Jinbe and wants to know if he really did send Arlong to the East Blue. Sanji also wants to know as he remembers Jinbe's name from what Yosaku mentioned two years ago and from reading the paper involving Luffy working together with Jinbe. He goes on to state how hard Nami has had it with Arlong for eight long years and claims what he says next will decide if he forgives him or not. Jinbe is left shocked by hearing this and Hachi states it's all true, while Nami reminisces her time with Arlong's gang. Nami states that no matter what, she will never forgive Arlong for what he did and notes that from two years ago on Sabaody, she never imagined that Fish-Men would ever be captured and noticed that Sabaody Park is identical to Arlong Park in design. Hachi states that Arlong always hated humans, but as a child, along with Hachi and the others, desired to be a part of the Human world. He states that 200 years ago was when the World Government made a truce with Fish-Men and the king was later able to attend the council of kings. However, mankind still hated fish-men.
Den talks about how the Great Pirate Era caused great trouble on the island and Jinbe states how that was ended thanks to the late Whitebeard. Jinbe talks about how those in the government with power are the ones who are the worst in discrimination, such as the World Nobles. He states that two people on the island attempted to make a change for Fish-Men: the hero of slaves, Fisher Tiger, and the late queen, Otohime. While Luffy cannot remember Tiger completely from his talk with Hancock, Jinbe states it was because of these two that changed the history of the island.","Nico Robin, Minister of the Left, Minister of the Right, Ikaros Much, Daruma, Hyouzou, Zeo, Dosun, Fukaboshi, Otohime (photo), Monkey D.

The story now goes back 16 years ago, on Fish-Man Island, a robber has taken some money with a hostage, then the Queen rushes over to help despite her guards saying they'll handle it.
The robber warns her and shoots, but Otohime dodges with the usage of Kenbunshoku Haki and slaps the robber. She screams in pain from the slap due to her fragile body. She asks the robber why he did what he did, and he states that he has 10 children that need feeding and his job burnt down and needs the money, while Otohime just slaps him to knock some sense into him. She then cries apologizing for not knowing the pain he was going through and he starts crying to for what he did, but was desperate to help his wife and children.
The guards arrest him and he swears he will become a changed man and Otohime supports him. The citizens all commend Otohime and how she always tries to help others. Otohime now gives a speech about humans and how they shouldn't judge them and try to befriend them above the surface and encourages the citizens to sign a petition for a migration for the World Council coming up. The citizens refuse because of their dislike towards humans, while Jinbe just comments that this will never change anything.
At the palace, Otohime returns to her children and comforts a crying baby Shirahoshi while the brothers promised they looked after her. Neptune is seen talking with the ministers about Otohime's dream while telling them about how their ancestors tried to take the Fish-Men to the surface hundreds of years ago using the Noah, but ended in failure. He tells them to look over Otohime. The next day, at a bar, some pirates are harassing a Fish-Man waitress stating that they think Fish-Men are just so special and Jinbe steps in and tells them to shut up as they are making his sake taste bad.

Arlong does and states it's been a long time ""Brother"". Jinbe just calls him trash and scum stating he does not want anything to do with Arlong. Fisher Tiger arrives and the citizens greet him along with Arlong and Jinbe with Tiger greeting the two. Jinbe states he was on a long trip this time and Tiger states he has some business to attend to at the palace. When he arrives, he tells the King that he's going to free the slaves and when Neptune asks what he saw, he just says ""humans"", and seemingly explains what he saw, causing Otohime to break into tears. Sometime later, news of Tiger's raid on Mary Geoise made it's way to all of Fish-Man Island and as a result, the whole island is in an uproar celebrating Tiger's heroism. As a result, Jinbe leaves the army, Arlong's gang and Macro's join the Sun Pirates with the slaves.","Megalo, Shirahoshi, Jinbe, Sanji, Nami, Monkey D.

Elsewhere, the remaining citizens of Fish-Man Island celebrate the heroic efforts of Tiger, calling him a ""hero"", whilst Queen Otohime tries to gather signatures for people to migrate to the human world, but only gets ignored due to the news of Tiger. Hody Jones is seen briefly during his youth, wishing he could have seen it for himself.
The Sun Pirates are attacked by a Marine battleship led by Kadar who demands the fish-men return all the slaves Tiger had freed, only to be brutally assaulted by the angry fish-men, who reprimand the Marines for worrying more about reclaiming Celestial Dragon slaves rather than stopping slavery. The fish-men take all their belongings and Arlong secretly kills one of the Marines.
Vice Admiral Kizaru receives reports of the dangerous Sun Pirates and later issues the two most dangerous members, Jinbe and Tiger bounties. Back on the ship, Tiger scolds Arlong for killing the Marine and makes a speech about liberation and freedom over revenge, but later tells Jinbe that ""demons"" he has inside of him wishes he could kill humans.
The Sun Pirates then get asked to escort a scruffy human slave, Koala to her hometown, which Tiger grudgingly accepts. During their time with Koala, Arlong beats her for being a human and the crew are shocked at her demeanor and fear of them, taking pity on her. Tiger finally removes her slave mark and replaces it with a sun. Koala then finally shows emotion by crying.","The story now goes 15 years into the past, as Neptune, holding a baby Shirahoshi, comments on how Tiger's actions will stop Fish-Man Island from attending the World Summit for a while. Otohime comments that they could never have stopped him after hearing the voice in his heart. Tiger's attack on Mary Geoise is spread throughout the whole island and everyone celebrates his attack and freeing the slaves, calling him the hero of Fish-Man Island. Otohime tries to get others to sign her petition for migrating to the human world, only to be turned down by the people due to them celebrating Fisher Tiger and his attack and they all leave. At the Fish-Man District a young Hody Jones and New Fish-Man Pirates all comment on Tiger's attack, wishing to have joined them. They cheer them on believing that their goal is killing humans.
At the Sun Pirates, Hachi tells the boss that there is a Marine ship coming and the crew prepare for battle. Arlong leads the attack and the Marines are having a hard time attacking them due to them being underwater. Rear Admiral Kadar demands that they return the slaves and the Marines are being attacked under the ship. A Marine states to Jinbe that it's a crime for freeing slaves and that the Fish-Men should never go against humans. Jinbe, enraged, brutally assaults the human and asks why freeing slaves is a crime while slavery is not a crime and asks Otohime if this is the peace they can have with humans. Tiger begins his attack on the Marines and Kadar demands that he gives back the slaves only for Tiger to defeat him with a kick and ask what slaves are on the ship, stating that if they have a slave mark, then they should be found but due to the sun mark they cannot tell which is which. Tiger declares he will not have them killed, but will take their belongings and Arlong tries to kill a human for stating that being a human is sinful and Tiger tries to stop him but is too late.
At Marineford, Vice Admiral Borsalino is hearing a report from Rear Admiral Strawberry, about the crew and how powerful they are, for defeating Kadar and how dangerous they are in the water. Back at the Sun Pirates, Tiger is scolding Arlong for killing that Marine despite his protests. Jinbe states that they are out to kill the crew and they have to step up to be ready for them. Tiger states that killing them will make them as bad as the humans, stating this is not for revenge and neither what he did at Mary Geoise. He states that the Sun Pirates are about freedom and liberation and that they will never kill anyone. Arlong protests stating they should kill humans to make an example out of them and scare them only for Jinbe to punch him in the head for disobedience. At night, Tiger has a private talk with Jinbe and tells him that the ""demons"" that dwell within his heart are the most terrifying. Over time, as Otohime continues to try gaining supporters for her petition, Tiger and Jinbe gain bounties of 230 million and 76 million, respectively.
Three years later, on an island, Tiger would be asked by the people to take a former slave named Koala home and agreed while Koala would thank Tiger for what he did. Arlong is disgusted for having a human on board and assaults her for constantly smiling while Hachi holds him back. She gets up and rips some of her pants and starts cleaning the deck while blood is coming out of her nose, confusing the crew and even Arlong. Jinbe asks what she's doing and she just continually apologizes and states she will not stop working and will not cry so she will not be killed. Jinbe is shocked and takes pity on how traumatized she is and realizes how afraid she is of them because she wants to go home. Aladine states that she's acting like this because she may have seen other slaves been killed for taking breaks or not smiling and thinks she cannot trust anyone. Tiger decides to take her to his room and marks her with the sun symbol stating while it's harsh, she cannot forget the fact she was once a slave but can hide the mark. She later wakes up and apologizes for passing out, but did not cry, causing Tiger to yell stating it's alright to cry, stating they are not like the stupid World Nobles. He takes a gun and throws it overboard to prove a point and states that they will not kill anyone and tells his crew that they'll take her home no matter what, causing Koala to finally cry.","Hatchan, Tony Tony Chopper, Camie, Monkey D.

When they reach her hometown, Tiger takes Koala to her home, where she is emotionally reunited with her mother while Tiger leaves, but not before Koala says goodbye to him, which he smiles at.
On his way back to the ship, he is ambushed by a fleet of Marines who were told their location by the townspeople and start to attack him. Meanwhile, Jinbe and Arlong hear the fighting and decide to go help, but are inevitably too late, as Tiger has sustained severe injuries from his encounter.
On a battleship Arlong earlier hijacked, the crew try to save his life with a blood transfusion (human blood) but Tiger refuses, stating he would rather die than receive anything belonging to humans, telling his crew about his harsh past then dying shortly thereafter, while the Sun Pirates grieve over his loss.","The Sun Pirates get the Eternal Pose to Koala's hometown.

Just as Fisher Tiger leaves, he gets attacked by Marines with Rear Admiral Strawberry stating that someone from the village has informed him about his arrival, but the people on the island were alright with the Marines attacking him in exchange that Koala will not return to the Celestial Dragons as property. He tells Tiger that his crimes are assault and evasion. Jinbe hears gunshots and sees Marine battleships arrive and start attacking the ship while Arlong comments on how this is what humans are. Meanwhile, Jinbe says to Arlong that they need to go and find Fisher Tiger to bring him back safely. Arlong hijacks one of the Marines ships and Jinbe and the others manage to save Tiger. Tiger however, has sustained several injuries with blood all over him from the bullet wounds while Koala is unaware of what happened and her mother not telling her what happened.
On the ship they hijacked, Aladine tries to perform a blood transfusion to save Tiger because human blood is the same as fish-man's, but Fisher Tiger refuses to transfuse human blood into his body, stating it has the blood of humans who hate fish-men and that their blood is tainted and he will not give in to humans. Tiger explains to his crew that he was a slave and how he escaped and why he saved all the slaves. He says that both humans as well as fish-men need peace and admits that Otohime was right and that only the children of the next generation like Koala who aren't prejudiced, and asks his crew not to tell the island of what really happened nor of their grudge and hatred towards the humans for the sake of the future. He states that his body would reject that blood due to the demon that dwells inside his heart and he's tried but he just cannot ever love a human. Jinbe and Aladine beg Tiger to live and reassure him of how he's the hero of slaves and the greatest fish-man ever, giving Tiger comfort as he remembers his youth and the episode ends with Fisher Tiger's death and his crew grieving the loss of their beloved captain.","Koala, Hatchan, Fisher Tiger, Arlong, Aladine, Jinbe, Otohime (flashback), Gyaro, Macro, Tansui, Kuroobi, Chew, Megalo, Sanji, Nami, Shirahoshi (not fully seen), Monkey D.

Jinbe sends a letter to Neptune and Otohime to tell them about Tiger's death and Otohime continues to try to gather signatures for her petition, but after a short time, many of the citizens and their children take back their previous signatures which leads to her going back to the palace, only to stay in a drunken depression whilst ranting about her ambitions, broadcasting it to the entire country which changes the views of some citizens.
Jinbe receives an invitation to the Shichibukai and accepts to further bolster the relations between humans and fish-men species (for Otohime) and to watch the World Government and demands that Arlong be released.
Upon his return, Arlong states he's leaving the Sun Pirates to make his own Arlong Pirates who will wreak havoc upon the East Blue and challenges Jinbe to stop him, Jinbe loses his temper with him and beats him to a bloody pulp, but leaves him alive and demands his crew removes him before he changes his mind.
The crew then splits into three, with the Arlong Pirates and Macro Pirates splitting away from the original crew as the episode ends.","Arlong is enraged over Tiger's death and, rather than choosing to obey Tiger's last wish, he does the exact opposite of what Tiger wanted: as he returns to Koala's home island, he plans to get revenge on the humans that sold him out. However, Vice-admiral Borsalino is there and easily defeats Arlong. Arlong states he's here to kill all the humans that sold Tiger out and how Tiger is now dead while Borsalino just states now he's gonna take him with him. At the G-2 Base, Arlong is being interrogated and yells how if not for human's blood being the cause of Tiger's death he would still be alive and states that humans killed Fisher Tiger. The next day Jinbe is reading the newspaper and notes how Arlong left out several details and lied to the Marines. Aladine states he did so that Tiger's reputation and pride would stay safe.

At Marineford, Strawberry tells Borsalino about how dangerous Jinbe is.
At the palace, Neptune and Otohime are reading a letter from Jinbe about the truth of Tiger and how they support Otohime's cause. Otohime gains more confidence and strives to gain more peace with humans and merfolk. She continues to gain more signatures, but the citizens are even more distrusting towards humans due to the news about Tiger and how they just cannot trust humans because of this. After the day, Shirahoshi at age 4 and the princes comfort her from her long day. Jinbe goes on to state how she continued to save humans and teach children about the outside world and continuing to gain more signatures. One day, a citizen asks how many signatures Otohime has. Otohime states there are 5 million people on the island and she only has 1,000 signatures, but still has a long way to go. The citizen and others ask for their signatures back, and so do some of the children having been told so by their parents. They state that they listen to her because she's queen, but it's the humans and cannot live with them and are tired of her speeches. They take all the signatures and the Minister of the Right can only take pity on the queen. At the palace, Otohime returns and is crying to herself with Neptune listening in depression. The next day, Otohime, drunk, makes a broadcast announcement for the whole island about how they choose to live on the bottom of the surface because of how there's a little light and air to live off of. She goes on to state how the children sneak off to view the outside world and how the people of the island are afraid of change for the world and if they can change that, then maybe they can see all the true wonders of the world. This seems to have an effect on the people.
One day, Jinbe receives a message from the World Government about becoming a Shichibukai. Macro states that because his bounty is now at 250 million and they are afraid of him. Jinbe actually decides to take them up on this offer.

Just then, they all point their guns at Mjosgard. The citizens tell them not to as they'll get into trouble if they kill him. One pirate member says that an Admiral can be summoned if a World Noble will be in danger, however, should there be no one to report the attack and just leave it off as a shipwreck incident because of the ocean floor, leaving Mjosgard horrified. The citizens realize he's right and support them stating the Noble should die for what he did to them. Mjosgard says that because he's a Noble he should be saved and tells them not to. The pirate says that he's tried but he cannot ever forgive him for what he did to them and just as he pulls the trigger, Otohime arrives and saves Mjosgard. She was only scratched and says to put their guns away as the children are watching.

Jinbe remembers what Tiger said about hatred and realizes Otohime's right. Just then, Mjosgard gets up and holds Otohime hostage stating that whether she's a queen of a kingdom or a ""fish"" kingdom, she's still lower in status than him and demands to be given a doctor and a mask. Just as he's about to kill her, Shirahoshi screams out for her mother and five Sea Kings pop up and horrify the citizens, Jinbe, Decken, Mjosgard and even Hody and the soldiers. Otohime is shocked by what Shirahoshi did while Jinbe wonders what happened and Hody gives a shocked look at Shirahoshi.

Decken shouts out to his ancestors that he finally found her and tells his crew that if he wants her power, he needs to marry her first, however, his crew reminds him that she's just a little girl prompting him to realize thats a problem. Aladine, seeing Mjosgard decides to treat him and then Otohime.
A few weeks pass and Mjosgard recovered, though he was entirely ungrateful, calling them cattle and saying they would regret it, while the soldiers comment on how ungrateful he is that they saved his life and shouldn't let him go as the island was in trouble if they let him go. Otohime wishes to go with him to the world above to prove that it's safe to travel up to the surface. Though reluctant, the citizens and family allow it and wish her the best of luck and return home safely.","Jinbe, Aladine, Shirahoshi, Megalo, Neptune, Otohime, Monkey D.

The Fish-Man pirates were left in shock over the strength of the attack, while the officers were in awe and talked with Hody over his transformation, asking him if he's alright, in which he replied ""never felt better"".
Suddenly, the three princes came crashing through the gate on their mount much to the joy of the citizens, but expresses their dismay when they see the state of Neptune's army. They turned their anger towards Hody and his crew. Neptune warns his sons to be careful of the beasts and the officers as they all have taken Energy Steroids. As the sea-beasts surround the princes, Fukaboshi yells at Hody Jones that he and his folk are the weakest on the island. He describes how the people of the island try to ignore their history of discrimination by humans, as well as endure the pain of losing Fisher Tiger and Queen Otohime to humans. That's why they signed their names for a better future and that Hody will never understand their kindness.
Hody, however scoffs at him, saying it's meaningless gesture and that its just human tricks. As the sea-beasts prepare to attack, the princes struck first taking out two sea-beasts each with their mount pitched in at defeating the sea-bear. The citizens were left in awe at the princes defeating the drug enhanced sea-beasts so easily. The princes then prepare to face Hody, reinforcing their will to prevent Hody from taking over the island and destroying the chance of peace their mother tried to achieve. Hody showed no relent and comments that the island will be ruled by the victors of this battle. As his officers each take a pill of Energy Steroids, the princes prepare to defend themselves from their unnatural strength.
The officers attacked quickly and without mercy dealing heavy injuries to the princes as well as their mount.

Episode 553,Shirahoshi's Tears! Luffy Finally Appears,24-Jun-12,"Shirahoshi reveals that Megalo witnessed Hody shooting Queen Otohime and told her in secret. Shirahoshi recounts her promise to her mother about not to bear any grudge towards her killer and has kept the secret with her ever since. Jinbe is shocked at how she kept the secret for so long. Hody, however, laughs at her; calling her actions stupid and taunting her, and saying that her secret would have stopped his plans for taking over the island. He proceeds to fire multiple Yabusame's on her family. Hody decides to execute King Neptune ahead of schedule. The citizens, remembering Shyarly's prediction begin chanting for Luffy to come and wreak havoc before Hody kills their beloved king.
Before Hody delivered the killing blow, Luffy escapes from Megalo's mouth and gives a Gear 2 powered kick at Hody, sending him flying through the plaza walls. Nami and Robin proceeds to free the royal family and Jinbe as well as steal back the World Nobles' letter. The rest of the crew arrive with the Thousand Sunny. The citizens ask Luffy if he is friend or foe, but Luffy replied they should judge it on their own.","Hody Jones asks Shirahoshi about the meaning behind her statement. Shirahoshi explains, saying that Megalo told her as Megalo witnessed everything that happened on that fateful day since he was part of Neptune's army. Jinbe comments that he is in disbelief and asks Shirahoshi why she kept it a secret but Shirahoshi interrupts before Jinbe could complete his question. Holding back tears, Shirahoshi says that it is not what her mother, Otohime would have wanted as citizens would hold a grudge against Hody afterwards. Shirahoshi recalls her last promise to her mother. The three princes question if Shirahoshi has been carrying this heavy burden on her shoulders while being all alone in the Hard Shell Tower.
Jinbe stares in disbelief and thinks to himself that it is incredible for Shirahoshi to accomplish such a feat as not many people would be able to do it. Hody laughs at this revelation, enraging Jinbe. Hody taunts Megalo, thanking him for telling this only to this stupid girl (Shirahoshi), which allows the New Fish-Man Pirates to be where they are today. Hody then reprimands Shirahoshi for her short-sighted actions, stating that such actions are called ""stupid"" in this world, that her choice will be the reason behind the fall of the Ryugu Kingdom and the cause of extermination of the country as well her and her family's deaths. Jinbe comforts Shirahoshi and says that her actions are correct. However, Hody objects and says it was foolish of Shirahoshi. To prove his point, Hody uses Yabusame on the captured royal family. After a series of attacks, Neptune falls and his crown rolls on the floor.
The citizens look on in shock while the outlaws celebrates and laugh at the sight. Hody prepares to behead the captured royal family ahead of the appointed time as his concerns, Jinbe and Shirahoshi, poses no threat now. The outlaws cheer and encourages Hody. Some children are clinging onto hope, demanding that Shyarly predicts when the pirate with a straw hat will arrive to destroy the island. Shyarly slumps her shoulders and answers that she cannot be certain and it could be days or even years from now. The child cries and says that he wants them to create havoc now as it would also be troublesome for the New Fish-Man Pirates and the other children agrees. Other adults are also hoping for the arrival of the Straw Hat Pirates. As others look on helplessly, one shouts for Luffy, asking him to do his worst right now. This starts off a plead and chant by the citizens.
Hody wants to prove them wrong by executing Neptune. As Hody swings his sword, Shirahoshi shouts for Luffy to save her father. Hody stops when he is inches away from Neptune's head and turns to watch Megalo, who struggles for a few moment before spitting something out. Without warning Luffy swiftly kicks Hody, sending him flying backwards. The citizens stare in shock and surprise at Luffy's arrival. Jinbe comments that it is too early for Luffy to appear but accepts that there was no choice. Jinbe then calls out, asking the others to hurry up. Ikaros Much wonders who is Jinbe speaking to. Nami replies to Jinbe, saying that they were prepared long ago as things regarding Luffy do not always proceed according to plan. Nami is in plain sight as she drops her mirage, shocking Ikaros.
Nami had stole the letter from the Celestial Dragons and further reveals she had handed the key unlocking the chains that bind the Princes and Neptune to Robin. The Thousand Sunny is flying towards the plaza with Franky onboard. Franky fires the Gaon Cannon at the plaza, paving the way for Hoe. Jinbe asks the princes to make off with Neptune. Dosun tries to intervene but fails. As the ship lands, it is revealed that Luffy's crew and Pappag are onboard as well.
As Luffy walk towards his crew, the citizens throw many questions at them, questioning their motive and actions. Luffy calmly answers that the citizen have to judge for themselves if the Straw Hat Pirates are friends or foes.","Neptune, Ryuboshi, Fukaboshi, Manboshi, Shirahoshi, Megalo, Hody Jones, Ikaros Much, Dosun, Hyouzou, Daruma, Zeo, Jinbe, Otohime (flashback), Shyarly, Monkey D.

Episode 554,"Big Clash! Straw Hat Pirates vs. 100,000 Opponents",1-Jul-12,"The citizens marvel and celebrate at the arrival of Luffy and his crew along with the enemy. The New Fish-Man Pirates wonder how some of the crew had survived and are alive and Jinbe comments on how his plan with the Straw Hat Pirates crew worked.
After a flashback of this plan and it being put in action along with a flashback of how Brook, Zoro, and Usopp had escaped from the palace, it seems that the rest of the New Fish-Man Pirates are not concerned with Hody Jones, their captain, being hit by Luffy. He seems to be not as harmed as he should have been as Hody berates Luffy and his crew along with himself, claming that he will become the King of the Pirates. This enrages Luffy as he takes down half of Hody's forces of 100,000 with Haki and says to Hody that he will become the King of the Pirates and not Hody himself.","Luffy asks Jinbe about his performance and Jinbe comments that it did not go exactly as planned and recalls the events that happened a few hours before at the Sea Forest.
For the sake of the citizens and their future, Jinbe wanted to portray Luffy as a hero while dealing with Hody Jones. However, Luffy rejected the idea, saying that he do not want to be a hero. Luffy asked if Jinbe knew what heroes are before defining heroes, saying that if there is a huge chunk of meat, pirates will simply have a banquet and consume it. However, heroes will share it among others and that is the reason Luffy do not want to become a hero as he wants all the meat for himself. Jinbe replied that he will get Luffy his meat if Luffy obeyed him, which Luffy readily agreed. Jinbe tells the crew about the plan he had in mind and it is revealed that Jinbe was caught voluntarily to provide a distraction, so as to let Nami steal the Celestial Dragon's letter and the key to the chains that is binding the royal family while Robin frees them. Jinbe will call out for help as a cue for Luffy to appear from Megalo's stomach because this will ensure that the citizens take notice of Jinbe and Luffy collaboration. The rest of the crew should head to Ryugu Kingdom to free their imprisoned comrades before assembling at the plaza. Shirahoshi is suppose to wait at a safe place outside the plaza and flee with her family afterwards. Jinbe asks about the reaction of the public and Hachi replies that almost every fish-man respects Jinbe and Camie says that if Jinbe trusts Luffy with his life while saving the Neptune, everyone will be on Luffy's side. Luffy is uncomfortable with the idea of people cheering him on and Nami agrees with him.
Pappag jumps into Luffy's arm at the plaza and complains that he has a few brushes with death due to Zoro and Usopp. The citizens are reacting as Jinbe has planned. Zeo tells Luffy not to push his luck as he is still a human pirate. Brook compliments Shirahoshi on her beauty and requests to see her panties, prompting Nami to smack him. Luffy comments that they are finally together again. Daruma tells Zeo that everyone is ignoring him but Zeo reasoned that it is because his voice was soft. Sanji claims credit for the rescue but Zoro says that they had gotten to the exit all on their own and Usopp agrees. Pappag says that they could not have done it without his help. Nami is surprised and Usopp explains that Brook became a ghost and Luffy is puzzled. Brook says that his new ability as helped them and recalls their escape. Brook chased Pappag for a long time before Pappag finally recognized him. Just as the water reaches the cage, Brook arrived with Pappag, who is carrying all of Zoro's sword. Zoro cut through the chains and cage while damaging the walls in the process. Water is receding from the gaps and into other rooms but Zoro continues, which made the water fill the room again as this time, it is the water from outside the palace. They swam out and the rescue crew made a timely appearance as they were running out of breathe.
Chopper wonders why the New Fish-Man Pirates are not worried despite their captain being beaten by Luffy and Robin agrees, commenting that it is odd. Nami hands Shirahoshi the letter and Shirahoshi thank her profusely as the letter is the hope that her mother, Otohime, had left behind. Luffy comments that it is not safe for Shirahoshi and calls her by a new nickname, Yowamushi. Jinbe agrees and says that this situation is not in the plan. Nami and Jinbe commend Shirahoshi for her actions and Shirahoshi apologies, saying that she has caused trouble. However, Jinbe brushes it off, telling her that it's fine and states that not passing hatred onto the next generation is what the brave heroes, Tiger and Otohime, was trying to teach them. Jinbe believes that if all citizens think the way Shirahoshi did, the conflict between Fish-Man and humans will be resolved.
Hody is standing and calls Vander Decken IX useless for failing to get rid of Shirahoshi. Zeo comments that the Energy Steroids are still working and Daruma says that it is to be expected as their captain has ingested a lot of them. Hody tells Jinbe that he should have noticed it when Jinbe allowed himself to be captured without resisting. Hody berates Jinbe, saying that, although Tiger and Arlong suffered at the hands of human, instead of seeking revenge for them, Jinbe works with them. Hody tells them that after he is king of the island, everything will change and he will capitalize on the opportunity during the World's Summit by killing all the human kings and begin a legend of the terrifying underwater kingdom. Hody shares his plans for capturing human as slaves and slowly taking over the world, even the world of pirates as Hody will become the king of pirates. Hody laughs at them, commenting on their size and saying that they will not be able to do anything as they are up against 100,000 enemies. The citizens worry for the Straw Hat Pirates as well as for their own future should Hody take over the island.
Hody gives the order to kill the Straw Hat Pirates. Chopper and Pappag panics and Robin comments that before they even fight, they might get squashed, frightening Usopp. Nami is gearing up to fight and encourages others. However, while saying this, Nami is hiding behind Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji. Sanji divides the numbers and says that each of them has to take 10,000 enemies. Zoro comments that even though they are outnumbered, the enemy is not necessarily stronger as it is not like they are up against elite Navy soldiers and tells Sanji not to shit himself. Sanji is irked and they begin arguing. Luffy pushes them apart and walks past them, towards the approaching enemies. Others are wondering at Luffy's action. Enemies are surrounding Luffy, preparing to kill him but Luffy unleashes a massive bout of Supreme King Haki, knocking out around 50,000 opponent and shocking the New Fish-Man Pirates, and stunning almost everyone, who are wondering how Luffy manage to do that since Luffy did not appear to have done anything. Robin identifies Luffy's action and Jinbe comments on Luffy's progress. Sanji is not surprised and Zoro even expected it, saying that if Luffy cannot do that, then he needs to step down. Luffy slowly steps towards Hody and declares that there can only be one King of the Pirates.","Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Zoro starts showing off his newly modified sword attacks while Sanji displays a more powerful style of kicking.","The remaining fish-man pirates are shocked at the ease at which Luffy brought down many of their numbers. They begin retreating but Zeo asks them where they are going, saying that if they run away, they deserve death. Zeo states that even though they have lost 50,000, they are still 50,000 strong. Zeo continues by saying that the Straw Hat Pirates are their worst enemy and Jinbe is a betrayer. The outlaws are encouraged by Zeo’s prep talk and regain their fighting spirit. Zoro tells Luffy that he wished Luffy had not reduced the numbers so drastically. Brook is all hyped up and wants to sing a song to start the battle but Robin bluntly states that they are not here to see him. The outlaw comments that the Straw Hat Pirates are not listening and Zeo's pride prevents him from acknowledging that and instead, he says that it is because they did not hear it. Hody Jones gives the command to kill them and the outlaws charge.
Luffy makes the first move with his Gear 3, Giant Pistol. Jinbe calmly says that they should join him and Zoro comments that Luffy did not wait for them again. Sanji says he has to do this for Shirahoshi's sake as men who cannot wipe tears away from woman's eyes are not real man and enters the fray, kicking the enemies down. Zoro uses 108 Pound Cannon, further reducing the numbers. A group of outlaws are standing in front of Robin and Robin says that there exist important resources that should not be destroyed on the island and uses Trienta Fleurs, Clutch on them. Another group approaches Brook and he begins dancing. Slowly, the group joins in, caught up in Brook's performance and Brook cuts them down in their moment of distraction.

Hody challenges them to try and save the giant mermaid in the middle of the plaza and launches Water Shot. Luffy watches worriedly but Hody's attack is deflected. It is Jinbe's doing and Daruma is surprised that Jinbe is capable of this and calls him a monster. The outlaws are hesitant to attack but Hody says that there is nowhere else for them to run to. Zoro comments that the battle is boring and Zeo asks him not to speak before he encounters the formidable defense of the New Fish-Man Pirates, the Iron Shell Squad. Zoro recalls the events that he experienced previously and resolves that he will never lose again. Zoro uses Great Dragon Twister. It slices through the iron shells effortlessly and one outlaw compares it to looking like the Grim Reaper's scythe. The outlaws runs away, begging Zoro not to follow them but Zoro replies that he will chase them to Hell's end.
Daruma reminds the outlaws to use their brains and the outlaws launch an attack from the sky, making use of their bubbles to float. The Sea Urchin Spike Unit surrounds Sanji but Sanji appears unconcerned. Sanji recalls the days on Momoiro Island and the unit attacks, hurting themselves in the process due to their spikes. However, Sanji is unharmed and he is flying through the usage of his Sky Walk. Luffy recognizes that technique and Robin identifies it as the CP9's Geppo.

Meanwhile, Vander Decken IX once again offers Shirahoshi his hand in marriage, and upon rejection, releases another barrage of attacks. These are all blocked by Manboshi, Ryuboshi, and Hoe. Hody's Energy Steroids are allowing him to catch up with Luffy and Fukaboshi. Luffy asks to go to the deck of Noah, as there will be air for him to fight there, but Hody gets there first and stabs Vander Decken in order to destroy the island.","Noah is going slightly away from the island, thanks to Shirahoshi's efforts. She realizes she has to get into the ocean or the bubble will burst. The main entrance is too far but she has an idea. As Hody Jones climbs the chain, the citizens try to think of something they can do for her. Meanwhile, Sanji is carefully calculating the force with which he must launch Luffy, and throws him with Armée de l'Air Rubber Shoot. He overshoots it slightly and Luffy goes out into the ocean but is close enough so he can grab onto the chain, remarking how huge it is. Luffy looks down and sees Hody below him. He then sees the citizens in the plaza grab the chain in an attempt to slow the enormous boat down. Shirahoshi is touched by their actions. However, Hody is annoyed at them, saying they will not slow it down at all, while Luffy vociferates loudly to stop. Hody attacks the citizens with Yabusame, and they all fall back to the plaza, much to Luffy's anger.
Shirahoshi sees the entrance to the palace and is relieved that it is still open. She goes up the connecting corridor and then breaks through it to go out into the ocean. As the ship rises, Luffy manages to put a protective bubble around himself at the last minute. Unfortunately he let go of the chain and drifted away from it slightly. Hody appears behind him, saying a human who cannot breath underwater can never rule the ocean and he attacks Luffy and pops his bubble stating how humans with Devil Fruit powers cannot do anything underwater and throws his trident to kill him only to be saved by Fukaboshi. Decken calls out to Shirahoshi. He asks if she will die from loss of blood or from getting hit by the ship first. He gives her one last chance. He will save her if she agrees to marry him as he throws knives at her. Shirahoshi apologizes and again tells him he is not her type, much to Decken's stunned surprise as the knives are deflected by something.
Ryuboshi, Manboshi, and Hoe are then seen standing in front of Shirahoshi. Her brothers say there is no way she will marry him and they will not let him hurt their only sister. Decken seems surprised that she called them brothers. Shirahoshi tells them about what happened in the plaza after they left. Ryuboshi then tells them what their father said about how the ship cannot be damaged and they have to land it on the ocean floor where it will not be scratched. Noah appears and crashes into the rocks behind them but they escape. Manboshi tells Shirahoshi to get to the trenches and not to swim too close to Noah. He then points upward, saying there is nothing to damage it at a higher level. Ryuboshi says they will take care of Decken.
Luffy is then seen riding on Fukaboshi's back. Luffy thanks him and asks if his wounds are ok. Hody is then seen removing a large scythe blade from a sheath, calling it Kirisame, he then puts it on his back and shoots himself at them, decapitating an oarfish that was near him. He continues to chase Luffy and Fukaboshi and cuts down more rocks down the ocean floor and the two manage to lose Hody. Luffy tells Fukaboshi to get him onto Noah's deck so he can fight more easily, saying he promised to protect Shirahoshi. Fukaboshi tells Luffy he and his brothers made the same promise, only they could not compete with Hody. He then apologizes for doubting Luffy. Before he can do anything, Hody shoots past them again, saying he would go to the deck first. Noah is now facing bow-up and is directly over Fish-Man Island. Hody reaches the deck and Decken makes small talk, asking how killing Neptune went and how he is torturing Shirahoshi. Hody tells him he has a good idea and Decken wants to hear it. At that moment, Hody suddenly impales him with his trident, asking him what would happen to the ship if he dies.","Shirahoshi, Vander Decken IX, Hody Jones, Monkey D.

Episode 560,A Fierce Fight Begins! Luffy vs. Hody!,19-Aug-12,"Hody takes his trident out of Vander Decken's body and, after a short fight, Decken is defeated. Then, Hody goes after Shirahoshi, slicing through Ryuboshi and Manboshi, reaches her with his incomparable underwater speed, and grabs her hair. Luffy attacks Hody, managing to make him release her.
Zeo makes Wadatsumi believe that he has to fight for the New Fish-Man Pirates in Gyoncorde Plaza. Wadatsumi defeats Surume and then, as he attacks Jinbe and gets pushed back, he manages to bring down Nami, which gives Sanji a reason to attack him.
Hyouzou becomes stronger after eating too many Energy Steroids. He tries to attack Robin but Zoro jumps in front of him and stops his attack.","Hody pulls his trident out of Vander Decken reveals he touched Hody with his left hand at the last minute and throws an axe at him. Hody tells Decken he betrayed him first, but destroying the island was a great idea. If Decken were to die, the effects of his ability would disappear. Hody then suggests turning the ship around and dealing with the Straw Hats. Decken says he does not care about them, since he is going to kill Hody first. He then lashes out with a kick, revealing blades hidden in his shoes. Hody catches the leg with his teeth and bites down on it. He then swings Decken around and uses him as a shield to intercept the axe thrown earlier. Hody laughs and says he has to kill Shirahoshi before the ship crashes.
Ryuboshi and Manboshi see Decken defeated and realize Hody is coming after them. He somersaults past them, cutting them with the blade on his back in the process. Ryuboshi tells his sister to run. Before she can, Hody grabs her hair and stops her, saying even a mermaid cannot beat his speed. Luffy then attacks him with Gomu Gomu no Snake Shot, hitting him in the chest. Luffy pulls back his arm from his perch on Fukaboshi's back.
Back at Gyoncorde Plaza, Wadatsumi has lost the will to fight, crying that his captain abandoned him. Zeo makes up a lie and tells him that he did not hear Decken's orders to take care of the plaza for him. Zeo throws him an Energy Steroid and Wadatsumi starts his rampage, beating Surume and apologizing for doubting his captain. He then sets his sights on Jinbe. Jinbe blocks his fist with his Fish-Man Karate 7000 Brick Roundhouse Kick, stopping the attack with his foot and hurting Wadatsumi's hand in the process. As Wadatsumi falls, everyone around him is blown away as he falls, including Nami. This angers Sanji and he kicks Wadatsumi in the head, confusing him as to who is attacking him now. Sanji tells him he will pay for hurting Nami.
Elsewhere in the plaza, Hyouzou is drunk and starts eating more Energy Steroids while a Fish-Man named Nuru comments this is his chance to become an officer and attacks Zoro. Zoro says he's weak, but Nuru attacks him and tries to kill him and when he blinds him, Zoro dodges and cuts his lightbulb on his head and Zoro sends him flying. While this is going on, Hyouzou goes on a rampage and cuts down Nuru. His appearance changed after eating too many Energy Steroids (just like Hody did) and drinking at the same time. He takes down several people with Chidoriashi Hash. Hyouzou then sets his sights on Robin and charges at her. Zoro appears and blocks the attack (while also cutting Hyouzou's sword with his own), saying he will be taking on Hyouzou, calling him a good warmup for the New World.
Back underwater, Hody tells Luffy he has no chance of winning a fight in the deep sea, saying he cannot protect anything. Luffy says he spent the last two years training to do just that.","Vander Decken IX, Hody Jones, Ryuboshi, Manboshi, Hoe, Shirahoshi, Fukaboshi, Monkey D.

Episode 561,Battle Royal! The Crew vs. the New Fish-Man Pirates!,26-Aug-12,"Luffy along with the three princes try to protect Shirahoshi against Hody Jones, the captain of the New Fish-Man Pirates, focused on killing the Mermaid Princess but seems to have an ulterior motive as Vander Decken IX is slowly losing consciousness and his grip on his Devil Fruit powers that keeps the massive ship Noah from falling on top of Fish-Man Island and its occupants therefore killing them is weakening.
Meanwhile the other Straw Hat Pirates face off against the New Fish-Man Pirates officers who are equally eager to finish their opponents off as everyone prepares for the fight once again as the fate of the people of Fish-Man Island rests on Luffy's hands and his crew. As Luffy and the siblings deal with Hody, Decken falls after trying to throw his axe and passes out and the Noah starts falling to Fish-Man Island.","Wadatsumi is still under the effects of the Energy Steroid he took. Sanji is still mad at him for ""touching Nami with his 'wind pressure'"". Nami is seen emitting several dark colored balls in a string from her Clima-Tact. The pirates wonder if she is a witch, to which she replies they can call her Ms. Magician, but in reality her attack is carefully calculated chemistry. She then attacks everyone around her by swinging the staff, performing an attack called Black Ball: Raiun Rod. Zeo and Ikaros watch as Nami fights. Zeo remembers what Sanji said about her and realizes that Nami must be the crew's weakness. He turns invisible and grabs her ankles and Ikaros comes up to stab her with a spear. As Nami asks for help, Brook appears in front of her, asking to see her panties and takes two blows at once. One from Ikaros' spear, the other from Nami slapping him. The tip of the spear goes into Brook but nothing happens. Brook explains it is because he is already dried up, much to Ikaros's surprise. General Franky, trying to find a worthy opponent appears from behind Ikaros and delivers a heavy punch to his face, knocking him back. Ikaros is mad and says even though he's a squid he has a backbone.
Back with Nami and Brook, Zeo has become visible, and someone tells Brook he is standing on his face. Zeo's appearance explains to Nami why she could not move. Zeo tries to play it off like he tried to headbutt Brook's foot, with a move he calls Super Sole Head Butt. Elsewhere, Daruma is running rampant underground, causing everyone around him to fall into the hollow earth. Daruma is searching for Chopper. Meanwhile, Dosun sees Usopp standing all by himself, telling Chopper to come to where he is. As Dosun is about to attack Usopp, Chopper smells him and tells Usopp to duck, hitting Dosun in the chin with Horn Cannon Elf. Usopp shoots a Pop Green into the hole, using Hissatsu, Midori Boshi: Skull Exploding Grass. The resulting explosion injures a large group of the New Fish-Man Pirates and blasts Daruma out of the hole. Usopp recalls fighting with Miss Merry Christmas back in Arabasta, and how they used the same idea against her. At this point, the officers all decide to take more energy steroids. The spectators are surprised by how well the Straw Hats are fighting. Zoro is briefly seen fighting Hyouzou. Sanji is seen fighting Wadatsumi. Madame Shyarly is then seen looking nervously into the sky.
The scene changes to outside the island. Shirahoshi is still leading Noah away. Hody Jones tells Luffy he is too late to protect everything. Ryuboshi and Manboshi realize what would happen if Vander Decken IX were to die right now. Ryuboshi tells Shirahoshi to swim to one side, and Hody cuts him with Kirisame right after that. Hody says that he wanted Decken's ability to run out here. Luffy realizes what will happen if Noah falls, and tells Fukaboshi to take him to Shirahoshi. Hody stops them, but Manboshi shouts that Shirahoshi broke off to the right. As Hody swims toward her, Luffy grabs him, but due to the seawater, his strength is severely limited. Hody easily breaks away, shouting for Decken to drop dead. Noah has now moved slightly to the side of Fish-Man Island. Inside Noah, Decken is cursing Hody, saying his left hand will never forget him and prepares to throw an axe and try to kill Hody. He is about to say more, but he falls over, hitting his head on the axe and going unconscious. With Decken knocked out, Noah begins to fall back toward Fish-Man Island.","Shirahoshi, Fukaboshi, Monkey D.

Episode 562,Luffy Defeated?! The Hour of Hody's Revenge,2-Sep-12,"As the Noah falls onto the Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi desperately tries to tell Decken to wake up only for Hody to attack her but Manboshi takes the blunt of the attack. Luffy and Hody clash with Luffy sending Hody to the ship after receiving a bite wound. Hody, knowing that Luffy will have the advantage destroys the bubble on the ship leaving Luffy at his mercy but was saved by Fukaboshi. Fukaboshi then fights Hody himself and despite being heavily wounded in the duel demands to know why Hody is doing all this and what humans did to him. Hody smirks and gave him an answer which shocks Fukaboshi leaving him open and stabbed by Hody.
Shirahoshi following Fukaboshi's orders swims away with Luffy next to the Noah and Luffy receives a call from the Ammo Knights at the air tank saying that they have prepared a large air bubble to surround Noah, but stated that they've only got one shot available and it will not slow the ship down. Hody attacks Luffy again but Luffy destroys his Kirisame and sends Hody flying with his Jet Pistol imbued with Haki. Hody then shovels down more Energy Steroids causing him to grow larger and more enraged. Meanwhile, Fukaboshi, barely alive contacts Luffy and states he has discovered who Hody really is.","Hody Jones is rejoicing in Vander Decken IX's defeat and Noah falling toward the island. Fukaboshi says that everything they have done to protect Noah's mission which began centuries ago, would be finished if the ship crushed the island. There is then a short flashback to Neptune explaining that Noah is not just some old wrecked ship. Centuries ago, a promise was made with a ""great man"" to keep the ship on the floor and wait. They have to protect the ship until that day comes. Hody then asks Luffy if he really was serious when he said he would protect everything. He says he is and Luffy declares that he will smash the ship before it gets to the island. Fukaboshi tells Luffy it cannot be destroyed, and says they have to find Decken in case they can make him regain consciousness, saying they could save the island and the ship if they could redirect its course despite Luffy saying they may have no other choice but to destroy it. Shirahoshi calls out to Vander Decken IX, begging him to make the ship chase her again. Manboshi tells her to keep away. Hody uses Fish-Man Karate, Umidaiko to attack Shirahoshi, but Manboshi blocks it. Luffy then grabs Hody from above and draws himself close to Hody. Hody bites him in the shoulder, and Luffy punches him away, leaving his teeth lodged in the shoulder. Luffy mentions that his Busoshoku Haki is good for blunt attacks, but is not strong enough for his body to withstand piercing as he removes the teeth. Hody realizes that Luffy is really after the air in Noah and makes a large cut in the bubble.
The air bubble around Noah is beginning to deflate. Hody chides Luffy, saying that he is just a human and he could not possibly stop Noah, let alone defeat a fish-man like him. He continues to attack Luffy and just as he pops his bubble, Fukaboshi comes in and saves him while throwing him to Shirahoshi. Fukaboshi, while trying to hold the bubble together, asks Hody if he has any idea how many lives he is putting at stake. He then attacks Hody with Ultramarine, but Hody dodges at the last second and delivers a deep cut to Fukaboshi's side. Fukaboshi grabs him again, asking Hody what he is. He is driving the idea of vengeance against humans for oppressing fish-men, and yet he is taking out on Fish-Man Island. He had planned to take over and rule the island, but now he is trying to destroy it. Fukaboshi states that Hody hates humans more than anyone else, and asks what happened to him to make him hate humans so much. Hody tells him, but only his mouth is seen moving, and his answer horrifies Fukaboshi.
As Hody cuts Fukaboshi again, Shirahoshi is forced to swim away and then a voice comes out from a speaker, saying they are the person from the air tank from a Den Den Mushi Luffy has. The voice says he has heard about everything that has transpired and is ready to help, saying everything is ready. Several Ammo Knights appear, and Fukaboshi orders them to go to the air tank and ready the massive air blast that normally goes to the island. Fukaboshi gives Luffy a baby Den Den Mushi and Shirahoshi is seen carrying him in her hand. The plan is to make a big enough air bubble to envelop Noah. This will not make it float, though. Luffy says as long as there is air around Noah it will be fine. Hody attacks Shirahoshi and Luffy with Kirisame, causing her to let go of Luffy. Luffy manages to break off the scythe blade on Hody's fin, then punches him with haki. Hody swallows more Energy Steroids, gets revitalized and grows even larger with an enlarged mouth and declares he will get his revenge on humans no matter what. Noah is almost within range of the air tank. Fukaboshi then speaks to Luffy through the baby Den Den Mushi, saying he knows who Hody ""really is"".","Hody Jones, Monkey D.

Episode 563,Shocking Truth! Hody's True Identity!,9-Sep-12,"The story goes back before the Noah started falling back to the island. Jinbe and Sanji continue to fight Wadatsumi and Wadatsumi becomes angry and inflates himself, crushing some of his allies unknowingly. Sanji goads him into growing larger after saying he's smaller than Surume.
At that time, Neptune is greeted by some of his soldiers and the Minister of the Left, who apologizes for not protecting him. The Minister of the Right arrives at the plaza with some of the army and is informed of the situation. They join the battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates officially, allying themselves with the Straw Hats and Jinbe claiming they've made a terrible mistake for blaming them. Hammond is using human pirates as slaves in his Slave Tank and Jinbe asks Robin to free them and she agrees. She frees them and easily defeats Hammond with her Double Clutch, breaking his back. The freed slaves then revolt against the New Fish-Man Pirates and ally themselves with the Straw Hat Crew. The Minister of the Left gets in touch with the Air Tank and is informed of the situation. He orders an evacuation of the island and the all citizens attempt to leave the island.
At that time, the whole island can hear Luffy's talk with the soldiers, Shirahoshi and Fukaboshi stating he knows who Hody Jones really is. He states Hody is a monster born from their environment. He states the officers are all the same and how they are just monsters born of hatred born from their ancestors and they fear their hatred will fade one day and so will their hatred towards humans and want them to be evil to justify their actions not even wanting peace for Fish-Men. He recalls what he asked what Humans did to Hody and Hody answers ""nothing"" and that they've been chosen by the heavens to punish humans and granted power. He goes on to state that their hatred is not from beliefs or experience but they are nothing but empty opponents. At that time, Hody laughs maniacally and with blood-shot eyes he charges at Luffy and Shirahoshi.","Sanji and Jinbe continue to attack Wadatsumi and hurt him. Angry, Wadatsumi breathes in and expands his stomach, calling himself ""Mega Monk"", becoming even larger than before. Sanji asks if that had a point, saying the kraken is still bigger than him. This angers Wadatsumi and he expands even more, crushing everything within range. Sanji is still unimpressed, and Wadatsumi is about to expand again.
The Minister of the Left and some soldiers approach the place where Neptune is resting. The minister apologizes, saying they have let him down. Neptune mentions that if Noah hits the island, it would be just as it was written. The Minister of the Left tells Neptune about the evacuation and encourages the king to leave as well. Neptune says the orders are fine but he will stay and wait for the princes.
At Gyoncorde Plaza, the Minister of the Right and more troops are surveying the battle from the perimeter of the plaza, confused as to why there are so many pirates. Some bystanders get him up to speed about what happened before he arrived. The Minister of the Right orders the Neptune Army to back up the Straw Hat Pirates in the plaza, saying the country's honor would be shattered if they were backed up solely by a gang of pirates. The arrival of the army does not intimidate the New Fish-Man Pirates at all. Hammond then arrives, riding something he calls his slave tank, essentially a large rickshaw with cannons, pulled by human slaves. One of the slaves falls over exhausted and Hammond just says to leave him. Jinbe asks Robin to free the slaves, saying he cannot sit back and watch Hody copy the World Nobles. She frees the slaves and as Hammond attacks her, she was just a clone and grows two clones of herself and uses a Double Clutch and breaks Hammond's back. The human slaves state they owe her and revolt against the New Fish-Man Pirates.
As the battle rages on, the Minister of the Left receives a call on a baby Den Den Mushi from the border defense. The border defense informs the minister that Noah is once again on a collision course for the island. The Minister of the Left tells the person to tell the whole island, using the nationwide broadcast. They make the announcement and people start fleeing. Nami is shocked to see Noah coming back, and Jinbe wonders if Shirahoshi and Luffy are safe. The man from the Air Tank then talks to Luffy, and their conversation is picked up on other channels. Bits of a conversation between Luffy and Shirahoshi are heard. All over the island, people are surprised at what they are hearing. Luffy is attempting to do something to stop Noah. Then Fukaboshi's voice is heard through broadcast system. He tells Luffy what Hody Jones really is.
Fukaboshi tells Luffy, as well as the rest of the island, that Hody is a monster born from their environment. The New Fish-Man Pirates are a group that thrive on hatred and resentment. They hate in order to forget the pain of those who came before them. They also fear that the anger and hate toward humans may one day fade away. There is then a flashback to when Fukaboshi asked Hody what happened to him to make him hate humans so much. The answer that Hody had only been seen mouthing earlier was a single word: ""Nothing"". Hody goes on to say that the fish-men were chosen by heaven to hand down judgment on humanity. Fukaboshi then says that the New Fish-Man Pirates' hatred lacks personal experience and will. They are just empty beings with no substance what so ever and their hatred is completely empty. Hody begins to laugh maniacally and with blood-shot eyes he charges at Luffy and Shirahoshi.","Fukaboshi, Wadatsumi, Sanji, Jinbe, Neptune, Minister of the Left, Ammo Knights, Minister of the Right, Surume (K.O), Brook, Zeo, Nami, Hammond, Nico Robin, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Octopako, Franky, Hody Jones, Shirahoshi, Monkey D.

Episode 564,To Zero! Passionate Desire to Luffy!,16-Sep-12,"As Fukaboshi begins to state who Hody really is, Hody's past is revealed as he recalls his hatred towards humans. The New Fish-Man Pirates officers were taught as children that the humans are an inferior species and that they should be punished by heaven.
Time moves to when Hody was a Neptune Army member and he and his crew commit crimes, celebrate the death of Otohime, and start producing Energy Steroids. As the flashback ends, Fukaboshi laments how his mother was killed by the hatred of the Fish-Man Island and begs Luffy to reset their history to zero. Luffy gladly accepts because of his recent vow not to let anyone harm the island followed with saying that they are friends.
Luffy prepares to attack Hody. Franky continues fighting Ikaros Much. Chopper continues to fight Dosun, revealing his new Heavy point. Zoro continues to fight Hyouzou and is mocking him by saying that he cannot even kill his boredom.","The whole island is in a panic as the evacuation continues and the impending arrival of Noah looms ever closer. People are confused by what Fukaboshi is saying about Hody. Outside the island, Hody is laughing hysterically as he chases Luffy and Shirahoshi, his muscles continuing to expand. Shirahoshi remarks he looks even scarier than before. Hody then has a flashback.
In the Fish-Man District, a fish-man is preaching in the street about how humans are an inferior species that is running rampant and threatening fish-menkind. A very young Hody Jones listens to this and seems to take it to heart. The scene changes to a fish-man talking about someone blowing up a slave shop on the surface. A memorial wreath is in front of a large picture of the fish-man in question. People are standing around it, saying that he died, but took eight humans with him and caused widespread disaster on the surface. Hody comments that it serves the humans right, and Ikaros Much praises the man, saying he wants to be a hero too and the future New Fish-Man Pirate officers all listen and take this to heart. The scene changes to another time in the Fish-Man District, where someone is saying Arlong sank a human pirate ship and has returned. Arlong is talking to Hody and the others about how fish-men were chosen by heaven to get rid of the trash that is humanity. The humans feared this, so they decided to persecute the fish-men. In the end the humans won because of their superior numbers. Hody continues to listen to this and becomes warped by it and must remember the hatred, resentment and the grudge against humans and takes this as his pride for life.
Later, Hatchan is telling Hody, Shyarly, and some other children about a human friend he has on the surface, Silvers Rayleigh, and speaking highly of him. Hody turns and leaves, saying Hatchan's story makes him want to vomit. A few years pass and some time with the incident with Tiger, someone is talking about the recent death of Fisher Tiger. Zeo comments that Tiger wasn't the chosen one either. At the late night, the New Fish-Man Pirate officers are then seen wearing black leather masks, leading a group of people holding torches. They approach a fish-man's home. The man had donated blood to a human, and that would not be tolerated. They burned his house to the ground and strangled the man in front of his family.
The scene changes to Hody, now a member of the army, talking to the officers. He was saying that everyone from the royal family on down has lost their minds and yielded to humans. Ikaros asks if Hody heard about Jinbe joining the Shichibukai. Dosun says that Arlong and his crew is the only true pirates left that hold the pride of Fish-Men. In the next scene, someone cries out that the main island is in a panic, saying that Otohime was assassinated by a human (not knowing that Hody was the one who actually committed the murder and framed the human for the crime). The Fish-Man in the Fish-Man District became angry at the royal family for not doing anything. Hody and the officers are then seen toasting beer saying the shameless have been judged and that it is the natural order for those who yield to humans to die. Hody then puts a bag on the table, saying heaven has given them power. The officers are shocked at what they see. Hody asks Zeo if he can mass produce them, and Zeo says he will try. They are next seen with the New Fish-Man Pirates jolly roger, saying they will dedicate their lives to killing humans.
The flashback ends. Hody tells Luffy he has given up his life this vengeance. In the air tank, the guards are taking aim at Noah through a crosshair. They fire the bubble. Fukaboshi is then seen realizing that he has failed. They have cast off the emotions of fish-men, exiling them to the Fish-Man District, ignoring the grudge that was slowly growing among them. They were focusing too much on progress. He then remembers his mother saying people should not pass on their hate to their children, but he realizes that has already happened. People must first fight within themselves. He then tearfully declares that Otohime was killed by Fish-Man Island's grudge. The regrets of the dead should stay with the dead and regrets how deep down he held resentment towards humans for killing his mother. A grudge is something people make to feed on others, and the grudge of the Fish-Man District has been fed by their hatred for humanity. By the time anyone noticed, it had grown too big to contain and states that the Fish-Man Island will be killed by the hatred of the island. He then tells Luffy that they do not need the past, and asks him to bring everything back to zero, to purge the old ghosts living in the shadows. He asks Luffy to bring the island back to zero. The guards in the air tank are celebrating, as the bubble has successfully surrounded Noah.
Hody tells Fukaboshi he can talk all he wants, but hatred is eternal. Luffy tells Fukaboshi through the baby Den Den Mushi to let him take care of this, and he can take a seat and relax. He tells Fukaboshi, as well as everyone on the island through the intercom, that from the moment they entered the plaza they decided they would not let anyone touch the island and to leave everything to them; adding that they are friends after all, which bring tears of happiness into Fukaboshi's eyes. The residents suddenly stop running. The Minister of the Right looks up and wonders if Luffy is the kind of human they doubted. Touched by Luffy's words, some of the residents decided to stay on the island until the end of the battle. Luffy tells Shirahoshi to stay by his side and he will not let her get hurt and prepares to end things with Hody once and for all and will not let anything happen to the island.
With the other Straw Hats, Ikaros Much is using a spitting attack on Franky, calling it The Wings of Ikaros. Franky punches him but it just goes through, as Ikaros reappears behind Franky saying that was his squid ink clone. Franky uses Franky Fireball and Ikaros narrowly dodges. Chopper and Dosun match each other with Heavy Gong and T-Shot, respectively, causing Zoro and Chopper joke about how he looks like a monster. Just then, Hyouzou comes at Zoro, saying he will chop up anyone who laughs. Zoro intercepts the attack and cuts off several of his swords' blades perfectly at the hilts, asking for the strongest swordsman on Fish-Man Island. He then states that the octopus merman could not even kill Zoro's boredom.","Ammo Knights, Shirahoshi, Hody Jones, Monkey D.

Usopp continues to fight Daruma and has set traps for him. Luffy attacks Hody with a new move called Red Hawk and it deals Hody an incredible amount of damage and sends him flying to the Noah.
The guards announce Hody's defeat and the lower members try to run away with their captain defeated and Zeo stops them, wanting them to die for their grudge. The lower members note how insane the officers are and the children wonder if humans are really that bad and Shyarly states not all are and it is for them to judge humans with their own eyes.

He manages to break Brook's neck off, however, as his head falls, he remembers tapping into the true powers of the Yomi Yomi no Mi during his training. He learned of a powerful energy that allows his soul to stay in this world, despite having died once already, and how he has gained control of his very soul. While Zeo is celebrating his victory, Brook remembers that it is the power of soul that is keeping him alive, and reattaches his head to his body while thinking this, stunning Zeo. Brook tells him that his attacks will not harm bone and brings out his new sword called Sword Solid and states it is a freezing sword he had made with his soul poured into it. Usopp continues to fight Daruma and lays traps for him while Daruma uses a move called Fireball Cutter and lunges at Usopp while on fire and Usopp dodges and shoots some Pop Greens despite Daruma believing they're duds.
Luffy prepares to end things with Hody and unleashes a new move called Red Hawk and the move devastates Hody and causes an explosion through his back which rockets him to the Noah and has Shirahoshi take him there stating it's not over yet.
The guards start to celebrate by telling the island of Hody's presumed defeat causing the lower members of the crew to panic and run away having lost the will to fight. Zeo suddenly stops them and attacks them with his chains. He throws his chain at another pirate who tried to argue. Zeo tells the pirates to die and let their deaths curse the humans. Their grudge will never fade as long as it gets passed on. The pirates think the officers have gone crazy. Dosun comes down with his hammer on one of the pirates, saying they are only crazy because the humans made them that way. The children wonder if humans are really that bad and Shyarly tells them not to think that and judge what they think of humans with their own eyes. Brook stops Zeo from attacking his men and states he cannot stand people like him and he should not talk about dying as if it is that easy since nothing is left behind when he dies. Brook places his faith in Luffy and knows nothing will happen to the island and everything will be fine and prepares to end things with Zeo. Franky prepares to end things with Ikaros Much, Sanji and Jinbe prepare to end things with Wadatsumi now that he is large enough now and Zoro walks away from Hyouzou since he is bored with him while Hyouzou seems to prepare some poison. Usopp tells Daruma he will finish him in three moves and Daruma says he is lying, and Usopp admits that he used to lie a lot, but adds that he cannot do that anymore, as he now has it within himself to back up his claims. At that moment, the both of them are then shocked to see Chopper in his Monster Point, only for Chopper to reveal he is in full control now.
At the Noah, Hody is recovering, but is seriously injured by the Red Hawk attack and as Luffy makes his way to the ship, Hody attempts to force in more Energy Steroids, despite his wounds being too serious he ends up puking some out and just forces them to stay in his mouth as Luffy prepares to end things with the New Fish-Man Pirates captain.","Brook, Zeo, Usopp, Roronoa Zoro, Pappag (flashback), Daruma, Monkey D.

Episode 566,It's Finally Settled! The Final Decisive Battle Against Hody,30-Sep-12,"Hody recovers thanks to the Energy Steroids and manages to overwhelm Luffy and bite him again in the same spot. Luffy retorts with another Red Hawk, but Hody is still standing. Chopper reveals he now only needs one Rumble Ball for his Monster Point. Usopp, Franky, Sanji and Jinbe prepare to end things with their opponents. Luffy attacks Hody with Elephant Gun and Hody is sent crashing into the Noah and is finally defeated. He wishes for the Noah to destroy the island and all the Fish-Man who've lost their pride.
Brook finishes Zeo off. Usopp finishes Daruma off. Chopper finishes Dosun off with his claws. Franky blasts Ikaros Much with his laser beam. Jinbe sends Wadatsumi flying and Sanji finishes him off. Hyouzou attempts to attack Zoro from behind only for Zoro to counter and destroy his swords again and defeat him thinking he was a frog. Luffy uses Elephant Gatling on the ship and Hody is blasted out unconscious as Luffy attempts to destroy the ship.","On the Noah, Hody takes more Energy Steroids and recovers. As Luffy comments on Hody's toughness, the bite wound Hody gave him is affecting him and Hody tells Luffy that he knows his fangs did more damage than Luffy is letting on. Hody charges at Luffy only for Luffy to use a Gear 2 punch which Hody dodges at bliding speed due to consuming more pills. Hody grabs Luffy's arms and knees him back to the ship. Shirahoshi is worried and Luffy retorts with a Jet Bazooka only for Hody to take it unaffected and bite Luffy again in the same spot. Luffy uses Red Hawk to force Hody to let him go and sends Hody back with not as much damage due to the pills, prompting Fukaboshi to comment on how much of a monster Hody has become. The Ammo Knights announce Luffy is still fighting. As everyone hears this and worry about the Noah, Shyarly looks up at the sky nervously, remembering her vision. Zeo berates Brook claiming that Hody would never lose to a mere human since Hody is invincible, but Brook replies by saying he has faith in his captain and that Luffy will save everyone.
Usopp is shocked that Chopper can control his transformation. Chopper explains that by eating a single Rumble Ball, he can fight in this form for three minutes. Usopp says that this form is now an asset, which causes Chopper to act embarrassed in his transformed state - an action which Usopp says is creepy. Dosun tells Chopper he will still knock him into the ocean no matter how big he gets. Daruma gets mad that Usopp would be so rude as to stop in the middle of their fight to talk to someone else. The scene changes to Franky and Ikaros Much. Ikaros reveals that he has a spear on his head that can pierce anything. He then uses Light Strike Usubon no Yari, preparing to attack. Franky tells Ikaros that he should just give up as his attacks will be useless. Elsewhere, Zoro walks away from Hyouzou, saying he cannot cut anyone who has no fighting spirit, calling him a frog. Hyouzou grins and then lunges at Zoro with eight new swords. Meanwhile, Sanji is still standing on Wadatsumi's face, and the giant fish-man tells him that if he were to roll into the plaza right now, every one of Sanji's friends would be crushed. Jinbe appears to be getting ready to attack as the scene switches over to Luffy and Hody. Luffy says that he will end this as Hody attacks with Hody Jones uses Fish-Man Jiu-Jitsu Water Heart Shark Pack. Luffy yells at Shirahoshi to get back. Hody launches large amounts of water in the shape of sharks at Luffy, but he dodges. However, a few hit Luffy and as he's sent down towards the ship, Hody starts thinking that he's won, only for Luffy to use Gear 3 and Elephant Gun. Hody counters with Shark Pack and Luffy's fist goes through, finally defeating Hody. Hody's last conscious thought is for Noah to crash into the island and kill all the fish-man who've lost their pride. Luffy then uses Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gatling, pulverizing the bridge section of Noah while Shirahoshi starts worrying over Luffy as his wound opens up.
Back in the plaza, Brook continues to fight Zeo as Zeo has drawn a circle around himself and tells Brook he will be crushed to bits if he enters it. Zeo then hears humming behind him and Brook appears, asking to be excused as he has already entered the circle and cut him. Before Zeo can do anything, Brook's cut takes effect as he unleashes a new move called Song of Scratches - Blizzard Slice. A single cut now runs from Zeo's waist to the top of his head with the afflicted area apparently having been frozen. Brook then says that cut is the first line and even blood freezes in the winds of Hell. He also says he hopes that the wind lifts up some skirts, too. The scene goes back to Usopp and Daruma. As Daruma flies at Usopp, several flowers come out of the ground and move towards him. Usopp explains that they are called Humandrakes, and they hide in the ground and attack anyone heard above them. The flowers beat Daruma to the ground, but he somehow gets thrown into the air away from them. Usopp reveals another plant, Trampoilia, a large flower that launches anything that gets near it. Usopp tells Daruma there is nowhere left for him to run and he is completely exposed. Usopp has launched a Pop Green that takes the shape of a giant wolf. Daruma says he will just bite through it. Usopp tells him that would be a bad idea since the bulb on the tip of its nose emits a very powerful shockwave that has a three meter diameter. Daruma is then hit with the shockwave known as Impact Wolf. In the Dosun and Chopper fight, Dosun swings his hammer around, getting ready to launch Chopper into the sea with Papara Hammer. Chopper then uses Carving Holf-Palme. The attack shatters Dosun's hammer and sends him flying, much to the shock of the pirates watching. Ikaros gets ready to launch his piercing attack. Franky then cups his hands one over the other in a similar pose to Coup De Vent, and launches the Franky Radical Beam. Usopp and Chopper watch it with stars in their eyes, while Nami and Robin stare at it seemingly unimpressed. Ikaros comes out of the attack completely blackened and defeated.
Jinbe prepares to use a Fish-Man Karate technique by surrounding his right hand in water. He then hits Wadatsumi with Vegabond Drill. The attack enters on one side of Wadatsumi and explodes out of the other side. Wadatsumi begins rolling away, but as he cannot hold his breath any longer, the air he took in is released and he blasts himself away. Sanji is ready for this, and follows Wadatsumi into the sky. Sanji then takes a moment to prepare by thinking back to the torture he had to go through the last two years, before catching completely on fire. He then kicks Wadatsumi in the stomach with Hell Memories, a fire-attack so powerful it completely chars Wadatsumi. As Wadatsumi falls back to the ground, Sanji says that when preparing blowfish, one must take care to remove the poisonous parts. Finally, Hyouzou attacks Zoro with swords dripping with poison. As he leaps at Zoro, he tells him that he is Fish-Man Island's number one Hachitoryu user and Zoro should not forget that. Zoro slices through him using Rengoku Onigiri, saying he was sorry but he mistook Hyouzou for a ""frog at the bottom of a well"" - a Japanese proverb for someone ignorant of the real world.
On the Noah, Luffy has sent Hody out of the ship unconscious as the guards announce Hody's defeat and Luffy attempting to destroy the Noah to save the island. With that, Hody and his officers have all been defeated.","Monkey D.

Episode 567,"Stop, Noah! Elephant Gatling of Desperation!",7-Oct-12,"All of the New Fish-Man Pirates lie down defeated while the Straw Hat Pirates are relaxing and waiting for Luffy. All the citizens of Fish-Man Island are cheering for him to destroy Noah and thus saving them. While some citizens evacuate the island, some recall how Whitebeard also saved the island at a point in the past and how Luffy reminds them of him. Luffy keeps attacking Noah intent on destroying it while Neptune laments being unable to keep the promise with Joy Boy, stating there is no choice but to destroy it. As Luffy continues to destroy the Noah, Shirahoshi jumps in front of him telling him to stop which he eventually does. He realizes that Noah has been brought to a halt by Sea Kings. However, he suddenly faints, falling back down to the Noah. The Sea Kings acknowledge the strength of Luffy's will. After everyone understands that Noah has been stopped, they start celebrating.","The residents are amazed that the Straw Hat Pirates were able to defeat all the top members of the New Fish-Man Pirates. Everyone then runs out of the way as Wadatsumi falls from the sky. Back on the ground Jinbe is not surprised by the results of the Straw Hat Pirates' strength. Meanwhile, Sanji and Zoro get into an argument, Chopper and Usopp admire Sanji and Franky respectively, but Franky feels inferior to Chopper's Monster Point form, Robin chastises Franky's Franky Shogun stating it was useless, and Brook asks Nami to put on a miniskirt, much to her annoyance. All the citizens are starting to relax until they remember Noah is about to crash down on them.
They beg Luffy to do something and save them. Luffy uses Elephant Gatling and begins to smash Noah as fast as he can. The citizens stand their ground and put their trust in Luffy. While Luffy is destroying the ship, a citizen recalls how Luffy reminded one fish-man of when he was a child and Whitebeard befriended Neptune and declared the island his territory. There is then a flashback to when Whitebeard first appeared and declared the island under his control. The man is asked if he really believes that Luffy is like Whitebeard. The man said he hates humans but does not know what to think since a human is now defending the country. Shyarly looks up at the sky nervously, remembering her prediction of a man in a straw hat will bring destruction to Fish-Man Island. Fukaboshi and Neptune are sorry to have to destroy the ship, but lives must come first and Neptune apologizes to Joy Boy. As Luffy continues his barrage on the ship, Shirahoshi begs him to stop and blocks him. Luffy says the island will be destroyed if she does not get out of the way, but she tells him the ship has already stopped as they become surrounded by Sea Kings holding the chains from Noah in their mouths, much to Luffy's shock.
At this point, Luffy's wounds begin to open up, but he says it is okay as long as the ship stopped and everyone is safe. He then faints and falls back down to Noah. The Sea Kings begin to talk about how amazing Luffy was and if they came only a bit later Fish-Man Island would have been saved, but Noah would have been destroyed. Shirahoshi says she did not do anything to call them there and the Sea Kings tell her that they were guided there by her strong feelings to help Luffy.
The royal guards tell everyone on Fish-Man Island that the Sea Kings stopped the ship before it could be completely destroyed and that Fish-Man Island is saved.

Meanwhile, the missing and captured mermaids have been found but they have been replaced with some other valuable items from the Palace. The remaining humans and New Fish-Man Pirates are being rounded up and caught by the Straw Hat Crew and Jinbe, while Shirahoshi rescues a collapsed and unconscious Luffy from Noah's remains. However, if Luffy is to survive from his injuries taken from his battle with Hody Jones and his unsuccessful destruction of Noah, the only thing that can save him is a blood transfusion, but the merfolk are reluctant to donate blood as it is forbidden in Fish-Man Island to give blood to a human. Jinbe volunteers, stating that he is a pirate. The episode ends with Luffy asking Jinbe to join his crew.","After the Sea Kings stop Noah, it is revealed by them that Shirahoshi is actually their queen ever since she was born. At the same time, the royal guards report the current situation to the Minister of the Left, and Neptune states that the power to destroy the world has finally awakened. The three princes get ready to capture Hody Jones and Vander Decken IX. While the sea kings are taking the Noah away from Fish-Man Island, they talk about how Luffy could hear their voices, comparing him to the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. As they relocate the Noah to the Sea Forest, they leave wondering if the Noah can be fixed by the ""appointed time"".
Meanwhile, at the royal palace, the kidnapped mermaids are found, however they've been traded for the entire contents of the treasure chamber, including the national treasure - the Tamate box. Nonetheless, Neptune disregards this information, saying that they nearly lost the whole nation just now, and that they need to clear the Straw Hats' names because they have been wrongly accused.
Down on the battlefield, the humans and New Fish-Man Pirates are stopped by Jinbe while they try to get away. As they plan on escaping him with their bubbles, Jinbe shoots a water shot, stating that he will attack anyone who tries to escape. The Minister of the Left proclaims that they take full responsibility for making a mistake with their fact-checking process. As the merfolk exclaim that they never suspected the Straw Hats anyways, they are ashamed when the kids point out that they blamed and didn't trust them the whole time because they were humans. The three princes return from the outside with a battered Hody Jones and Vander Decken IX, and announce that they won't allow them to cause any trouble again.
Whilst the merfolk are celebrating, they are interrupted by a crying Shirahoshi, sobbing about Luffy's injuries and how his bleeding won't stop. Chopper announces that Luffy needs a transfusion, but the merfolk are reluctant to donate blood as it is against the law to give blood to a human. Jinbe steps up, offering his own blood, since he is a pirate and does not need to obey the laws.
As the blood is flowing through the tube, there are flashbacks from the last moments of Fisher Tiger, Otohime and Whitebeard, three important figures that nearly succeeded in bringing peace between humans and merfolk. When the blood finally reaches Luffy, he smiles, and while everyone is rejoicing at the fact that he's alive, he invites Jinbe to join his crew.","Monkey D.

Episode 569,Revealed Secret - The Truth of Ancient Weapons,21-Oct-12,"As the whole Fish-Man Island celebrates the capture and defeat of Hody and the New Fish-Man Pirates by the Straw Hat Pirates, who make their own plans to leave Fish-Man Island soon while Jinbe reluctantly tells Luffy that he cannot join his crew at the moment but he will in the future when he is finished his own tasks and obligations. They are all soon called to celebrate their victory at the Ryugu Palace with the banquet that was originally planned.
As the party begins to wind down, Robin asks and discusses a troubling and dangerous secret with King Neptune surrounding his daughter, Shirahoshi, the ship Noah, and the mysterious Joy Boy. Robin reveals the location of the ancient weapon from Skypiea she read two years ago being on Fish-Man Island and that Poseidon is on the island and deduces that the Mermaid Princess during the Void Century name was Poseidon and discovers that Shirahoshi is the now current ancient weapon, Poseidon.","The royal family have made a decision to release the human slaves that were under Hody's control as they were only on this island for resting and traveling like other pirates. The rest of the New Fish-Man Pirates have also been released however they cannot go back to the Fish-Man District. They are ordered to live on the main island working for the king, under the supervision of the Neptune army stating they will not let the Fish-Man District get out of control again. From this day forward, the Fish-Man District will be sealed off and nobody will be allowed to enter. Neptune then asks Fukaboshi where Luffy is and he says Luffy ran away with the others.
The scene changes to the Straw Hats, who are flying above the island on the Thousand Sunny, still toting its bubble balloon. Shirahoshi is following along side the ship, and asks why they left in such a hurry. Zoro is mad at himself for fighting in that big of an open area. He tells Shirahoshi if they had stayed any longer, the people would have lifted them up like heroes, shivering at the thought. Zoro tells Shirahoshi that heroes have to share their alcohol, something which he does not want to do. Nami is appalled to hear Zoro reciting the same reason Luffy told Jinbe. Looking over her shoulder, Nami sees Luffy trying to convince Jinbe to join the crew. Jinbe replies that he cannot join, but is very happy to be asked. He tells them that he has some business that he has been putting off for a long time. After he has taken care of it, he promises he will come back to them and asked them to promise to invite him again, should they still see him fit to join. Sanji tells Luffy not to back Jinbe into a corner. Robin remarks that he has taken a liking to the crew. And Franky remarks that of course they would wait for a man who captivated Luffy as much as Jinbe did. Zoro then asks if they should head to the New World now. Shirahoshi is upset by their departure and asks them to stay so she can thank them all. Sanji uses this opportunity to propose staying at the Mermaid Cafe for a whole week. Usopp slaps him, saying there is only one reason Sanji would go there, but he does agree with him.
An Ammo Knight calls out to them, and then informs Neptune via baby Den Den Mushi that they caught up to the Straw Hats' ship. Through the Den Den Mushi, Neptune tells Luffy he wants to pick up where he left off with the banquet he initially promised. Luffy agrees, and tells Neptune he will get Hatchan and Camie as well.
The scene changes briefly to the Fish-Man District, where all the buildings have been wrapped in yellow tape. It then goes to Ryugu Palace, where Hody, his officers, and Vander Decken IX are all in a prison cell, still unconscious. At the main entrance to the island, guards are telling Surume to carry Wadatsumi to the far ends of the earth, telling the giant fish-man that they do not have a cell that can hold him, and that he is banished from the island. In Coral Hill, people are preparing food to bring to the palace banquet. They are carrying large racks of Sea King meat, boxes of seaweed cakes and other sweets, and alcohol by the cartload, enough to bathe in, as one fish-man put it.
At the palace, the Straw Hats and their guests are being carried on two large flounders to the banquet hall, a completely inundated room, which makes some of the Straw Hats nervous. Below them on the floor packed with soldiers, guards cheer and say the heroes have arrived. Luffy tells not to call them heroes as he is going to eat all the meat. Shirahoshi points out a stage in the front of the room to Luffy, and they notice someone standing on it. The woman on stage is introduced as Maria Napole, a singer called the diva of the ocean floor and the pride of the island. Maria Napole begins to sing, and her voice completely entrances Nami and Usopp, who feel as if they could melt from hearing it. Brook gets excited, as he notices Maria Napole's accompaniment, a jazz quintet. The music starts up, and then it is Sanji's turn to be in awe, as the Mermaid Cafe dancers are introduced. More mermaids come in carrying trays of food that they take to the Straw Hats and the rest of the people in attendance. Everyone is singing, dancing, cheering, and enjoying the festivities. Pappag is dancing with the Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets. Luffy and Jinbe are eating and laughing with two other mermaids. Zoro, Franky, and Hatchan toast gourds of alcohol. Sanji turns to stone in the arms of two mermaids, while another one grabs Brook and starts kissing him on the cheek. Luffy is then seen having a toast with Usopp, Neptune, Shirahoshi, Camie, Jinbe, and the Minister of the Right. All the soldiers raise their glasses high. Robin is seen laughing and drinking with the Minister of the Left. Brook is playing his guitar on stage with Maria Napole. Nami is seen celebrating her victory against Fukaboshi in a drinking contest, while Ryuboshi and Manboshi dance together.
Robin is then seen standing just outside the banquet hall, when Neptune, a bit tipsy from drinking, stumbles out. He asks Robin what she wanted to talk to him about. Robin apologizes, saying she thought they would be able to be alone. Neptune, thinking she was coming on to him, starts telling Robin he could never betray the love he has for his wife, dead though she may be. Before he can go on, Robin cuts him off, asking who Joy Boy is. Neptune drops his gourd in surprise. Robin goes on to tell him that she read the poneglyph in the Sea Forest, and then asks Neptune who he was and what he was apologizing for. Neptune, instantly sobering up, is surprised Robin can read poneglyphs. Robin explains she is from Ohara and Neptune does not have to tell her anything he does not want to. Neptune says he will tell her what he knows stating he knows he can trust her.
Neptune explains that Joy Boy was a person from the surface who lived during the Void Century. His message was for the Mermaid Princess living on the island at that time. It is an apology for breaking his side of a promise he made with the island. Neptune tells her he does not know the details of the promise, only that some day someone is supposed to come and carry out the promise made by Joy Boy. He explains it is a legend passed down in the royal family. Neptune says that their promise to Joy Boy was to watch Noah and keep it safe. Only when the promised time comes will Noah's purpose be known. Robin tells Neptune that she heard that Noah, after the events in and above Gyoncorde Plaza, was carried to the Sea Forest by Sea Kings. Robin asks Neptune if Joy Boy could control Sea Kings. Neptune tells her that ability belongs to the Mermaid Princess from then and now. Robin then concludes that Shirahoshi has the ability, confirming her theory. Neptune says she is right, and today that ability was fully awakened, which is not a good thing. Robin agrees. She then tells Neptune about the Poneglyph she read while in Skypiea two years ago. It gave the location of one of the ancient weapons, and said it was located on Fish-Man Island. She then asks Neptune if the Mermaid Princess from Joy Boy's time went by another name. Neptune starts to understand and begins to become fearful of what he's about to listen to. Robin tells him that Shirahoshi, by having the same ability, also inherited the same name as that princess. Her other name is the ancient weapon, Poseidon.","Hody Jones (K.O.), Vander Decken IX (K.O.), Dosun (K.O.), Zeo (K.O.), Minister of the Right, Minister of the Left, Neptune, Wadatsumi (K.O.), Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi, Manboshi, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Luffy regroups with the rest of the crew away from the party after Jinbe insists that he wants to talk to him and explains that Akainu fought against Aokiji for the title of Fleet Admiral on a certain island. Akainu won the title and Aokiji left since he did not want to work under Akainu. He then explains the two changes that happened in the New World after two years: Akainu becoming fleet admiral and Marshall D. Teach taking all of Whitebeard's territories and claiming the title of Emperor alongside Shanks, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou. Jinbe also tells of a rumor that Blackbeard is searching for the strongest Devil Fruits so he can extract their abilities and claim them for his own use. Luffy does not pay attention to Jinbe's announcements and instead asks Camie where Shirahoshi is, to which she replies that she is in her room.
Luffy senses a ""big animal"" in the palace so he calls Zoro and Sanji to come with him and they find Caribou using his Logia powers to capture Shirahoshi. Luffy kicks him out and Minister of the Right thanks him once again. The Minister of the Right wonders why the tower has been cut into pieces and Pappag says that Zoro did it and Zoro gets mad.
Meanwhile in Hody Jones's cell, Hody and his gang appear to be aged by the Energy Steroids and still want revenge against the royal family and humans. The Minister of the Left gets news that Baron Tamago and Pekoms, crew members of the Big Mom Pirates, are on Fish-Man Island. The Minister of the Left claims that Big Mom will destroy the island if they do not give her candy.","Robin and Neptune continue their conversation, and Robin mentions that there are three ancient weapons: Pluton, Uranus, and Poseidon. Neptune then warns her not to tell anyone about Shirahoshi in fear that the government and pirates would hunt her. However, Caribou is eavesdropping on their conversation and goes to kidnap Shirahoshi. Meanwhile, Jinbe tells Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates about the major events that took place during the timeskip. The first is Aokiji and Akainu's duel to decide who will become the new fleet admiral, which Akainu won after ten days of fighting. As a result, Aokiji left the Marines. The second is Blackbeard, who conquered all the Whitebeard Pirates' territory and claimed the seat of Emperor in the process he also began his hunt of Devil Fruit users to obtain their powers. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji then leave the conversation to check on Shirahoshi.
The trio find Caribou in the process of kidnapping Shirahoshi and Luffy proceeds to kick him from the tower. After hearing from Neptune that Caribou stole the treasure, he tells Nami that he will give it to them as a reward for saving his country if they can get it back. After Nami finds out that Luffy had kicked Caribou out of the tower, she sends Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji after him so she can have the treasure.
Neptune is then told by one of his soldiers that something has happened to Hody and his crew. When he reaches their prison cell, he finds Hody Jones and the New Fish-Man Pirates have become very old and are planning on taking their revenge against the Straw Hats. The Minister of the Right deduces that the Energy Steroids, which came from inside the Tamatebako (national treasure of Fish-Man Island), are the cause and Hody confesses that he stole them. Neptune then tells them to forget about their intention of seeking revenge against humans considering the state that they are in and says he will have to re-think their punishment.
Meanwhile, a soldier comes to the Minister of the Left, reporting that two of Big Mom's men have come to the island to collect her monthly candy payment. Unfortunately, because the candy factory was destroyed by the New Fish-Man Pirates and the remaining sweets were sent to the party, there is not enough candy for Big Mom this month. The Minister of the Left is then worried about Big Mom's reaction, saying that she is ""a monster who would destroy a country for the sake of sweets"".","Mero, Neptune, Nico Robin, Shirahoshi, Franky, Caribou, Monkey D.

Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji find Caribou and the treasure and start to carry it back, searching for a ride back to Ryugu Palace. On their way back they see a crowd by the sweet factory. Luffy shouts out ""Thank you for the sweets, they were delicious!"" not knowing that the combats of the Big Mom Pirates, Pekoms and Tamago were there. Luffy gets interested by Pekoms and Tamago's looks and then realize they are part of Big Mom's crew. Luffy had been thinking Big Mom was ""a good guy"" because she has claimed the Fish-Man Island as her territory however he realizes that she is only doing it in exchange for 10 tons of sweets.
Big Mom in the New World on Whole Cake Island is waiting for the candy from Fish-Man Island. Bobbin comes right after Big Mom eats some of her crewmates. Bobbin tells her that he destroyed an island and it smelled sweet when he did. She then learns that Fish-Man Island will not be giving her candy. She calls Tamago and Pekoms and they dare not answer so Luffy does. Luffy tells her that he ate the rest of the candy and he is willing to give the treasure to her for repayment. Tamago sees the huge amount of treasure they have and thinks it would be a good idea to keep it however, Big Mom refuses and she says that she will go after Luffy in the new world. Luffy claims that he will beat her up in the New World and claim Fish-Man Island as his own territory.","After the banquet ends, the Straw Hats are excited to hear they will be allowed to keep all of the stolen treasure. Franky says it will make them tycoon pirates in no time. When Chopper suggests searching for Caribou along with Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji, Usopp tells him he just learned that Caribou is worth over 200,000,000. On the island, the group finds Caribou, and Zoro is disappointed that Luffy's punch was all that was needed to defeat him. The three of them are excited to see how much treasure spilled out of Caribou's body. They load it into bags and Luffy asks Zoro which way the town was, prompting Sanji to decide to go the other way. Luffy tells them they need a flying fish.
The scene changes to the Candy Factory, where the Minister of the Left is discussing their problem with the monthly candy payment with a figure off-screen. The man, a lion named Pekoms, reminds the minister that the deal was that they would make candy for Big Mom and in return the island would not be destroyed. He then asks if the Minister knew what kind of person Big Mom is, saying anyone who angers her is doomed. The group of people gathered off to one side all think to themselves how cute Pekoms looks when he is threatening. At the same time, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji walk by and notice the crowd. They go over and Luffy says greets everyone there. Luffy mentions that the best part of the banquet was the sweets made at the factory. As the crowd tries to tell Luffy to be quiet, Pekoms asks who they are. He flips through a book and recognizes Luffy and asks him what he meant when he was talking about sweets. Luffy tells him he had just eaten a lot of them at the banquet. This causes Pekoms to become angry toward the Minister of the Left, who tries to tell him there is an explanation as Luffy realizes that the lion can talk. Another figure then tells Pekoms that threatening people left and right will not accomplish anything and that they need to ship the candy out by tomorrow in order to have it arrive in time for the Tea Party in four days. The man, a longleg wearing an eggshell and using a teacup and saucer for a hat, introduces himself as Tamago.
As Tamago stands up, he asks them if they ate the candy that was made at the factory, Zoro thinks he is a compass, and Luffy tells him that they did eat it and would like more. Tamago then explains that the island belongs to one of the Four Emperors, Charlotte Linlin, and the flag on the factory shows the island is under her protection. Luffy concludes from this that she is a good person and says he wants to meet her. Tamago tells him it is strictly business. The island gives her ten tons of candy a month and she gives them her flag, adding that Linlin loves candy more than anything. Tamago explains that the candy from Fish-Man Island is one of his captain's favorites and they can wait until tomorrow to collect the candy. The Minister of the Left explains again that the cooking equipment in the factory was destroyed and they will need two weeks to get everything up and running again, which the baron tells him is unacceptable. Sanji then gets indignant and asks why he cannot just wait. Zoro adds that despite being an emperor, their captain does not have a lot of balls. Tamago clarifies that Big Mom is a woman, and therefore had no balls to begin with. Sanji, while imagining with no degree of accuracy what the woman looks like, asks what would happen if the sweets are late. Tamago replies that the treaty would be dissolved and the Big Mom Pirates would destroy the island. Luffy is furious that someone would destroy an island over candy, especially since he and his crew just saved it.
The scene changes to the New World, to a place called Whole Cake Island where someone remarks that Big Mom seems excited. She replies that she is looking forward to the tea party that takes place in a few days and is looking forward to the candy from Fish-Man Island. She then asks the person if he is excited, to which they say yes. Big Mom then tells him to continue his excitement in her stomach, and promptly eats him. A three-eyed girl sits uncomfortably in a chair as Big Mom chews. A subordinate, Bobbin, comes in, and Big Mom asks him how the operation went. She is happy when Bobbin tells her the whole thing went up in flames, saying the baked sweets from that country were the best and it must have smelled delicious since it was burned to the ground. Bobbin asks if she has any snacks as Big Mom goes on to say that anyone who does not give her sweets must be killed, and that she likes dishonesty as much as she likes bad candy. Bobbin then remembers to tell her that Fish-Man Island might not be able to come up with their payment for the month. The shot changes to show an enormous woman leaning forward in a chair, surprised at what Bobbin just said. Bobbin explains that he just received a call from Pekoms and asks her if they should torch that island as well. Big Mom then orders a call be placed through to the island at once.
As Luffy voices his anger over destroying an entire island for candy, a Den Den Mushi rings. Pekoms realizes it must be their captain, since he just reported the situation. Everyone nearby, including Pekoms and Tamago, are afraid to find out who is making the call. So Luffy answers it. Luffy asks if he is speaking to Big Mom. The voice on the other end is confused, since she does not recognize Luffy's voice as belonging to one of her subordinates. Luffy introduces himself and declares he will be Pirate King. Linlin recognizes his name and remembers he is Garp's grandson as well as his involvement in the war two years ago. Luffy tells her there is no more candy. He then goes on to say that he was the one who ate it all. Charlotte realizes Luffy is trying to cover for the island by placing the blame solely on himself. Luffy tells her he has a bunch of treasure and he will give her all of it in exchange for the candy. Big Mom asks how he expects her to eat treasure.
Tamago then gets an idea and asks Luffy if all of the offered treasure was in the three bags. He then takes the receiver and asks his captain to calm down. He then tells her that two days ago, Kid sank two of their ships. They suffered heavy damages and aren't exactly well off financially. He suggests she take the treasure as collateral and allow the island another two weeks to rebuild and make more candy. Big Mom is furious that Tamago would suggest such a compromise. She then adds that she is now interested in the guy who is taking a stand against her and as he wishes, she will change the target from Fish-Man Island to him. Luffy tells her he has to get even with her adding that it is too dangerous to leave her in charge of the island. Luffy then declares that he will beat her and make Fish-Man Island his territory, much to the irritation of Big Mom.","Nami, Shirahoshi, Usopp, Brook, Franky, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Pappag, Camie, Monkey D.

Episode 572,Grim Prospects - A Trap Awaiting in the New World,11-Nov-12,"The Minister of the Right was thanking the Straw Hats for saving Fish-Man Island, when suddenly he got a report that the Tamate Box is gone and is in the hands of Baron Tamago and Pekoms. The minister of the Right was worried that the Tamate Box will be opened by them because he had put bombs in it since the inside of the box was stolen by Hody 10 years ago. Caribou starts searching for his treasure that he stole from the royal family after realizing it was taken after waking up from getting beat by Luffy. Jinbe and Neptune talk about putting a new pirate flag in Fish-Man Island which is the Straw Hat Pirate flag. The Minister of the Right tells King Neptune that the Tamate Box is gone and it might explode in the hands of Big Mom. Jinbe decides to cut off the alliance with Big Mom before things get ugly.
Caribou finds Tamago and Pekoms with his treasure that he stole and attacks Pekoms with his gatling gun. Pekoms was revealed to be a Devil Fruit user. Caribou then attempts to slice off Pekom's head but he gets punched in the stomach by Pekom's Haki imbued fist which penetrates Caribou's logia defenses. Pekoms and Tamago then leave Fish-Man island.
Smoker and Tashigi are seen with the G-5 Marine Branch and arresting several pirates emerging from Fish-Man Island.","At the palace, the rest of the crew (except Franky) are having tea with the Minister of the Right who states his gratitude towards the crew for saving the island and that they don't need to be so modest about themselves as he's glad to serve them tea. As Usopp states how they are ready to leave the island, Shirahoshi starts crying not wanting them to leave stating she doesn't want to hear that and calls him ""nose-sama"" and Usopp corrects her and tries to apologize. The minister then gets a list of all the treasure and notices that the Tamatebako was stolen and becomes horrified by this information.
Outside the Candy Factory, Caribou has woken up and realizes all the treasure he stole is gone and swears he'll get it back somehow.
While the soldiers fix up the palace, Jinbe and Neptune are talking in Ryugu Palace. Neptune asks how the Sun Pirates are doing under Big Mom's jurisdiction. Jinbe says that she is not the most reasonable boss but they have been free to do what they want. Neptune comments how it must be hard for Jinbe to take orders from someone who wasn't Fisher Tiger. Jinbe replies that he is not picky about who his boss is and that it is a good strategy to serve an Emperor to ensure his crew's safety. Neptune is surprised since he thought Jinbe did it for the sake of Fish-Man Island because thanks to Jinbe, the island was kept safe under Big Mom's name. Jinbe remarks that it is just a coincidence and that he and his crew should be protecting the island, but cannot since they are wanted pirates. Jinbe then announces that he will cut off ties with Big Mom. Neptune concludes that this is because Jinbe wants to join the Straw Hat Pirates. Jinbe says it is and adds that verbal contracts are a lot harder to get out of than written agreements and that there is a chance Big Mom will direct her anger at the island. Neptune tells him he is taking too much responsibility, adding that the army just gained another seventy thousand soldiers from the Fish-Man District and he has found another flag he wants to borrow: the Straw Hats', an idea which Jinbe likes.
The Minister of the Right comes in out of breath, saying he remembered something important about the treasure given to the Straw Hats. They must return the Tamatebako. There is a bomb in it and it is rigged to explode upon opening. The minister did this after it was stolen ten years ago as a safety precaution. Neptune agrees that they will ask them to return it. A guard enters and announces the Straw Hats have returned. Nami, Neptune, and the Minister of the Right are then shocked to hear that Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji gave the treasure to Big Mom. Luffy tells them she was going to destroy the island, that she is crazy, and that he would fight her, horrifying everyone except Shirahoshi who comments on his bravery and cries because Usopp yelled at her and Robin who just giggles. Jinbe realizes that now he must leave Big Mom before things get even worse. He suggests that the Straw Hats must not irritate her more than they have. The Minister of the Right whispers to Neptune that Big Mom might take the bomb as an act of war. Nami then sympathizes with Luffy, saying he stood his ground the way any man would. She then hits Luffy, Zoro and Sanji for giving away all of the treasure. Luffy then declares they should go to the New World. As that happens, the crew prepares themselves and all head towards the ship with Franky on it followed by the royal family.
At the Candy Factory, Caribou says that if he brings back the princess and the treasure, then he could get on a certain person's good side. He then sees a crowd of people by Baron Tamago and Pekoms, who are carrying three large bags. Caribou realizes they must have the treasure. He charges at them, demanding the treasure back. Pekoms recognizes him and looks him up in a book. A Gatling gun extends from Caribou's stomach and he shoots at Pekoms. Pekoms is knocked over but when the dust clears, he is seen hidden inside a tortoise shell. Caribou realizes he must be a Zoan. He flies at Pekoms with a scythe. Pekoms blocks the attack with a single Haki-imbued punch, shattering the scythe and sending Caribou flying. Pekoms afterwards, mentions that the downfall of a Logia is its own pride of invincibility. Pekoms and Tamago then leave while the citizens marvel at Pekoms' strength since he has a bounty of 330 million.
The scene changes to New World, near the Red Line. Marines are fighting multiple coasted pirate ships coming from the sea. Someone shouts that Captain Tashigi is in trouble. Two lovestruck Marines try to embrace her to protect her. She jumps out of the way and toward an incoming cannon ball. Using her sword, she manages to redirect the cannon ball, which blows up away from the ship. The two soldiers cheer, but she tells them to stop messing around. She berates them, not knowing she is yelling at the ship's mast. She asks how they could be joking around right now. She then accuses them of teasing her for being a woman. Smoker tells her to be quiet, since he is in the middle of an interrogation. Smoker turns toward his prisoners, reiterating that pirates were being enslaved by Hody, citing that as the explanation why no rookies came through Fish-Man Island in the last month. But now, they are coming out of the sea practically non-stop. The captured pirates then go on to say that there was a pirate who stopped Hody's war, ultimately freeing them. However, he will not tell Smoker the name. One guy shuts him up, saying that they are dealing with the Marines of G-5, listing rumors of their torture methods. Other Marines ask Smoker if they could have the prisoners now. Panicking, the pirate blurts out that it was Luffy who saved them. Smoker tells them that he already knew that.","Minister of the Right, Shirahoshi, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Brook, Nami, Nico Robin, Caribou, Neptune, Jinbe, Megalo, Surume (flashback, not fully seen), Charlotte Linlin (image, not fully seen), Monkey D.

Episode 573,Finally Setting Sail! Goodbye Fish-Man Island,18-Nov-12,"The mermaids and Camie from the Mermaid Cafe ask Madam Shyarly if they can say good bye to the Straw Hats. Madam Shyarly says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fish-Man Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hody and the New Fish-Man Pirates.
Meanwhile, Shirahoshi is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go. Usopp and Chopper complain that they are going to die in the New World. The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new New World Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World. The Minister of the Left explains about the new Log Pose's features when Luffy suddenly grabs onto Nami, wanting to see the new Log Pose. She complains and says that she will tell the crew where to go but Luffy complains saying that he is the captain so he should decide where they should go. Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and the crew does it.
The Straw Hats finally leave and some of the children of the Fish-Man Island ask their parents if they can get a Straw Hat similar to Luffy's and Jinbe says he will get some. Luffy then remember the times when Shanks, Rayleigh, Jinbe, and Ace told him something important. The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World.","Camie tells Shyarly that Luffy and his crew are going to leave the island. Shyarly tells her to go see them off. Before she leaves, Camie notices the broken crystal ball on the floor. Shyarly tells Camie that she is through with foreseeing the future for good, and she could not be happier if she was wrong. Camie realizes her boss is more fearful than anyone, since her prediction may come in a year or more, and there is no way to know if she is wrong. Shyarly asks Camie to forgive her for suspecting her friends of wrongdoing.
The scene changes and Shirahoshi is crying as she holds Luffy in her hand, asking him to stay for another week, then a month, and then a year. After seeing Shirahoshi, Sanji wishes he could stay for a year. Brook says that he will call his new single ""Life on Fish-Man Island is a Dream"". Zoro tells Sanji he should stay on the island, calling him ""nosebleed-kun"", much to Sanji's anger. Sanji says he will teach him not to cross the person who cooks his food. Over to one side, the Minister of the Right whispers to Neptune about the tamatebako. Neptune tells him to look at the pirates. Usopp and Chopper are in despair, saying they are going to the New World to die. Chopper wonders if Big Mom would forgive them if they gave her all their treasure from here on out. Neptune and the minister realize they could not tell them at this point. Neptune does add that it was ten years since the bomb was placed in there, it may have become a dud. The Minister of the Right says he does have a point, the castle is damp, and Big Mom might not be the one to open the box. Robin wonders what they are whispering about.
The Minister of the Left then gives Nami a new Log Pose, with three needles on it instead of one. Shirahoshi lowers Luffy so he can see the new Log Pose. Nami looks at the one on her wrist. She wonders why it is moving, since she thought it had already recorded the next island. The minister tells her that each island in the New World as well as Fish-Man Island take only half a day to record. The islands can differ in current, climate, and magnetic fields, which until now have been the only thing they could rely on. However, there are also islands that lose their magnetic fields. The minister points out that only one needle on the Log Pose is shaking, while the other two are completely still. Each needle records the waves of a different island, meaning the navigator must choose which way to go, and the wrong decision could mean certain death. Master navigators can choose the safest routes by observing subtle differences in the needles' movements. The stronger the needle's movement the more dangerous the island. Nami finds this new navigation method deeply disturbing. Suddenly, Luffy wraps his neck around Nami and notices the center needle shaking. He decides to go to that island, as it looks like fun. Nami and Usopp are devastated that Luffy overheard the conversation. Nami tries to strangle him, saying she is the one who chooses the route, but Luffy says he is the captain. Usopp and Chopper beg Luffy to see sense.
Franky then declares that they are ready to go and he even learned how to float up. Hatchan tells them he is staying behind to help repair the factory. Usopp and Chopper have become more enthusiastic, saying they are going to war in Hell. Sanji and the mermaids say their goodbyes, and Sanji calls them the All Blue of his heart. Fukaboshi thanks Luffy. Manboshi declares that they will be leading the strongest army in the ocean next they meet, and Ryuboshi says their reputation will be even more renowned. Luffy and Jinbe simply exchange silent looks. As the crew leaves, the people call from the shore that they now like humans, as well as robots, raccoons, and skeletons. Shirahoshi then swims up and grabs the side of the ship, making everyone fall over. She tells him she will not be a crybaby next time they meet and wants to go on another walk with Luffy, only this time she wants to go to the surface and see a real forest with them. She holds out her pinky and Luffy wraps his own around hers, symbolizing the promise. The other Straw Hats, save for Zoro and Franky, all touch their own pinky fingers to hers. She then waves as they leave, splashing water on her face and holding her pinky finger. Neptune tells his son not to forget their debt. A child then asks his father for a straw hat so he could play heroes with it. His father then tells him that they are only available on the surface. Jinbe overhears the conversation and tells them he will send a merchant ship to get the hats.
On the Thousand Sunny, Sanji is reveling in his memories, but Nami tell them there is no time to rest, as they have to go back through the dark sea again. Attached to the foremost mast of the ship is a string of floating blocks. Franky tells Usopp they are called Kuuigosu, and extremely buoyant wood that he is using to raise the ship. Their speed of ascent can be controlled by how many are let out. Luffy is standing on the bow, and Zoro asks him if something is wrong. Luffy says they will be in the same ocean as Shanks when they reach the surface and he is looking forward to seeing him. He then remembers the day Shanks gave him his straw hat. He also remembers the words of encouragement given to him by Ace, Jinbe, and Rayleigh. Finally, he remembers the conversation he had with Koby about the New World. Everyone gets fired up while Robin simply laughs. The episode ends with Luffy shouting they are going to the New World.","Shyarly, Camie, Ishilly, Lulis, Seira, Hiramera, Fillonce, Kairen, Adele, Mero, Sora, Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets, Minister of the Right, Minister of the Left, Neptune, Ryuboshi, Fukaboshi, Manboshi, Ammo Knights, Franky, Shirahoshi, Monkey D.

Episode 574,To the New World! Eyes on the Strongest Sea!,25-Nov-12,"Heading into the New World, the Straw Hats (minus Nami and Chopper) are seen constructing something on deck. Inside, Nami is showering while Chopper asks if they'd be okay without her outside. Assuring him everything would be fine while deterring Sanji and Brook from peeking on her, Luffy, Zoro and Usopp set their eyes on catching a deep sea fish to eat. Knocking out the one Luffy had wanted, Usopp fires a makeshift fishing line into the fish's mouth in order to reel it in. Suddenly a two consecutively larger fish attempt to eat their predecessor on the line with the final fish being killed by Zoro who uses an upgraded technique.
Due to the extra weight of the fish, the Thousand Sunny is drawn into a nearby White Strom, where after being tossed around extensively they are then stuck by something massive and are ejected from the current, discovering a pod of Island Whales to whom Luffy and Brook mistake for as Laboon. Despite realizing they weren't his friend, Brook still chooses to play a song for the whales who then help them to the surface of the New World where they're thrown into a rough sea and come across several Marine warships.","The Straw Hats are heading to the New World. Nami is taking a bath in the Thousand Sunny and Chopper comes in. Nami asks Chopper if he wants to join her in the bath and he says no claiming that he took one two days ago and the cloud reminds him of cotton candy. Sanji and Brook walk by and saw Nami taking a bath so they stare at her. Nami asked Chopper to move aside away from the cloud she made and the cloud electrified Sanji and Brook. Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud.
Meanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out. Luffy tells Usopp to hurry up with the fish hook because he wants to catch and eat a big fish. Robin says that Luffy and Usopp are having fun. Franky says he wants Cola with a big fish. Zoro says he wants to have a drink to celebrate entering the New World. Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp sees three big fish. Zoro wants to eat a fried fish with salt. Usopp wants a fish sliced up and grilled. Luffy wants a fish with mayonnaise. Usopp says which fish Luffy wants and claims that it is not edible. Luffy punches the fish with Gear 2 and Usopp uses the fish hook to grab hold of it. The fish that they caught suddenly got ate by a bigger fish and Zoro uses 360 pound cannon killing it. Nami is still in the bath and she claims that the rest of the crew are making too much of a ruckus and they she shouldn't have trusted them in watching the ship for her.
They suddenly got caught in a White Strom and Luffy claims it is the wormhole of his dreams and Usopp slaps him for saying that. Nami claims the crew to be stupid for getting into too much trouble while she was taking a bath. They get caught in the White Strom and they try to hang out to something so they won't fly out of the ship. They finally crash into a whale without noticing at first. Brook then claims that the whale is Laboon but they finally see a whole bunch of whales and the others claim that Laboon is not here but in the first half of the grand line. Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do. Nami says they don't need to do anything and Sanji listened. The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World. Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface. Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World.
They finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean. The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines.","Franky, Monkey D.

After surviving the night, the Straw Hats began to enjoy a relatively calm but hot day at sea only to find that all their food is mysteriously disappearing from right under their noses. Luffy is determined to catch the thief taking his food.","Surrounded by a fleet of Marine battleships, the Straw Hats prepare to fight the overwhelming odds but Nami points out that they were actually mirages. She informs them that they are in the Maubeugemour Sea where dangerous weather phenomena occur and the Straw Hats are in the middle of it. The Straw Hats managed to counter nearly everything the sea throws at them, from humongous rain drops which quickly turned into hail, from snowfall the size of an avalanche and even the very sea splitting into a gorge. After surviving the vicious sea, the Straw Hats enjoy a peaceful but hot day at sea. Sanji prepared some meals for the crew made from whats left of the giant fish Luffy caught. However, Sanji sees that the food he cooked is gone, so he blames it on Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper. Chopper thought the sea must be haunted until he hears a voice coming from the soup pot which was now empty. Suddenly, the food in the kitchen began to be eaten very quickly, leading to a hunt for whatever is eating their food. Sanji, having a bad feeling check the pantry only to find all their food supply gone. After a brief scuffle on deck, Luffy finds the person who ate the food and it turns out to be a miniature woman. Realizing that there is no escape she prepares to fight back and grew to the size of a giant scaring half of the crew. She attempts to strike Luffy but he blocks her weapon and with his superior strength threw her in the sea where she was rescued by Sanji before she drowned.
Thanking them for saving her even though she ate their food, she introduces herself as Lily Enstomach. She turns out to be a giant, but ate a Devil fruit that forced her to be small. She tells them that she was trying to save her father who was being sent to Impel Down for stealing food from the world Government and secretly heard that the ships escorting her father were going to pass through the Maubeugemour Sea. She explained that her father is Panz Fry, a giant cook in the New World famous for his Volcano cooking and giving the stolen food to starving people. Luffy then decided to help her save her father because he wants to try her father's cooking.
In a different part of the New World, there is a whole fleet of Neo Marine ships gathering, one of which houses Ain and Binz.
On the Neo Marines' ship, Ain calls Shuzo and asks why he was not there with the rest of the fleet. Shuzo tells Ain he is going after Lily's father to kill him so he can replace her as Z's second in command. Back with the Straw Hats, they began to see Marine ships coming their way who have Lily's father captive, so Luffy declares to do battle against the Marines.","Binz, Ain, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Usopp, Franky, Brook, Nico Robin, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Monkey D.

Luffy and Momonga prepare to fight Shuzo.","As Panz Fry is being taken into custody by the Marines, Vice Admiral Momonga questions him for his actions in taking the pirates' food from before, Panz Fry states it was because there are other starving people that need it more and that all of the food that Marines take is used for the World Nobles and states they do not need all of the food and question how could the Marines let others starve for the sake of the cruel World Nobles. Momonga states regardless he is still going to Impel Down for being a pirate.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates have Nami create a plan for the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates to rescue Lily's father. Chopper, Robin, Brook, and Luffy are the diversion group while Usopp, Sanji, Zoro, and Lily are in the submarine. Luffy goes on the submarine because he finds the diversion group boring. As they go to rescue him, Usopp mentions to Lily that they have met giants before such as Dorry and Brogy, surprising Lily that they met them and states that her father have been friends with the two since they were kids. They execute the plan as Robin uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to take out the Marines around the ships while Brook uses his Yomi Yomi no Mi abilities to scare them away.

While they fall, Luffy starts laughing and says that the dragon looks yummy. Zoro then says that they could have a barbecue with the flames on the island as Robin uses her powers to catch the two.
Back at the Thousand Sunny, Sanji finishes making a meal for Nami and calls for her, but finds everybody is asleep with some fog floating around. Sanji, realizing that it is not fog but actually gas, tries to contact Luffy by reaching for the Den Den Mushi, but is put to sleep himself for breathing in too much of the gas beforehand.

The people of Punk Hazard who work for Master see Luffy's group and tell the harpy girl about them.","Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Robin are standing near the dead dragon that Zoro killed and Luffy is trying to pull out the man who is stuck in the dragon's body. Luffy succeeds in pulling out only the legs, making everyone think that he killed the man. The legs are revealed to be alive, making the whole group gawk at it. Robin points out that there is no trace of an upper body while Usopp states that he is quite tall. While the crew remains baffled, the legs start to attack them but promptly run away after the unknown Shichibukai. Luffy is then seen calling to it to join his crew, causing Usopp to hit him on the head and telling him to stop it. Luffy runs after and launches himself at the legs, colliding with it and they both falls.

It is revealed that the pair of legs is now stuck onto Luffy. Before he can do anything else, the legs lift Luffy up and piledrive him into the ground. Usopp tells Luffy that there must be an upper body in trouble somewhere but Luffy questions where is Usopp's sense of adventure before stating that the legs were born like that. He asks what name does the legs go by when it piledrive him again. Zoro calls to the others from atop a building. He points and the crew realizes they are standing right before a lake, beyond which is a mountain range covered in ice. Usopp and Robin realize that the distress call they received came from the cold side of the island. Luffy is excited by this and wants to eat shaved ice. Usopp, while shouting at Zoro (who, along with Robin, wants to explore the island with Luffy), senses something strange on a nearby chimney. He looks over to see a smiling winged woman staring at him, who then flies off like a bird. Usopp tells the others about what he saw but is not sure about it himself.
In a laboratory, a guard walks in to inform the master of having kidnapped Sanji, Nami, Franky and Chopper and the master is very pleased, especially over Franky's cyborg body and chooses to experiment on them later as he tells his men to lock them in a room. Back on the Sunny, Brook, having been left behind due to them believing he was already dead, wakes up while some guards are still on the ship. He questions if the guards know the whereabouts of Nami and the rest but the guards are too shock and shoot at him.
Later, Franky wakes up to the sound of Sanji kicking the wall and asks what is wrong. Nami tells him it should be obvious and Chopper tells him they are locked up. Franky tries to remember the last thing he did, and Nami assumes that whoever took them must have hit them with sleeping gas, which is confirmed by Sanji. Franky then wonders where Brook is, Nami replies that she doesn't know. Chopper says that if humans are being abducted, then skeletons are not needed. Franky tells Chopper that he isn't human either and Sanji retorts that neither is Franky. From one corner, a voice asks them if they like riddles. The group looks around for the source of the voice, and Chopper jumps back in shock. The voice is from a mouth that is one of eight pieces of a disassembled man's head. The man asks if they could piece him back together. Each member gives it a shot, and they finally get pretty close, having only mixed up the hair and chin, but he admits his gratitude regardless. Chopper asks him why he is alive, and the head says he does not know as he thought himself to be dead when he was cut up by someone and claims he feels shameful for what happened.
Back at Luffy's group, everyone except Usopp plan to go to the cold side and wonders how do they go about crossing the lake. Usopp is pessimistic about surviving till then and wonder how can Luffy stays in high spirits. Luffy is attacked from behind but he manages to dodge. The attacker is a centaur with leopard legs and they instantly become friends after realizing what they have in common. He apologies to Luffy for mistaking him as an intruder.

Episode 582,Shock! The Secret of the Island is Finally Revealed,27-Jan-13,"Franky, Sanji, Nami and Chopper are surprised that the samurai is still alive after being cut. He is surprised that Nami talks in such a direct manner and dresses in revealing outfits but says that he likes it. He then finds out that they are pirates and says that he doesn't want to go with them because he hates pirates. He says that the reason he went to the island was to find his son. Franky then blasts a hole in the wall using his Radical Beam and they escape, running into a room filled with giant children.
Luffy races against the centaur he befriended. Usopp contacts Brook and he tells him that Nami, Sanji, Franky, and Chopper were captured. The centaur gets a call from his comrade who tells him that Luffy is the enemy. Luffy beats him up and Robin handles the other centaur that comes to help. The Straw Hats notice that the Den Den Mushi the centaurs were using had CC written on it.
The Master gets news that the Straw Hats escaped and that one of them can shoot laser beams like the Pacifistas. He also learns that they are in the biscuits room with the giant kids. He also finds out that the Marines are arriving and tells his men to send out poison gas to stop them from landing. The G-5 men start suffocating from the gas so they put on gas masks. Smoker then explains that the island was the battleground for Aokiji and Akainu when they fought for for the title of Fleet Admiral two years ago.","As Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Franky look over the head as Nami notices how his head is similar to Buggy, which she attributed to as being weird. She asks if he knows where they are. The head becomes indignant, saying that Nami should behave like a proper lady. Nami picks him up by the cheek, saying he should be nicer to the people who put him back together. The head says he will sympathize with her, seeing as she has been stripped of all she had. Nami tells him that she has not been stripped and is wearing fashionable clothing. The head is shocked that something so revealing would be so mundane. Even still, he tells Nami he likes it, and receives a beating from her and a kick into the wall from Sanji.
The head asks who the Straw Hats are, having heard they were taken from their ship. After hearing they are pirates, his attitude changes, as he cannot stand pirates. He mentions that the land is frozen, which confuses the crew. Nami explains that it is possible since she saw winter clouds from the ship, and so it must be half ice and half fire. She says they need to leave, and she and Sanji jump out of the way as Franky blasts a hole in the wall with his Radical Beam, blowing away the door. Sanji tells the head he should escape with them, but the man stubbornly tells them to leave refusing there help. Sanji then fixes his hair and chin properly, and revealing that he discovered that the man is a samurai from the Wano Country. Just then they hear voices and realize they need to hurry. Sanji tells him about the call from the guy who was cut by samurai. The head says he would not pointlessly kill. He came to the island to save his son. The crew runs, taking the head with them as Sanji says he'll take the head with them and take responsibility. Sanji kicks through a door and they find themselves in a room full of gigantic children.
On the burning side of Punk Hazard, Luffy is having fun with his centaur friend and they race as Robin, Zoro and Usopp converse with Brook on the Den Den Mushi they found. He was still on the ship, which was brought around to the cold side of the island. Brook tells them that he was knocked out but remembers they were wearing gas masks. Robin then deduces that the ship was hit with sleeping gas. Robin asks Brook if he sees a building anywhere. Brook sees a large building built into a mountain. Usopp tells Brook they will hurry over and he should wait for them. Zoro asks if their enemy is from the government. Usopp tells him he would be surprised if their enemy is even human, since all they have seen are a dragon, a bird woman, and now a centaur that Luffy is getting chummy with. Luffy then knocks out the centaur with a kick to the head after the centaur realized Luffy was the intruder. As the centaur goes down, he said he was careless to think Luffy was one of them. Luffy asks why he cannot be, since they had just become friends. Another centaur tries to attack Luffy from behind, but Robin stops it with Cien Fleur Rindo. The group finds it odd that the centaurs' lower halves are those of a leopard and a giraffe, since they are supposed to be horses. Usopp finds a Den Den Mushi on one of the and notices it has CC written on it. He realizes they must be part of an organization. He then adds that they really have to go through the ice lands to rescue the others. Robin hopes aloud that they weren't shot full of holes when they were captured. Zoro remarks that they should have gone ashore from the other side. Luffy argues if they did that they would not have been able to eat a dragon or meet Leggy, which is the name he gave the disembodied legs. Robin wonders if they sell winter clothes along the way to the icy part of the island.
Meanwhile, more guards are investigating the room where the Straw Hats here kept. A floating liquid mass is amazed that the crew was able to destroy a door that was supposed to be indestructible. He goes on to say that no one but Vegapunk should have the technology to build a laser, but the burn marks make it look like a Pacifista blew the door away. The mass asks if they found the escapees yet, and a soldier responds that they should be getting cornered in the Biscuits Room right now. Another soldier comes and tells the liquid mass that a G-5 ship has appeared on the coast. The liquid tells the soldier to get rid of it without killing anyone, as a bunch of dead Marines would be too much of a hassle.
On the northwest shore of the island, the G-5 ship is having trouble advancing, as gas is leaking out. Due to a failed chemical weapons experiment by Vegapunk four years ago, the island became a wasteland. Tashigi comments that no one should be able to set foot on the island since there is so much gas. Smoker corrects her, saying that this much gas is unnatural. Two years ago, the island was a normal wasteland without any fire or ice. At that time, most of the poisonous materials had vanished. It was because of that that Aokiji and Akainu chose Punk Hazard as the spot for their battle to determine who would become fleet admiral. The island was host to a battle so intense, it changed the weather.","Samurai, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Franky, Nami, Doran (silhouette), Sind, Mocha, Konbu, Pandaman (doll), Monkey D.

The hazmat suit soldiers arrive and attempt to capture Nami's group, and the pirates run away. Meanwhile, Usopp makes a banana boat so Luffy's group can get across from the fire side of Punk Hazard to the snow side of the island. The centaur, whom Luffy beat earlier, sees them and tells his boss that the Straw Hat Pirates are heading to the snow part of Punk Hazard.
Back to the mysterious facility, Nami's group decide to stay and save the children, and defeat the hazmat suit soldiers. Meanwhile, on the frozen side of the island, Brook is building snowmen and is suddenly attacked by the samurai's torso just after his snowmen are complete.","In the Ice Lands, inside the mysterious facility, Sanji's group stares in awe as they look at the children in front of them, while the children look like they are scared of the Straw Hats. Sanji asks who the children are, and Nami wonders if this is the island's day care. Franky mentions their size and compares them to giants, but Nami points out that some of the children aren't as big as the others. Sanji then points out that it may be a multi-racial nursery, and Nami notices that no adults are around. a child then asks who they are, and a little girl says that she doesn't know any of them. The little girl then asks them if they are the ones who got frozen, but Nami and Sanji question what she means. The children then notice Franky's body, and begin to stare in awe. The children then start to run towards Franky, and knock Sanji over in the process. Nami tries to ask the kids about the frozen people, but then the children notice Chopper, and begin to play with him. Sanji remarks how popular Franky is with boys, and then a little boy walks up to him and calls him ""spiral eyebrows"". Sanji then tells the child to shut up, but more kids appear and begin to call him ""spiral eyebrows"". Franky then starts to show off, by showing the kids his various hairstyles and what he can do with his body. The kids start to imitate Franky, which annoys Nami because she wants to find out information.
Suddenly, the samurai yells out to the kids and asks them if they know a child named Momonosuke, and states that he is a boy. The sight of the samurai's detached head scares the children, and they run away. Sanji and Nami tell him to shut up, because if he keeps it up, they will never be able to get information out of him.
Suddenly, the men in hazmat suits arrive in the Biscuits Room. Franky notices them approaching, and tells the others that it is time to run. Sanji continues to question the children, and the samurai continues to ask them if they know his son. Nami tells the samurai to keep his mouth shut and smacks him, because he is scaring the children, and by doing that, no information can be gotten from them. The samurai states that being hit by a woman is dishonorable to a samurai, and that he should just commit ritual suicide. Nami then tells him to go ahead and do it. The men in hazmat suits prepare to fire at the Straw Hats, but stop themselves when they realize that they will hit the children, which will make their master angry.
In the Burning Lands, Luffy's group has arrived at the lake. Usopp asks Luffy if he really wants to cross the lake, and Luffy says yes. Zoro suggests they swim across, which causes Luffy to say that he is a devil fruit user, and Robin imagines Usopp and Zoro carrying them across the lake on their backs. Usopp says there's no way he's going to do it, and that Zoro wouldn't either, but when he looks at Zoro, he sees him stretching in preparation for the task. Usopp realizes that if they don't cross here, they will have to go all the way around, so he uses his ""Special Attack - Green Star"" ability to grow fan grass. He then shoots out a Boaty Banana, and Luffy jumps in it. Usopp explains that the fan grass can be used as an oar. Robin then compliments Usopp's new techniques, and he explains his hardships on the Boin Archipelago, where he was able to learn the new techniques. Usopp starts gloating about his courage on the islands, but is interrupted by Luffy, who tells him to hurry up. The Straw Hats then begin to row the boat through the harsh wind on the lake. Robin explains that the harsh winds are due to the major temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the island. Suddenly, the leopard centaur from before returns, and throws a boulder at the Boaty Banana. Luffy then asks the centaur if he changed his mind, and if he wants to join their crew now. Zoro and Usopp then tell Luffy to stop trying to recruit weirdos. The centaur then pulls out a horn, and blows it. He calls out to his Boss, which makes Usopp remember the conversation with the man on the Den Den Mushi. The centaur then tells his boss to finish off the intruders. Suddenly, a large pack of centaurs appear on the other side of the lake, and the largest one states that he sees a man with swords on the other side, and comes to the conclusion that the man is the samurai who cut his men down.
Back in the Biscuits Room, Sanji's group continues to run from the men in hazmat suits. The hazmat suit men tell the kids to move out of the way, and the blonde haired little boy from before asks Franky if he is from another island. Franky tells him yes, and then the boy asks them if they have a ship, and Franky also says yes to that. The boy then tells him to help them, which surprises the Straw Hats. Sanji wonders what he means by that, and Chopper comes to the conclusion that it is not actually a daycare. The little girl from before then confronts Nami, and begs her to save them, which causes Nami to stop. Nami contemplates helping the kids, but Sanji tells her to hurry up, which causes her to keep running. The kids then state that they aren't sick anymore, and just want to go home, which causes Chopper to wonder what kind of sickness they may have. The men in hazmat suits then walk up behind the kids, and call them brats.
The kids stare in sadness at the departing Straw Hats, and the hazmat suit men confront the children. The men tell the children that the Straw Hats are bad people, and that they should stay away from them. The kids state that the Straw Hats didn't seem like bad people, but the hazmat suit men then say that the Straw Hats tricked them. The kids then ask if each one of the Straw Hats are villains, and the hazmat suit men say they are, and say that they will protect the children from the villains. They then state that they are going to put the Straw Hats to sleep with their gas. The little girl from before then screams out to the Straw Hats, and tells them that she just wants to go home. All of the children then tell the pirates to wait, and the hazmat suit men once again call them brats. The little boy and girl beg Nami to help them, and the hazmat suit men ask the kids to stop running. Nami tells the two that she has to run, but the kids continue to follow them. Chopper then says that they should take the kids with them, but Franky says that they don't even know how to save themselves, and that they can't take as many kids, which causes Franky to go into one of his depressed states. The kids then stop running, and are out of breath. The black haired little girl then screams out to the Straw Hats and asks them to come back later and help them, and says that she knows that there is nobody else on the island that can save them, due to it being uninhabited. She then states that she just wants to see her father and mother again, and continues to beg Nami to come back later for them. A baby begins to cry, and the hazmat suit men continue to approach, and Sanji tells Nami to keep running. Nami then remembers the happiness the kids showed earlier, and contrasts it to their crying now. Nami then turns around, and says that they should help the children. Sanji turns around and says that they can't be sure that the kids actually need saving, and that the men in hazmat suits could be right about them being sick. Sanji states that it is not their job to help every single person, but Nami says that you just can't turn your back on a child crying for help. The hazmat suit men then decide that the best thing to do is to just gas the kids as well, and right as they prepare to shoot, Sanji bursts out from behind and uses Diable Jambe Collier Strike on the man who was about to gas them. The samurai exclaims that Sanji is really strong, and the kids call him really cool. Chopper then joins in on the fight, and uses Kung Fu Point to fight off the hazmat suit men. Franky also joins in, and uses Strong Right to take out a hazmat suit guy. As the Straw Hats fight, the kids exclaim how cool their abilities are. The hazmat suit men are surprised that the Straw Hats stopped running, and Sanji states that he likes Nami's attachment to children, and states that he is falling for her even more. Sanji tells Chopper to go ahead with Nami, and also tells the kids to follow Chopper and Nami, and that he and Franky will fight off the hazmat suit men. He then tells them not to misunderstand his actions, and that he is only doing it for Nami, and that he hates them because of how much she cares for them. The kids thank Sanji, and then go with Nami and Chopper. Sanji and Franky then tell the hazmat suit guys to bring it on.
Outside of the facility, Brook builds a snowman. He wonders how long it will take for Luffy's group to reach him, and finishes his last snowman. Suddenly, someone holding a fire-like sword starts cutting down Brook's snowmen, and Brook goes on the defense and clashes with the swordsman. Brook then notices that the swordsman is just a torso.","Nami, Sanji, Samurai, Franky, Tony Tony Chopper, Mocha, Sind, Konbu, Doran, Uzu, Ally, Monkey D.

Episode 584,A Duel of Swordplay - Brook vs. the Mysterious Samurai Torso,10-Feb-13,"At the lake, Luffy's group have been attacked by Brownbeard and his centaur unit who's job was to intercept and eliminate any obvious intruders.
In the lab, Chopper is fighting off the hazmat soldiers who were attempting to get into his, Nami's and the children's way. Sanji and Franky continue to fight off their hazmat soldiers and discovers that they look like sheep. Meanwhile outside of the lab, Brook is seen fighting against the sword wielding torso and after trying to talk to it, gives up and runs away from it.
With the G-5 marines and Smoker, the group blasts their way into the island and discovers a hidden river which they quickly enters, unaware that the river was being monitored. At the Lab, a hazmat soldier warns ""Master"" that the marines have almost reached the harbor. Master says he doesn't want to reveal himself to them, but his accomplice says he will greet them instead. The G-5 Marines finally reaches the shore and after Smoker rings the doorbell the marines decides to blow the door open. This was interrupted when the door suddenly opens and out comes the former supernova, Trafalgar Law. His sudden appearance makes all the marines except for Smoker and Tashigi scared. Tashigi claims he is now part of the Shichibukai after Law gave the World Government 100 pirate hearts in exchange for the position. Smoker then demands to know why Law is on the island at all since no one is permitted to set foot on the island, to which Law calmly replies with that Smoker and the marines are not allowed to enter here either. ","The G-5 ship is slowly advancing and the crews are all wearing gas masks to protect themselves from the poison gas. Smoker then spots something and Tashigi commands the people manning cannon to fire at the direction he pointed out. The ice shatters and crumbles away in the aftermath of the firing only to reveal a river. The crews are amazed and four of them question how he noticed it in an overly casual manner, causing Smoker to punch them and answers that the sea currents are a giveaway and that they have to pay more attention, as well as checking on their own behavior. Tashigi comments that it is strange and Smoker agrees, saying that the important point is not about the river existing, but rather, the concealing of the river, which leads to the question if the ice that blocked the river mouth was natural or man-made. A wall of ice looms and the marines begin to shoot at it because if they collide, the warship would sink.
Luffy notes that the group at the other side consists of centaurs and wonders if they will join his crew if he asks. Robin says that they must be colleagues of the man whose distress signal they picked up, to which Usopp agrees. Wanting to clear the air, Usopp shouts to the other group that they are here to help and requests to talk to them. However, Brownbeard, an alligator centaur, replies that Usopp is lying through his teeth because of the samurai in his boat and therefore, they are intruders. Usopp realizes that Brownbeard is talking about Zoro and tries to explain. However, he annoys Zoro so they start quarreling. A centaur comments that they are having a falling out and Brownbeard thinking that it is some kind of ploy, says that it is pathetic and gives the command, causing one of the centaur to shoot at the boat.
Chopper encourages the children to run and Nami notes that he is really fired up. Chopper explains that he was entrusted with this important mission by Sanji so he will definitely see it through. Hazmat soldiers appear but Chopper knocks them all out. Nami wonders where should they go and Chopper replies that she has to figure it out by herself. As one of the children worries, Nami assures her, saying that they have made it through plenty of similar situations so she should just relax and follow their lead. The child then smiles and they set of running again.
Inside the Biscuit Room, Franky attacks the hazmat soldiers with Weapons Left. A soldier observes that he has weapons all over his body and another deduces that Franky is the one who broke down the door. The soldiers prepare to load the gas canisters since the children are now gone. However, before they can fire it, Sanji kicks of their masks and invites them to inhale the poison gas along with them. Without gas mask and having their air tanks damaged, a sheep-like soldier shouts at the rest to not use the gas. Sanji in turn stares at him in amazement due to his unnatural appearance. After being detached, the head still seem to know of the movements of his torso. The severed head starts talking about the events that his torso is experiencing, confusing Franky, who does not know who he is referring to. 
Brook is defending himself from the sword attacks of the torso, questioning its identity and the whereabouts of the rest of his body. However, the torso remains silent, which scares Brook.
The marines works hard at breaking the ice apart to prevent collision. Smoker comments that they are going to reach the end soon and others wonder what is in store for them next.
Brook questions if the torso is a ghost and that if he is, he should not come out during the day. He says that he did not do anything wrong and invites the torso to build snowmen and make ice sculptures with him. However, the torso stabs his sword into Brook's hair. Brook hides behind a mound of ice and is dumbfounded by how the torso can attack with such precision as it does not even have eyes, before realizing that he himself is without them as well. The torso launches a series of attacks to which Brook defends. Brook attacks with Aubade Coup Droit but the torso evades it and unsheathes another sword. Brook sees that it uses Two Sword Style and starts running away from it, screaming that it is scary.
A soldier appears at a laboratory and greets his Master, reporting that the G-5 ship is approaching as the poison gas did not work and currently, they are breaking through the ice with a cannon, forcing their way into the island. At this rate, he states that they will arrive at the laboratory soon. ""Master"" ponders the reason behind the marines wanting to reach the island so badly and asks who the person in charge is. After knowing that it is Smoker, the Master comments that he is a pain in the neck. He orders the soldier to conceal all of the ships that are moored at the front and to avoid detection at all cost since no one is allowed on the island. On the topic of who is going to deal with the marines, a person standing at the door, hidden in the shadows, volunteers to personally do so.
The G-5 ship docks and Smoker throws his gas mask away. After a while, Tashigi follows and realizes that the air is indeed clean. The rest of the crew confirms this for themselves and asks about the existence of the gas earlier. Smoker replies that it probably is released by someone who does not welcome their arrival. Walking up to Dr. Vegapunk's former laboratory, Smoker comments that is should be abandoned and empty. Testing out the doorbell, it still rings, which leads to the crew questioning who is currently living there. The marines start knocking and kicking the door, shouting for the inhabitant to open up. Before the cannon can be used, the door opens and someone walks out, greeting Smoker and asking him what brought him to his vacation home. Tashigi introduces him to everyone, stating that he is Law, now one of the Shichibukai. His name is proven to be well known as the crew are scared stiff, retreating far away from him and recalling the day where Law delivered a hundred pirates' heart to the headquarters to gain his current status.
Smoker then asks Trafalgar why he is here as no one is allowed to be on the island, to which he calmly replies that then the marines should not be here either.","Smoker, Tashigi, Monkey D.

Smoker and Tashigi claim that the signal from earlier came from Punk Hazard and Trafalgar Law states that the Marines often tend to forge messages. The Straw Hat Pirates and the children see Law and the Marines, at the sight of them they run back into the building. Law uses Room and Tact to lift a marine warship in order to prevent the marines' escape. Smoker and Law then prepare to fight.","Chopper and Nami are trying to escape with the children until they come across a door and Chopper breaks it open. They step inside a cold room with frozen people. Sanji and Franky already beat up all the hazmat suit guys and Sanji wants to kill the samurai because he is annoying. The samurai taunts Sanji because of his merciful behavior. Franky then separates them saying that the samurai is just a helpless head. They then try to catch up with the children with Nami and Chopper.
Brownbeard and the centaurs attempt to kill Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin but Zoro cuts the cannonballs they shot at them. Luffy deflects the rest of the cannonballs. Brownbeard tells the centaurs to aim for the water to sink them. The Straw Hats then paddled their way to safety to avoid being sunk.
Brook keeps on running away from the samurai's torso and sees that the samurai's torso got caught in a big snowball and is rolling down the towards the lake. Brook then claims he didn't see anything.
Smoker and Tashigi play a transmission from earlier, and it says that a centaur got killed by the samurai and he is at Punk Hazard, and also says what Luffy had said to them. Law claims that the message didn't come from there and the marines tend to forge messages and transmissions to catch pirates and wanted people.
Sanji, Nami, Franky, Chopper and the children arrive outside and see Law, Smoker, Tashigi and G-5. Franky comes with tank treads on his shins. Sanji then notices Smoker and ""Cutie"" (Tashigi) and orders them to run away. Chopper and Nami think that Law was behind the children's imprisonment. Tashigi orders G-5 to go after the Straw Hats. Law claims he won't allow the marines to escape so he lifts the marines' ship with Room and Tact.

Episode 586,A Big Pinch - Luffy Sinks into the Cold Lake,3-Mar-13,"Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin try to get to the ice side of Punk Hazard but their ship gets capsized by Brownbeard. As Brownbeard's troop prepares attack them again, Zoro gets ready to destroy their bullets but gets dragged down by sharks. At the last second, Brook saves them and defeats Brownbeard's shooters. Once Luffy and the gang got out of the freezing water after killing the sharks, they opted to take the centaur's warm coats.
The Straw Hats who rescued the children attempt to go back into the building to find another escape route, but their ""hearts"" get switched by Law, making them swap bodies. Law then returns his attention to the marines and destroys their ship. The G-5 marines attempt to contact marine headquarters about Law but he takes away all their Den Den Mushi. Smoker then fights Law and warns his men to stay back from the fight unless they want to get cut to pieces (which they did). Feeling useless in the situation, Tashigi attempts to strike the Shichibukai but was promptly bisected.","The centaurs are still shooting, aiming for the bottom of the boat to sink the Straw Hats. Brownbeard smugly tells them that they will not escape from him, only for Luffy to ask him who he is. Brownbeard is shocked and introduces himself. However, the group replies that they have never heard of him. This caused Brownbeard to be depressed and angered. He fires at them personally and manages to capsize the boat. After falling into the water, Zoro and Usopp carry Luffy and Robin respectively. Teeth chattering, Usopp complains about the temperature of the water. The centaurs prepare to fire the finishing blow and Zoro hands Luffy over to Usopp, saying that he is going to slice them up. Before he can unsheathe his sword, he is dragged into the water, his hands flailing above. Usopp panics and looks on in confusion before dunking his head into the water, discovering that there are sharks swimming around them. He questions why there are sharks in a lake and Brownbeard explains that due to the fight between the two Admirals, a crater is left behind. Seawater seeps in through the cracks, as did various sea creatures, which created the lake.
The Straw Hats are trapped and the centaurs fires. However, the guns exploded and they fall. The interference is revealed to be caused by Brook, who froze the gun barrels belonging to the centaurs. Brook attacks the centaurs and Brownbeard comments that he didn’t know that there is another crew member. He says that it doesn’t matter, since four of them have already become food for the sharks and asks Brook to take a look for himself. However, Brownbeard saw that the sharks are defeated. Instead, the four Straw Hats are on top of an iceberg, shivering from the cold. Robin says that they are lucky to run into the centaurs and they each pick their targets, wanting to steal their warm clothes. Brownbeard recalls that Luffy is actually Ace’s brother, and has a 400 million bounty, scaring the rest of the centaurs and they run. Robin and Luffy use their power to catch their target and Zoro fights a group of them. Brook comments that they are in better shape than he thought.
In front of the laboratory, Trafalgar Law says that he cannot let the Straw Hats escape and uses his powers to switch the four Straw Hats around. Their minds along with their voice are swapped into another body, causing a lot of confusion. Law slices up the warship and an iceberg. He joins the pieces together to form a tall wall, preventing the marines from leaving. The marines tell Law that he is breaking the contract between him and the government and that they are going to report the matter to the headquarters. However, Law calmly tells them not to worry about him, before using his skill, Scan. A pile of Den Den Mushi appears beside him, which is revealed to belong to the marines. Law informs them that he will not allow them to report anything about the island up to the government.
Smoker rushes towards Law and attacks but he evades. Law retaliates but due to the nature of Smoker’s ability, he cuts through the smoke. Smoker warns his crew to stay out of the reach of Law’s sword but it is too late as they are sliced apart. Smoker instructs them to stay out of the circle created by Law and explains his power, comparing the sphere to an operating room. He further elaborates by stating that Law has absolute control over the items contained inside and can manipulate it according to his will, giving him his name, the Surgeon of Death. Tashigi rushes towards Law despite Smoker’s warning about her Haki being not strong enough. True to his words, Tashigi’s sword breaks and she is cut into two.","Brownbeard, Usopp, Monkey D.

Nami, Sanji, Franky, Chopper, the children and the samurai head try to escape from Law and the Marines while figuring out what Law did to them. In front of the laboratory, Law defeated Smoker by taking his heart.","Tashigi was sliced in half in the last episode. Feeling dishonored by still being alive, she tells Law to kill her. He says that she doesn't have the right to tell him when or how she can die and she tries to attack him with her broken sword. She misses and Law prepares to slice her into more pieces. Luckily, Smoker steps in and takes on a fight with Law. Back at Luffy's group, the beaten centaurs talk about how they underestimated the Straw Hats and how they took Brownbeard with them. While they contemplate on that, Luffy, Zoro, Brook, Robin, and Usopp ride Brownbeard to the mysterious building that Brook saw. In the lab, a hazmat guy tells the mysterious air man that Law and Smoker were in a fight and that the children escaped with Nami's group and that Smoker saw the children.
The smoke man became very angry but knew that if he tried to kill Smoker, the Marines would think that something was up. Just then, the Harpy that Usopp saw, Monet, informs the smoke man that the pirates they captured were the Straw Hats and that Luffy's group beat Vegapunk's dragon and the centaurs and were on their way to the facility. The smoke man finally decides to kill the Straw Hats and the G-5. Although the hazmat guy warns him that the Marines would be on the alert, the smoke mans says they would just have to suppress things on the island from now on. He then tells Monet to call a man called Joker. Back with Sanji's group, the children begin to realize that Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Franky switched bodies. They also start to get cold. Sanji states that he doesn't care about anyone anymore and asks if someone has a camera so he can take a picture of himself in Nami's body. When a child falls and complains that it's cold, Franky begins to say that it was a bad idea to bring the children if they didn't have a plan.
Back at the main entrance to the facility, Smoker and Law are still fighting as the G-5 are watching and putting themselves back together outside Law's bubble. As the fighting continues, the G-5 try to figure out why Law was fighting them even though he was a Shichibukai. Tashigi tries to fight and the G-5 stop her. She then reflects on what Smoker told her two years ago: ""Pirates will be pirates."" Closing in on the fight, Smoker and Law fight so viciously, that Law's recoils cut up everything in the way. Smoker then begins to ask him why he was on the island, with Law saying nothing. Back to Tashigi, she begins to remember what Smoker said after the incident at Enies lobby. She remembers him saying that they have to be promoted and that he would kick the asses of the Straw Hats in the New World.
In the fight, Smoker tells Law that he never trusted the Shichibukai and as Smoker charges at him, Law says under his breath, ""Maybe that's the right thing to do,"" and begins to make stone spikes rise from the ground in Smoker's direction to get him. Although Smoker was able to dodge most of them, Law rises one from under him and Smoker gets jabbed. As he drops his jitte, Smoker once again asks why Law was on the island and the two begin to fight again. Law finally answers the question by asking why the G-5 were here. Law pushes Smoker back and Smoker tries to jab Law but instead breaks through a stone spike that Law rose from the ground. As he ducks from the attack, Law tell Smoker that from his current standing he couldn't see a few things and poked out his heart. Law takes the heart and his sword and says that he doesn't have to say anything to Smoker. With his heart outside of his body, Smoker collapses.","Tashigi, Trafalgar Law, Smoker, Brownbeard, Monkey D.

Law remembers the past between him and Luffy when Law saved him at Marineford. Luffy sees Smoker on the ground. Tashigi cries over Smoker's body and attempts to kill Law but he switches their hearts.
Meanwhile, the children from the lab complain about the cold so the samurai uses his devil fruit to give the children and the Straw Hats warm clothes. Luffy's group then meets up with the other group behind the lab.  While going over what happened Robin reveals that Law became a Shichibukai two years ago and the samurai reveals that Law is the one who cut him in thirds and reunites with his legs.

Luffy, Robin, Zoro and Usopp are riding on Brownbeard’s back when they spot the warship, speculating that the Marines are around. Luffy calls out to someone Usopp saw in the distance, asking him if he remembers him and gives him his thanks. Zoro recalls meeting him while they were at Sabaody Archipelago and Robin identifies him as Trafalgar Law but before she can complete her sentence, Luffy interrupts and tells his crew that Law helped him escape from the battlefield and treated his wounds, saving his life. Luffy runs towards Law eagerly and thank him again, wondering where his crew mates are. Law recalls the events from two years ago and tells Luffy that he does not need to thank him and reminds him not to forget that they are both pirates. Luffy laughs and agrees that when it comes to fighting for One Piece, they are all enemies. Usopp sees a Marine soldier on the ground and seems to know who he is. The Marines run towards Smoker and Luffy seems to remember Tashigi. Tashigi reaches Smoker and notices the hole in his chest. She recalls the method Law used to gain his status and cries, shouting angrily while running towards Law. However, Law says that he doesn’t like “lame tear-jerking scenes” and uses his powers to switch the hearts between Tashigi and Smoker. Usopp urges Luffy to leave because the marines are approaching. Before leaving, Luffy tells Law that he wants to ask him something. Law’s reply is for them to go to the back of the laboratory, saying that what they are looking for can be found there and they will see each other again, as they both have something they want to retrieve. However, it is revealed that the instructions are meant for Brownbeard. 
Out in the open air, at a mountain near the laboratory, the children are freezing. The samurai instructs everyone to put something on their heads. When it is done, he concentrates and shouts. Smoke surrounds them and coats magically appear on them. Everyone is amazed and the samurai explains that after eating an unusual fruit, he is able to disguise anyone in any way he sees fit. He warns them that the clothes will disappear if they are taken off. The children swarm towards him gratefully. However, Franky questions the lateness of his actions and smacks him, leading him to explain that he enjoyed the sight of seeing Nami in a breast-band, which earned him another smack from Nami herself.
Luffy’s group appear in the distance and they reunites. They seek shelter inside a building. The samurai is elated at getting his legs back while Luffy is depressed at his loss. Nami offers Sanji some cigarettes and the Straw Hats affected by Law reintroduce themselves to Luffy. They recount all the events that have happened, gaining more information from the samurai and the children to piece everything together. Luffy is surprised that Law is a Shichibukai now, something which Robin knew. When Luffy mentions that the samurai’s legs were cursing about a Shichibukai, Nami questions how can it speak. The samurai explains that he spoke through his farts and it is a specialty of his.
In another cave, the Marines crowd around Tashigi, who is in Smoker’s body, which is functioning even without his heart. Smoker mentions that a ship hidden beside the laboratory has ‘CC’ mark on it. He further explains that if it was an old ship, the initials on it should have been ‘PH’, which would stands for Punk Hazard. Smoker reveals that the person, to whom the initials ""CC"" refer to, is a former colleague of Dr. Vegapunk, a scientist by the name of Caesar Clown.

Episode 589,Worst of the World - The Scary Scientist Caesar,31-Mar-13,"The G-5 Marines discussed if Caesar Clown was probably behind the unusual events at the island and that the child abduction cases in that area may have been real. Caesar was dealing with a patient that he said needed to be healed but he sent the patient to the gas chambers.
Brownbeard was tied up and told Luffy and his crew about the worst generation of the rookies and Blackbeard and that Caesar and Law saved him and his men from dying from the poisonous gas and how Caesar and Law gave them the ability to walk again.
Smoker told his men that Caesar was behind the failed experiment and not Vegapunk. Caesar killed his patient with poisonous gas and planned on being the best scientist the world has ever known and to surpass Vegapunk himself.","Tashigi tells Smoker that if her memory did not fail her, she remembers that recently, there had been numerous occurrence of child abduction. However, Smoker is surprised as he did not know of such matters. Tashigi explains that when such cases are reported, they are published as “accident at sea” or the “work of pirates”. She trails off, not completing her sentence. Smoker questions if she is having difficulties saying it and asks her to speak her mind. Smoker voices out, reaching the conclusion that someone in the G-5 unit helped to cover up the abduction cases. As the Marines fully understand the implication behind the words, they protested loudly, declaring their loyalties to the Marines. Smoker shouts at them and comments that they're not even worth suspecting.  He advises them to lower their expectations of the Marines as no organization is perfect. Smoker commands one third of the Marines to leave the island by stealing a ship to report the incident, while he stays behind to recover his heart and body that is swapped by Trafalgar Law.
Caesar Clown hangs up, saying that he has gotten permission to kill as Joker will make it seem as though it is just another accident at sea. Caesar gives the order to capture the intruders, wanting them to be his guinea pigs. Monet informs Caesar about the Straw Hat Pirates' bounties and her analysis of them. An injured centaur comes in, reporting that he was robbed by the pirates and Brownbeard was captured. Caesar reassures him that he will definitely help everyone and asks him to go and get treatment from his new medicine.
Brownbeard declares to the Straw Hat Pirates that Law is definitely going to save him. He informs them that two years ago, due to the incident that happened on Sabaody Archipelago, the eleven rookies present then and Blackbeard are now known to others as “the Worst Generation”. He begins telling them about the island’s history when it housed Dr. Vegapunk’s laboratory. The island was once full of life before a chemical weapon test went horribly wrong, causing a massive explosion that destroyed two out of three laboratories. Heat and toxic substances were also released into the air, eliminating life. The prisoners who served as test subjects were abandoned by the World Government and became paralyzed due to the gas. However, they were miraculously saved by Caesar when he arrived at the island. The air was purified and the prisoners could move again through means provided by Caesar. Brownbeard was also saved when he arrived at the island afterwards. Their situation improved when Law showed up. He used his ability to attach the legs of living animals onto them and enabled them to walk once more. The Straw Hats are touched and now understands the presence of centaurs, bird woman and sheep on the island.
Smoker is also telling his subordinates about the explosion that occurred on the island. However, he states that the person responsible for creating the weapon and causing the explosion was actually Caesar Clown. He reveals that Caesar was the second in command and he was arrested. However, due to his ability, Caesar escaped from the prison ship and went missing. Smoker declares that they have to stop Caesar if he is still doing research because it is bound to be something devastating.
The centaur that Caesar promised to treat is having difficulty breathing while Caesar grins evilly and questions him relentlessly, treating him as a test subject for his “new medicine"". He kills him afterwards when he got an unsatisfactory response. When Monet questions Caesar about his failure, he is enraged and proclaims that his experiments never fail. He refuses to accept that the explosion was the result of a failed experiment, since he “killed” the whole island. He states that he is capable of killing the most enemies and he will let the World Government find out that he is the greatest scientist in the world.","Smoker (in Tashigi's body), Tashigi (in Smoker's body), Sind, Tony Tony Chopper (in Sanji's body), Franky (in Chopper's body), Sanji (in Nami's body), Mocha (flashback), Caesar Clown, Monet, Nami (in Franky's body), Usopp, Monkey D.

On the desert route Brook and Roshi fake heat exhaustion and claim that indecent acts from Nami and Rin will help them recover, which is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Franky irritates Android 18 by insisting how ""Super"" being a cyborg is. Elsewhere, Trunks and Goten use Fusion to become Gotenks; Chopper attempts to perform fusion himself, but his only partner is a disgusted Sunny, who refuses. Luffy, Toriko and Goku take the most difficult path: the mountain route. Goku races ahead of the other two but is summoned by Kaiō to stop an incoming dangerous creature from space. At the edge of the forest, Tina reports as Zoro arrives lost and is quickly challenged by Zebra. Having just heard of the race, Vegeta arrives looking for Goku, but quickly ends up in a three way challenge with the other two, prompting Tina to run in panic and end her coverage.
Luffy, Toriko, and Goku (having already defeated the space creature) reach the finish line and grab the Goal flag at the same time, instigating a battle between the three for victory; As the battle arena is assembled, Mr. Satan accidentally falls in and the other announcers assume he is competing alongside the three finalists. Luffy, Goku, and Toriko underestimate their attacks and destroy most of the arena, leaving only a small section where Mr. Satan is cowering. Because of this, Mr. Satan is technically the only contender still in bounds and wins the tournament. Mr. Satan decides to share the meat between all the finalists and their friends as a mysterious creature approaches the island.
Mr. Satan shares the Carat Sizzled Cattle prize with the rest of the group, pointing out that he will enjoy it more by sharing it with his friends. During the meal, Robin, Piccolo and Coco become suspicious of the IGO's motives and question Mansam. Mansam reveals that the tournament was a plan to gather the world's strongest fighters and capture the Deep Sea Glutton creature Akami, which has the ability to suck out the energy of living things. Akami jumps out from the sea and steals the power of Usopp, Mr. Satan, and Gohan, becoming larger and stronger. Akami escapes and Setsuno informs everyone that they have 30 minutes to catch it and save those it attacked.
Sanji, Brook, Franky, Sunny, Coco, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks all attempt to attack Akami, but have their energy drained as well, allowing Akami to evolve into a more powerful form. Luffy, Toriko and Goku find and attack Akami, and are impressed by each other's fighting skills. Their attack is unsuccessful however, as Akami can now absorb the power of attacks thrown at it too. Therefore, Toriko realizes that they need to use an attack powerful enough to defeat Akami in a single hit. Goku asks Luffy and Torkio to distract Akaimi while he charges a Genki Dama (""Spirit Bomb""), borrowing energy from the living beings around him. As Akami begins stealing energy from the charging Spirit Bomb, Goku requests that the other people at the tournament lend their energy to the attack too. Luffy, Toriko and Goku hit Akaimi with a Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gatling, Hit Nail Punch and Kamehameha alongside the Spirit Bomb, finishing off Akami. The group celebrates with a banquet, eating Akami, while Zoro, Zebra and Vegeta are still fighting elsewhere on the island.","Monkey D.

Episode 591,Chopper Enraged - Master's Inhumane Experiments,14-Apr-13,"The children and the Straw Hat Pirates are in a cave with Brownbeard tied up talking about the Master. Zoro, Sanji and Brook go to look for Kin'emon, who had gone to look for his torso. The children then start to fall over in pain while asking for candy. Chopper, who had been testing them for any sickness, reveals that they had been given a highly addictive drug and are suffering from withdrawal. The children then attack the Straw Hats, who could not fight back without injuring the children, and eventually Usopp uses his Bakusui Boshi attack to put them to sleep.
Back in the lab, Trafalgar Law gives Smoker's heart to Caesar, who had sent the Yeti Cool Brothers to deal with the Straw Hats. The Yeti Cool Brothers are then shown talking to each other while Zoro, Sanji and Brook are lying unconscious nearby.","Franky is trying to get used to being in Chopper's body. He manages to change into Guard Point, and comments on how unstable Chopper's body is with all of its different forms. Chopper responds that he is used to it. The children roll Franky around in the snow, while Luffy rides on top of him. Sanji learns from Brook that the samurai has left to find his torso, and becomes worried for his safety as he has no means of defending himself with just his head and legs, while Sanji held himself responsible for his safety when he was just a head. Luffy grants Sanji and Brook permission to search for the samurai. When Brook asks Sanji to let him see his (Nami's) panties, and Sanji becomes excited at the prospect of taking pictures of Nami's body, Nami becomes furious and convinces Zoro to go along as well, reasoning that Sanji and Zoro's inevitable fighting rivalry will distract Sanji from doing perverted things with her body. Sure enough, within moments Sanji and Zoro are arguing, Zoro being angry that he had to come along because of Sanji's perverse new attitude, and Sanji angry at Zoro for not understanding how ecstatic the body switching situation has made him. Brook is pummeled by Nami as punishment, and to deter him from wanting to see her panties.
The rest of the Straw Hats discuss their next course of action. Nami's first priority is restoring everyone back to their original bodies, as she dislikes being in Franky's body, as she considers him to be a pervert. Franky (who has now transformed into Chopper's Brain Point) takes Nami's insult as a compliment, making a typical Franky face in Chopper's body that disgusts Robin. Franky notes that whatever they do, the children will be a burden.
Chopper finishes conducting tests on the children. Immediately after, the largest child, Sind, falls to the ground in pain. Luffy asks Chopper to heal him, but one by one the rest of the giant children fall over, holding their heads in their hands. Nami asks Chopper whether the children were really sick, to which he replies that they were not. He asks Sind whether there is something he wants, and what, if any, kinds of activities they do around that time every day. Sind, still in agony, tells him that every day all of the children would get examined and be given candy. Chopper is confused about the candy, and the other children say that the candy is strange, and tastes good. Sind says that he feels really happy when he eats it, and is convinced that it will stop the pain. Chopper, having learned the truth about the children, becomes furious. He yells at the chained up Brownbeard that the children aren't actually sick, as they had previously been told. Brownbeard maintains that although he does not know much of what goes on inside, their benefactor, Master, is a loving scientist who rescued the children and gave them free medicine. According to him, the fact that the children are in pain and have not received their daily medicine proves that they are ill, but Chopper responds with the results of his analysis—there is a tiny but sufficient quantity of a drug known as NHC10 in each of their bodies. The drug is a powerful stimulant, the use of which is tightly restricted throughout the world due to the danger it comes with and its addictive properties. Chopper learned about the drug during his time with Dr. Kureha, in which he learned that proper use of it in medicine requires using only a very tiny amount, in order to prevent addiction. Chopper concludes that the children have been given small amounts of the drug every day for a long period of time, so that the addiction forces them to remain within the research facility. Chopper demands to know from Brownbeard what his master's purpose is for the children, but Brownbeard is angry at him, believing that Chopper is merely insulting his savior.
Luffy suggests going to the research facility to find candy to stop the withdrawal symptoms, but Chopper says not to, as the candy is the means by which the drugs are delivered. Sind begs Luffy for candy, who refuses, trusting Chopper's judgment as the crew's doctor. Sind lowers his hands from his face, revealing bloodshot eyes, a runny nose and saliva dripping from his mouth, which frightens the other children. He goes berserk at Luffy for not getting the candy when he originally said he would, launching him into a nearby fallen pillar. Robin is amazed at Sind's physical strength. Usopp, while surprised, comments that this must be the strength of a giant child, but the other children reveal that none of them are actually giants; all of them were normal size when they first came to the island, and have grown more and more the longer they have remained on the island. One of the children believes that the growing must be the 'sickness' they were told they had, but Chopper disagrees, instead concluding that the rapid growth has come from experiments that have increased the levels of their pituitary hormone.
As the rest of the children gradually enter withdrawal as well, Luffy prepares to subdue them, but in order to ensure no harm comes to them Usopp instead successfully puts them to sleep with his new Sleeping Star attack. Having discovered that the children really were kidnapped, Chopper wants to save the children and return them to their parents, but Franky and Robin note that first they have to find the real culprit behind the experiments: Master. Chopper and Nami stay behind to look after the children, although Chopper expresses a desire for revenge against Master, and Nami's reasoning for staying behind appears to be fear (according to Usopp). Luffy has the largest children restrained with chains, to prevent them rampaging again. Luffy, Usopp, Robin, and Franky prepare to go to the research facility to meet Master, though Franky mentions the fact that at some point they will have to find Trafalgar Law in order to restore their bodies. Luffy seems to think it unnecessary, as he is enjoying the hijinks that have occurred.
In the research facility, Caesar Clown, Trafalgar Law, and Monet are sitting around a table. Caesar holds Smoker's heart in his hand, while Law looks on silently, with a displeased look in his eyes and a frown. Caesar is in good spirits thanks to the capture of Smoker's heart, and says he has already sent soldiers to the Marines and that he knows what the outcome of that will be. Law asks what happened to Straw Hat, and Caesar explains that, having taken Monet's warning about the Straw Hats' possible increase in strength seriously, he sent two powerful people after him: The Hitmen of the Snowy Mountain, the ""Yeti Cool Brothers"". The two of them are seen from behind in silhouette. They are enormous figures, each with a rifle on their back.
The scene changes to road to the mountain behind the research facility. Zoro, Sanji, and Brook are all lying in the snow. Zoro and Sanji are face-down, while Brook is face-up and spread-eagled, with his drawn sword sticking out of the snow near his head. The shot is expanded to reveal that the trio is in the middle of a trail of two sets of gigantic footprints, each barefoot and several times larger than a human body.","Franky (in Chopper's body), Tony Tony Chopper (in Sanji's body), Brook, Brownbeard, Nami (in Franky's body), Monkey D.

Monet tells Caesar Clown about Law having some relation to Luffy, which makes Caesar mistrust Law until Law reassures him. The Yeti Cool Brothers attack the cave and shoot Brownbeard. They take Nami who is in Franky's body. Luffy arrives and attempts to rescue Nami but fails. Law is halted by two of Caesar's men as he leaves and attacks them.","The Yeti Cool Brothers radio in to Caesar, saying they successfully killed Nami, Zoro, and Brook, and ask that they be collected. In the research facility, Clown is talking to Monet, having just received the news that some of the Straw Hats were killed. Monet is surprised that they died so easily, after reading all the newspapers that were written about them, and mentions that Law had encountered them twice before. Clown pulls out a gun, points it at Law, and asks him if he had called the Straw Hats to the island. Law reiterates that he did not even know they were on the island until they ran into him at the front door. Law adds that if the place gets found out, it would be bad for him as well.
Clown remembers when Law first came to the island. He and Law were talking indoors, and Law said that he wanted to stay on the island since it could not be caught on a Log Pose. It also contains remains of government research that he seemed to be interested in. All he asked for was free roam of the island, and that neither of them ask the other too personal questions. Law also made it very clear that no one was to know that he is on the island, not even Caesar Clown's employer: ""Joker"". Clown says that he sees no harm in trusting Law, and asks Monet if she agrees. She looks up from copying notes about Law and asks if he could heal the prisoners on the island who were paralyzed by the poisonous gas, ending the flashback. Clown tells Law that if he calls the kids back he will do even better and he doubts someone who sucked up to the government in order to become a Shichibukai would make things too difficult for them. Clown turns to leave, but Law asks what he meant by the kids coming back. Clown explains about the drugged candy, holding up a piece to show Law. Law comments that Clown's nastiness reminds him of someone else. Monet asks about a fight with the Marines as Law turns to leave. Law tells them to call him if they need anything. Clown comments that people who think too much can be difficult to handle.
At the remains of one of the research labs, there is an explosion. Nami gets scared and Chopper realizes they are under attack. He is worried about the children, as the roof might collapse on them. Chopper peeks out and tells Nami he cannot see who is attacking them. Outside, Luffy and the others hear the explosion and notice the huge footprints in the snow. Luffy senses two huge animal-like beings near Nami and Chopper. Brownbeard hears the explosion and gets hopeful that someone is coming to save him. He then realizes that it must be the Yeti Cool Brothers. Nami asks him what he's talking about. He tells her that no one has seen them, but for the right price they will kill anyone they are asked to. They are hairy twenty five year olds named Rock and Scotch. Just then, one of the brothers appears from behind Nami and Chopper, frightening the daylights out of them. The yeti has his gun pointed at Brownbeard, saying he is on Clown's kill list. Brownbeard asks if the yeti pointing the gun at him is Rock, and he replies that he is Scotch. He tells Scotch there must have been a mistake and he is assigned to take out the Straw Hats. Scotch plays a recording of Clown calling Brownbeard a useless idiot and giving the order to kill him. Brownbeard is crushed by the fact that the man he believed so much in betrayed him. His last thought is of when Clown once called him a good leader. Scotch then shoots him and Brownbeard goes up in flames. Rock then warns Scotch not to shoot too much or else the roof will collapse on the kids. Luffy then comes back, angry at what he just saw. The yetis shoot at him but miss. He comes at them with a flying kick, but they suddenly vanish. Luffy rebounds off the facility and lands in a snow drift. Chopper runs up, saying that they took Nami.
The Yeti Cool Brothers are seen somewhere else, one of them holding Nami in his hand. Franky's body was the only one that they were ordered to bring back alive, since it had Vegapunk's laser. In the back of the research facility, Law is going out. A guard warns him about the Marines. Law tells him that he does not care and that he can go anywhere he wants, cutting the guard up before leaving.","Mocha, Doran, Sind, Konbu, Uzu, Nami (in Franky's body), Usopp, Franky (in Chopper's body), Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper (in Sanji's body), Monkey D.

Luffy becomes angry at Caesar for betraying Brownbeard. Franky wants to use rumble ball so Chopper gives him one. He then takes it, turns into the monster form and chases after Luffy because he cannot control it.
Caesar realizes that Franky has Vegapunk's Pacifista beam and wants it. G-5 are fighting against centaurs and Caesar's men. They are losing until Smoker and Tashigi show up.

Episode 594,Formed! The Luffy-Law Pirate Alliance!,5-May-13,"Luffy and Law agree on an alliance; the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates disapprove while Nico Robin approves, even if she warns Luffy about a possible betrayal in a pirate alliance. Law switches Nami, Franky and Chopper's bodies again. Nami ends up in Sanji's body because Sanji is far away with Zoro and Brook. Law tells them that they can not go back once things start moving, for example capturing Caesar Clown who has the Logia type Gasu Gasu no Mi. He warns them that he is highly dangerous and therefore they need Haki users to beat him. Luffy says that the Haki users are him, Law, Zoro and Sanji.
The marines are continuing their fight against Caesar's men. The three centaurs open the door and see a big slop of slime that seeps out poison gas, most of them die and two survive so they run as it chases them. Caesar calls the pet slime monster Smiley and says that the Straw Hats and the G-5 marines are being used as test subjects for it.","The episode begins with Law explaining his proposal of an alliance to Luffy and Nami. Law reveals he has found a way to take down one of the Four Emperors but Nami disagrees with the idea of forming an alliance and tries to convince Luffy not to agree. However, Luffy asks Law which one of the Four Emperors he is talking about and after hearing his answer he agrees to his proposal, leaving Nami shocked.
Back at the Straw Hat Pirates' camp, Usopp and Chopper are shocked by the news of an alliance with the Heart Pirates, causing Usopp to yell at Luffy for returning with such an eccentric idea whilst Nami points out that everyone disagrees with the proposal. Law then asks Chopper to treat Franky (in Chopper's body) leaving Chopper frantic at how badly hurt his body is and immediately tries to bandage it up. Robin states she is happy to go along with Luffy's decision but also warns him that alliances are often marked by betrayal and that it's dangerous for him since he is so trusting. In response, Luffy asks Law if he will betray them and when he answers no Luffy smiles with absolute trust, prompting Usopp to yell at him to at least have some doubts. Luffy says to his crew that Law is a good man but even if he isn't he has all of them, who have been training for 2 years, to rely on. Nami, Usopp, Chopper and Franky then become flattered by how much their captain believes in them. Law then puts Franky and Chopper back into their respective bodies whilst Nami is put into Sanji's since Sanji (who is in Nami's body) isn't around, leaving Nami upset and asking Law if there is anything he can do but he explains that there isn't.
Law then reveals that the children are drugged but Chopper replies that he already knows and expresses his desire to send the children home for them to recover. Law further reveals that turning people into giants was a project by the World Government, presumably for military purposes, and that Caesar had wanted to achieve it first as it means to surpass both Vegapunk and the World Government. Law then questions if Nami really wants to help the children and she replies that she does, as she thinks of the children who had asked for her help with tears in their eyes, and firmly states that she will not leave the island unless she knows for certain that the children are safe. Law asks if she will be willing to stay on the island alone, as he has no intention of aiding the children, however Luffy says that he will not leave his friends behind and that Chopper's and Nami's wish is his as well. Luffy also informs Law that Sanji wanted to help the samurai and that if he wanted to team up, he will have to help them. Usopp sighs and explains to Law that Luffy's idea of an alliance is different from that of Law's. Deciding to compromise, Law splits the tasks, telling Luffy to take care of the samurai while he researches the drug, requesting the Straw Hat Pirate's doctor to go with him. Chopper is then comically tied onto Law's hat, as he is too injured to move, which prompts everyone to laugh at the scene and leaves Law embarrassed.
At the burning lands, the centaurs are unlocking the huge door. They walk in and encounter a massive shape, but they cannot tell what it is due to the darkness. A centaur steps closer but clutches at his throat and falls. Gases are release in streams around the shape.
Law carries Chopper by tying a rope around his sword with the other end tied to Chopper. Law then warns Luffy and his crew that Caesar is going to get rid of almost everyone on the island and reclaim the children as he cannot risk the government finding out about the island, which is his perfect hiding spot. He informs them that Caesar has a 300 million bounty, owns weapons of mass destruction and that people who cannot utilize Haki should avoid him. Luffy says that there are only four Haki users available: Law, Zoro, Sanji and himself.
Law answers Luffy's question and confirms that their objective is to kidnap Caesar. However, despite the Straw Hat Pirates being puzzled at to the reason why they must capture him, Law chooses not to explain, saying that there is no point in telling them when Caesar has not been kidnapped yet and asks them to focus because it will not be an easy task. He further warns them that when Caesar is captured, the ball will start rolling and there will be no turning back, giving them the final chance to reconsider their decision. However, Luffy says that it is fine and remains steadfast.
At the fight between the Marines and the centaurs, Tashigi has identified some of them as former prisoners. Smoker is confused and wonders why four years ago, the government had said that there were no survivors.
The Den Den Mushi is ringing but Caesar refuses to answer it, having already predicted the nature of the call. True to his words, the centaur at the burning land is trying to contact Caesar. Something has flown out of the door that was opened and had killed all except two of the centaurs, who are now running. However there is no escape from the slimy like substance flows throughout the land, leaving a wake of destruction behind. It releases a cloud of gas that engulfs the centaurs and they slowly choke and faint. Caesar explains to his subordinate about his pet, saying that it is a very rare type of slime-like creature. He names it Smiley and states that no one will be able to leave the island.","Nami (in Franky's body, after in Sanji's body), Monkey D.

Episode 595,Capture Master - The Pirate Alliance's Operation Begins!,12-May-13,"Zoro, Sanji, and Brook are trying to find the samurai and remember what happened to them. They had been knocked out by the Yeti Cool Brothers, who used a gas that makes people drunk. The Yeti Cool Brothers then try to make them fall into a pit of spikes but Zoro cut the spikes before he passed out. Caesar's hazmat subordinates attack them but fail thanks to Sanji. They find the samurai's head and legs frozen and unfroze him. He then explains that he couldn't swim because of his magic and said that it felt like his torso was underwater. They see Smiley far away.
Meanwhile, Caesar Clown explains that Smiley is a chemical experiment that caused the explosion in Punk Hazard.
Law and Chopper are heading to the lab, using Law's room ability to move faster. They then see the G-5 Marines attempting to break inside lab and Luffy, Franky and Nico Robin arriving out of nowhere, surprising the Marines and Caesar's subordinates.","Sanji's group is recovering from the fall and the effects of the KYP gas. Sanji wonders if the samurai is alright. Zoro argues that Sanji wanted to take the shortcut, but the cook fires back that they all agreed to go. Brook remembers the shadows he saw before they fell unconscious. Zoro argues that no one was there while Sanji disagrees. There is a flashback to an hour ago, when the group finds the footprints. Brook calls Zoro and Sanji over to look at the giant footprints. He thinks they might belong to the legendary yeti. Zoro and Sanji tell him to not be ridiculous. Brook gets excited, stating that beyond here lies the dream of man as all three imagine what the yeti looks like. They follow the footprints to the edge of a cliff, turn around, and see two large shadows and hear the sound of guns getting cocked. The Yeti Cool Brothers shoot them with the KYP bullets. Rock explains that the gas can put even the heaviest drinker into a complete stupor. He also tells them about section F-16, home of the icicle pincushion. They blast the tip of the cliff off with their rifles, sending the inebriated pirates with it. Zoro, in his last moments of consciousness, manages to cut the plateau containing the icicles, saving himself and the others.
In area F-16, a collection team discovers the three unconscious bodies. Sanji grabs the leg of one of the soldiers, surprising him. He surprises the soldiers even further by completely defeating the whole group. He realizes that he has to be careful, as Nami's body is far more delicate than his own. He then punches Zoro and Brook in the head to wake them up. Sanji asks Brook if he thinks the samurai is nearby. Brook says he remembers seeing the torso around here. The crew steps on a body unconscious in the snow; first Sanji, then Brook, and then Zoro notices the body and realizes it is the samurai. He is completely frozen. Sanji stomps on the Samurai's head, breaking the ice. The samurai gasps for air. He tells them that he suddenly became paralyzed. He says he is not cold, but Sanji calls him out on his lie. He explains that his ability prevents him from swimming and right now it feels like his torso is under water. Zoro and Brook reason that the torso fell in the salt water lake. Zoro concludes that if he can still feel it, then the sharks have not eaten the torso yet. Sanji realizes they do not have much time and they need to recover the samurai's torso. The samurai is surprised by this kind of kindness coming from pirates. Sanji tells him it is strictly out of responsibility and the second their body issues are taken care of, he is going to fight and beat the samurai to a pulp. The samurai then thanks Sanji. Sanji remarks that he is finally showing some gratitude and maybe everyone should get frozen once.
They then see a group in the distance. It is the Centaur Patrol Unit. They are running from the monster that appeared at the lake. Zoro asks what they are talking about. The centaurs then notice the pirates, angry that they lost, but keep moving. Zoro then looks toward the lake, and does not seem to remember the enormous mountain currently there.
The scene changes to inside the lab. Caesar Clown is talking about how Slime is the same thing that caused the massive explosion four years ago. Everyone thinks Caesar purified the toxic gas, but Caesar reveals that he simply condensed it and, not wanting to be wasteful, compressed it into Slime. He goes on to say that just because people forget a tragedy does not mean it is gone. In fact, it was sitting in the palm of Caesar's hand all this time.
Outside the front of the lab, the G-5 Marines are stealing a ship. Tashigi tries to hold off some enemies, but accidentally transforms into smoke and cannot control it. Smoker tells her to get out of the way and asks if the door barring their escape is open. A soldier responds that the enemy is in the lab and the door will not move. This irritates Smoker, as it would all be easier if he were in his own body.
Behind the lab, Law and Chopper warp into one of Law's Rooms. Law explains where they are and where Caesar and Monet are. He tells Chopper to investigate the drugs while he works on a way to get Caesar and Monet out of the building. Chopper asks why Law could not just capture them since they trust Law so much, making infiltration easy for him. Law tells Chopper he has a certain problem that prevents him from capturing them so easily. The Straw Hats need to capture Caesar as quickly as possible and Law will do the rest. Law then hears screaming. Tashigi looks up to see something flying toward them, thinking it to be a huge bomb. It turns out to be Luffy, Robin, and Franky. Luffy and Franky crash into the bow of the destroyed Marine ship. Robin avoids the impact by using Wing. Robin lands delicately while Franky punches his way out of the wrecked ship. Luffy then shouts for ""Master"" to get outside so they can beat him up and kidnap him. Franky comments on how good of a shortcut they took while Robin reminds them they are supposed to be secretive. Law is irritated by Luffy's conspicuous entrance, while Smoker and the rest of G-5 are surprised to see him.","Roronoa Zoro, Brook, Sanji (in Nami's body), Yeti Cool Brothers (flashback), Kin'emon, Smiley (shadowed, imagination), Caesar Clown, Monet, Sind (sleeping), Konbu (sleeping), Uzu (sleeping, not fully seen), Franky, Monkey D.

Caesar then appears in the lab, explaining that Smiley was his experiment and that it is weak against water. After his speech, Luffy jumps up and grabs him.","Monkey D.

Episode 597,An Intense Battle - Caesar Exercises His True Ability!,26-May-13,"Sanji, Kin'emon, Brook and Zoro see Smiley. Brook talks about a story about a creature called Slime which melts the clothes of women, making everyone act perverted except for Zoro, who points out that the slime is killing the fish in the lake, prompting Sanji to jump in to find Kin'emon's torso. Law tells Monet to take a walk with him while Chopper is left in the lab to find the antidote.
Luffy faces off against Caesar who uses with his Gas Robe attack until he discovers that Luffy is immune to poison. Caesar then uses his Gastanets and Smiley to injure Luffy who then grabs Caesar. Caesar then knocks Luffy out with an unknown ability. Robin, Franky, Tashigi and Smoker get knocked out as well. Law and Monet are walking down a hallway and encounter a mysterious figure who causes Law to break down in pain while the mysterious figure tells him that it's been a long time since they last met.","Brook recognizes Slime, saying he read about it in a book once. They attack women and use their bodies to melt the woman's clothes. Sanji and Kin'emon are intrigued and ask to borrow the book later. Zoro directs their attention to the lake, saying that the slime from the creature is probably dangerous to touch, as the slime that fell into the lake has killed all the fish. Brook asks Sanji if he is really going to look for Kin'emon's torso. Sanji says he is, and it is something only he can do. He apologizes to Nami in advance, saying he is the best swimmer among them, promising to return before anything bad happens to Nami's body. He tells the others to take care of the slime creatures nearby as dives in, realizing that cold does not even come close to describing the water temperature.
Inside the lab, Law sees his chance as he and Monet are alone in the room. She tells him that Caesar is not there. Law gently sets down the bag containing Chopper on the couch, asking where Caesar went. Considering her boss' bad taste, she concludes that he is probably watching the fighting outside. Law tells her that he is almost done on the island and will be leaving soon. Monet seems disappointed, saying it will be lonely without him. He tells her he wants to borrow her ability for a bit, asking her to come with him. Monet teasingly calls it a date and goes with him, commenting on how cold Law is. When she asks him what he wants, he tells her she will understand when she gets there. Chopper then recognizes Monet as the bird-woman Usopp was talking about.
Outside the lab, Luffy has grabbed Caesar, to the latter's annoyance. The centaurs and satyrs aim their guns at Luffy, angry that he would lay a hand on their master. Franky recognizes that Luffy is using Haki, and is amazed by the ability. Robin tells him that Armament Haki is the ability to grab a Logia user in their intangible state. However, unlike seastone or the ocean, it does not nullify the ability. They still do not know the true power of the Gasu Gasu no Mi, so the battle is far from over. Her explanation is supported as Luffy tries to attack Caesar with a Haki-infused Gomu Gomu no Bell, but Caesar dodges by extending his torso. Caesar then uses Gas Robe, throwing it at Luffy's head.
He laughs as he tells Luffy to inhale, saying he has done countless experiments on how lethal his gas is. Then, to everyone's surprise, Luffy inhales all of the poisonous gas, looking like apparent suicide to those watching. To surprise the spectators even more, Luffy releases the gas from his ears like a steam whistle. He tells Caesar that poisons do not work that well on him anymore, thanks to Magellan. Caesar is offended that he would be compared to a Paramecia Devil Fruit user. While he is fuming over the insult, Luffy attacks him with Gomu Gomu no Jet Mace.
Caesar falls down to earth with a crash. His subordinates are angry that Luffy would do that to him, and prepare to attack them. Caesar insults them, calling them peons and orders them not to touch him. His subordinates are surprised by the insult. Luffy gets ready to attack Caesar with Gomu Gomu no Gatling, but before he can, Caesar hits a pair of castanets together, causing an explosion called Gastonet. Luffy is caught in the blast, and Robin becomes worried. To make her concern worse, Caesar orders the smaller pieces of Slime to attach themselves to Luffy, causing a blinding explosion. When the smoke clears, there is no sign of Luffy. Caesar begins to laugh victoriously, only for Luffy to appear behind him and comment on how close and how big the explosion was, much to Caesar's comically stunned surprise. Luffy then attacks him with Gomu Gomu no Jet Stamp. Franky and Robin breathe a sigh of relief, as Luffy grabs Caesar.
He shouts to Franky and Robin if they have anything to contain Caesar, since they cannot tie up a Logia. Franky wonders if there is a barrel nearby. A Marine calls out that they will take Caesar into custody, and bring Luffy along too. Tashigi tells Smoker that Luffy captured Caesar, and he seems indifferent. Suddenly, Luffy has trouble breathing and passes out. Caesar stands over him, saying Luffy took him far too lightly. Franky, Robin, Tashigi, and even Smoker are all surprised and confused by what just transpired. Robin tries to save Luffy, but passes out too, prompting Franky to charge and attempt to attack, only for him to pass out as well. He then does the same to Tashigi and Smoker and stands over all four of them victoriously.
Back inside the lab, Law and Monet are walking. Law is clutching his chest in pain, and seems to be having difficulty breathing. He tries to speak and falls to his knees, making Monet concerned. He looks into the darkness and asks who is out there. A man steps out, saying he is the one Law felt. Law, who seems bothered to see him, asks what he is doing here as Monet giggles. The man asks how long it has been, remarking how much Law has grown.","Smiley, Roronoa Zoro, Brook, Sanji (in Nami's body), Kin'emon, Monet, Trafalgar Law, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 598,The Samurai Who Cuts Fire! Foxfire Kin'emon!,2-Jun-13,"Law's heart is crushed by the mysterious man named Vergo who was sent along with Monet to watch over Caesar. Law gets knocked out by Vergo who had a bamboo stick with him imbued with Haki. Caesar tells his men to tie up the Straw Hats and G-5. Meanwhile Chopper is looking for a way to cure the children.
Zoro's group are waiting for Sanji to rescue the samurai's torso. Sanji uses Haki to find the body and realizes it is in a shark's mouth. He manages to escape before the gas consumes him. The samurai then reveals himself as Kin'emon. He demonstrates his ability by cutting fire and by destroying the slime. He then attempts to find his son, Momonosuke. Zoro's group decides to aid him.","Law is seen writhing in pain in front of the mysterious man named Vergo who revealed he was sent along with Monet to watch over Caesar. Before Law could muster some strength to retaliate, Vergo squeezes his heart which he has in his hand and proceeds to knock out Law with a Haki imbued Bamboo stick.
At the entrance of the lab, the G-5 marines are shocked at the scene before them, finding it hard to believe that Smoker was defeated twice in a day. The crews are wondering what attack did Caesar used to defeat their officers and the three Straw Hats as well. Caesar commands his men to tie up the unconscious Straw Hats and G-5 officers and they obeyed unquestioningly, leaving the G-5 marines helpless to do anything.
While still waiting for Sanji who went to retrieve the samurai's torso from the water, Zoro's group are having trouble defending themselves from the slimes because cutting it only results in the slimes expelling poison gas. The samurai is watching the waters worried when he suddenly begin to shout in pain, puzzling Zoro and Brook. In the murky waters, Sanji uses Haki to find the body and discovers it in a shark's mouth. After besting the shark, he rescued the torso and quickly used Blue Walk in Nami's body to escape before the poison could consumed the entire lake. With the samurai restored, he introduces himself as Kin'emon. He expresses his gratitude profusely to Sanji.
Meanwhile Chopper is currently infiltrating Caesar's private lab and is looking for a way to cure the children.
Caesar's men are standing guard over the captives, who are bounded in chains. When Caesar knew that the airship has been prepared, he plans to head out and find the children to administer the drug candy. He gives orders for the captives to be caged and secured in his chambers.
The slimes surrounded Zoro's group. Sanji scolds Brook and Zoro for not dealing with them. Kin'emon suggest that they should burn the slimes, revealing that he can burn and slice an enemy with his sword. He demonstrates his power by igniting the surrounding slime with his sword, which exploded shortly. He proceeds to cut the explosion as well, saving the group. With the way cleared, Kin'emon declares that he is going to save his son. He thanks the group for aiding him and leaves for the laboratory. However, Zoro was interested in the style Kin'emon used and decides to aid him.","Trafalgar Law, Vergo, Monet, Smiley, Caesar Clown, Smoker (in Tashigi's body, K.O.), Monkey D.

Caesar takes the children from Usopp and Nami. The slime is going after Zoro's group. It is revealed that Vergo works for Joker and that Joker is Doflamingo.,"It starts off with Vergo still punishing Law. Law reveals that Vergo is the base commander of the G-5 Marine Base. Then it cuts to an unknown island inhabited by the G-5 Marines. They are extremely rude and take what they please. Then the citizens ask if they could look for their missing children, revealing that the children in Caesar Clown's laboratory were in fact kidnapped from this island. The Marines refused to help because they said Vergo already looked over the missing reports and said they have all died.
It then cuts to Nami and Usopp who are still dealing with the children who are going through severe withdrawals from not getting any of their drug candy. Suddenly Caesar Clown appears and convinces the children to come back to the laboratory by bribing them with candy.
The scene then cuts to Zoro's group who are still dealing with Smiley. Smiley is furious that Kin'emon destroyed so much of the slime and decides to send huge slime attacks at them chasing them back to the laboratory.
The scene then goes to Luffy, Law, Robin, Franky, Tashigi, and Smoker in a prison cell and are introduced to both Vergo and Monet. Meanwhile Caesar Clown's soldiers close all entrances to the laboratory leaving the G-5 Marines stranded outside to deal with Smiley.
Vergo and Monet talk about what Caesar is planning but both are still not quite sure what he is planning. Smoker then calls out Vergo saying that his subordinates will die if he doesn't do anything. But Vergo couldn't care less about what happens to them. Then Smoker pieces it all together with Tahigi's theory and realizes that Vergo is responsible for the cover-ups behind the missing children in the New World. Law then states that Vergo was never really loyal to the marines because he was originally a pirate all along, working for the notorious underworld broker ""Joker"". Vergo then threatens both Tashigi and Smoker saying that they will both die, leaving his secret in tact. Luffy then asks Law ""who is Joker"" and Law responds that he also worked for him once and someone that they all know who is a notorious pirate that works for the World Government.

Meanwhile, Zoro's group is still running from Smiley which has finally transferred itself to the ice lands, causing all of its pieces to converge together. At the ruined Lab, Usopp and Nami are confronted by Caesar who mercilessly suffocates them the same way he did to Luffy, but is interrupted by the revived Brownbeard who demands his crew back. However, Caesar beats him and proceeds to do the same to the two escaping Straw Hat Pirates.
With the children secured and on their way back to the lab, Caesar Clown sends orders to Monet to prepare the Den Den Mushi to broadcast his ""Special Experiment"" to all known brokers to show them his weapon of mass destruction, among the viewers are the two Supernovas, Eustass Kid and Killer.","Luffy and his group are still being watched by Vergo and Monet. Luffy doesn't know Doflamingo but suddenly remembered him by Smoker asking him that he already seen him back at the Navy Headquarters. Tashigi commented that Doflamingo attacked Moria after the War of the Best
It then cuts to Caesar Clown entering the lab where Nami and Usopp are hiding the drugged children. The children are still going rampant due to the drug candy's withdrawal symptoms and one of them attacks Nami. Usopp tries to attack Caesar, but fails. Caesar then explains how his ability allows him to control the air itself and suffocates Nami and Usopp by depriving them of oxygen. He then tells the children to finish off Nami and Usopp, by crushing them with metal poles, if they want candy. But before they could, Brownbeard appears and saves them and is furious on Caesar's deceits. Caesar then orders the children to go on his ship, announcing it wasn't safe to stay. Afterwards, Brownbeard tries to fight Caesar, but in the end Caesar uses Gastanet and causes an explosion on Brownbeard. He then turns to Nami and Usopp and performs another Gastanet, which knocks them out.
The scene then changes to Zoro's group who are still getting chased by Smiley. All of Smiley's pieces have managed to cross the lake and are beginning to merge. Meanwhile, the G-5 Marines are dealing with the Smiley pieces outside of Caesar's lab.
Caesar then calls Monet and asks if the broadcast is ready. He then sends a televised message to all the Pirates in the New World, saying he is selling a Weapon of Mass Destruction that the Marines wish they had.

Episode 601,Shaking Up the New World - Caesar's Nightmarish Experiment,23-Jun-13,"At the lab, the G-5 Marine soldiers are banging on the door, demanding entry. Meanwhile, the children are returned to the lab where Caesar orders his subordinates to make sure they do not escape again. However, Mocha begins to regain her senses, seeing Caesar's subordinates as monsters.
Within Caesar's private quarters, Vergo and Monet are waiting for Caesar's return. As soon as Caesar arrives, he reveals that he made a deal with Law in the past to give his heart to Caesar, and in exchange, Law would get to keep Monet's heart. He shows Law that Vergo is now in possession of Law's heart, while he himself has Smoker's heart, but before he could torture him, Monet informs Caesar that the broadcast is ready.
In the broadcast, it is shown that a very large candy is being offered to Smiley, which is a deadly weapon known as Shinokuni. Caesar then orders the men that brought the candy to quickly return to the lab. As Zoro's group are being chased by Smiley, the poison beast sees the candy and promptly swallows it, ignoring the false heartfelt words from Caesar. He then laughs as everyone watching the broadcast sees the creature behaving rather strangely.","Caesar Clown and the children are seen disembarking from the Flying Gas Balloon, surprising the nearby Marines and they question what the ship is. Entering the research laboratory through an upper entrance, Caesar reminds the children that the lab is their home and their candy is in the Biscuits Room. He then orders his subordinates to lock the doors and to make sure they do not escape again. As all of the children hurry inside eagerly, Mocha, who upon entering the room, begins to resist the addictive drug and remembers her frightening memories of the lab. Some of the satyrs attempt to calm her down, but she finally realizes that Nami and Usopp were trying to save the children from Caesar. Having realized what is exactly going on, she begins to try to escape again, crying out for Nami and Usopp to help her.
Far in the distance, back at the Straw Hat Pirates' make-shift hide out, Nami eventually regains consciousness, marveling at how strong Sanji's body is, and how it allowed her to survive Caesar's attack. Noticing Usopp beginning to awaken nearby, she moves to assist him. Confusing her with the real Sanji, Usopp lets slip his disappointment in it actually being Nami causing her to become rather abrasive.
Back in the laboratory, Caesar meets up with Monet and Vergo, the latter of the two talking about how they had just been drinking coffee with some cookies, only to quickly remember that there wasn't any cookies to be had. Asking Caesar when is he going to start the experiment, the mad scientist replies by asking Monet to collect some pictures, and tells Vergo to do a better job at keeping the Marines at bay, admitting that the arrival of Smoker and his men had caused him to become nervous.
Moving towards the cage, Caesar then reveals that he knows all of Law's plans due to Monet's tracking of Law with her abilities, and thanks Law for naively giving him his heart in exchange for Monet's heart as part of their contract. Vergo squeezes Law's heart, which results in Law screaming and trashing around in his restraints. Responding to Caesar's condescending gloat by insulting his intellectual abilities, Caesar becomes infuriated and grabs Law's heart (which was being held out by Vergo), and punches it, inflicting pain upon the Shichibukai. Law screams and trashes around some more, before laying still on the floor, breathing hard as he passes out. Luffy, impressed and shocked at how someone could still survive despite his heart no longer being inside his body, is cut off by Smoker who states that being undone by his own power is foolish and demands to know where his heart is currently being held. Holding it out before him, Caesar gloatingly mocks him about it.
Receiving a call from his subordinates, Caesar then resumes his broadcast to the brokers through a Den Den Mushi, explaining the nature of his pet/weapon Smiley and the history of the island. Pinpointing the one flaw of the weapon from four years ago, he then elaborates and explains that he had since eliminated said flaw, and by feeding Smiley with a special bait he prepared, the poisonous axolotl would became an improved weapon called Shinokuni; being an even stronger poisonous gas weapon than it was before.
Outside in the winter region, Smiley is shown to still be chasing after Sanji, Zoro, Brook, and Kin'emon, who marvel at its still growing size. They notice a giant candy in the distance with a big screen behind it and something underneath. Pulling the sweet across the plains, several of Caesar's subordinates and Vegapunk's dragon are then told by Caesar to escape before Smiley catches up to them. Realizing their sled is no longer usable, and the dragon having freed itself, the men quickly run away with the Straw Hats and Kin'emon trailing shortly behind. Reaching the sweet, Smiley briefly pauses after seeing Caesar on the display. Attempting to show his taming of the monster, Caesar begun issuing orders for the slime, but is ignored. Smiley then devours the large piece of candy.","Caesar Clown, Biyo, Konbu, Sind, Doran, Uzu, Mocha, Usopp, Nami (in Sanji's body), Brownbeard (K.O), Vergo, Monet, Tashigi (in Smoker's body), Smoker (in Tashigi's body), Monkey D.

Episode 602,History's Worst Weapon of Mass Destruction! Shinokuni,30-Jun-13,"After Smiley swallows the oversized candy, the candy coat dissolves revealing a special drug designed to convert the entire content of Smiley's body into a ""perfect"" weapon of destruction, Shinokuni. In the process, Smiley dies and in a sack of apples, an apple turns into a Devil Fruit. The beast's body transforms into poison gas spreading quickly throughout the island. Its lethal power is demonstrated when Caesar's men are caught in it, being petrified before the eyes of the brokers and the captive Straw Hat Pirates.
Zoro's team are seen desperately trying to outrun the approaching gas while Nami and Usopp help Brownbeard after their vicious attack by Caesar. At the lab, Caesar reveals to his captives that they will get to experience the poison gas as well, moving them outside dangling in a cave. In spite of their situation, Law tells Luffy that their original plan will still carry on and that it is time to strike back at Caesar.","Caesar is happy that Smiley ate the candy as instructed. He then calls for Smiley to be reborn as the people in the cell look on nervously. Bubbles begin to come off of Smiley as it chases the Straw Hats, Kin'emon, and Caesar's subordinates. The subordinates are panicking while Sanji observes that the candy triggered some kind of chemical reaction within the slime. Kin'emon remarks he does not have a good feeling about the whole thing and Zoro agrees. On the now broken sled is a bag of apples, one of the apples in the bag begins to change its appearance with swirls appearing on it and turning blue, turning into a Devil Fruit. Caesar then tells Smiley that they shall meet again, and orders Shinokuni to come to life. Smiley then explodes, causing it to emit a high pressure cloud of toxic gas. The gas quickly catches up with the fleeing pirates and subordinates. Catching one of them, the satyr becomes completely encased, stopping in mid-run. The rest of the satyrs get afraid looking what it did to the one affected, and accelerate while Caesar celebrates the total success of his weapon, saying he will not allow any of the subordinates back in the lab. He explains that the gas hardens on contact with people, making it so they cannot move, and causing an instant numbing effect. Smoker and the other prisoners watch in stunned silence as the screen showing the men's terrible fate, as do the underworld brokers.
Outside the lab, the G-5 Marines watch the broadcast and realize that what they saw on the screen is happening on the very island they find themselves. They realize the only reason the lab is blocked is because it is the only safe place on the island. They then shout angrily for Caesar to let them in. Zoro, Sanji, Brook, and Kin'emon are barely managing to stay ahead of the gas. Brook points out that some animal is ahead of them. It is the dragon that was pulling the now destroyed sled. Sanji does not believe it but Zoro tells him they do exist on the island, and wonders if they could escape by riding on its back, an idea which Brook likes.
Back in the lab, Luffy spots his friends on the screen. Robin wonders why they are there and how they are able to run the way they are. Franky tells her that that is not the best question to ask right now. Luffy calls to his friends that the gas is dangerous, telling them to run, but is cut off by the weakening effects of the seastone, preventing him from raising his voice. Caesar commends Luffy's friends for their toughness, but tells him it is all in vain since soon the island will be a place where nothing can exist, a shinokuni, and the only people able to survive are inside the lab. Just then the cage begins to tip backward. Caesar boasts that a pirate with a 400,000,000 bounty, a Marine vice admiral, and a Shichibukai could not stop him.
Chopper is watching the cage tip backward from behind, or rather in front, of a door, worrying about what he should do. Just then, a small piece of paper hits him in the head. He uncrumples it and sees the words ""do not do anything"", and wonders who threw it.
The cage, revealed to be attached to a crane outside, is now outside the facility dangling over the crowd by the door. The Marines outside call out to Smoker and Tashigi, terrified that everyone was captured. The soldiers begin begging for their lives, and Smoker tells Tashigi to tell them about Vergo. The situation is such that even Luffy admits that they have a problem. Overlooking the destroyed lab building, Franky commends the lab and how well built it is, with Robin remarking how the rubble would be a good source of raw materials. Law tells Luffy that they cannot be bothered right now. The current plan is to act on the old one, only to do it right this time. Law then declares that they are going to fight back.","Smiley, Pike, Caesar Clown, Monet, Vergo, Tashigi (in Smoker's body), Smoker (in Tashigi's body), Monkey D.

Episode 603,The Counterattack Begins! Luffy and Law's Great Escape,7-Jul-13,"As the Underworld Brokers watch the video feed of the captive Straw Hats and Marines, Eustass Kid and Killer decided to ignore it for more important matters, such as forming an alliance between the Kid Pirates, On Air Pirates and the Hawkins Pirates.
Law decides to set his plan in motion and orders Franky to blow a fireball at a destroyed ship, creating enough smoke to block the cage from being seen from outside. Law then breaks free, explaining that he switched the seastone chains with fakes during his stay on the island, and proceeds to free the others. Law restores Tashigi and Smoker in their own bodies while securing their aid. Franky, however, leaves them to protect the Thousand Sunny. Meanwhile, Zoro and Nami's group are still running away from Shinokuni and manage to join up while escaping. Luffy's group manage to enter the lab with the aid of Law and open the gate, allowing the G-5 Marines to get in before closing the gate, but the rest of the Straw Hats are still outside. Seeing their only chance of hope closing, Zoro and Kin'emon effortlessly cut the gate open, getting everyone inside safely. ","In the New World, a broker is left stunned at how Caesar Clown was able to capture the Shichibukai Trafalgar Law, the captain of the once again active Straw Hat Pirates, the ""Devil Child"" Nico Robin, and the great Vice Admiral Smoker. Also watching the broadcast, Killer tries to point them out to Eustass Kid, only for his captain to comment in an amused manner about Luffy's return. He then tells Killer that watching is meaningless, and how he does not think Killer ought to work as a broker anyway. Kid also mentions he is surprised about how Law was really was planning something all along, having believed he had become a government dog. Asking if the people had arrived yet, Killer tells him they have and that he was surprised they came at all. Before entering the room, Killer reminds Kid to be friendly, causing the captain to become irritated and tells Killer to shut up. Opening the door, it is revealed that inside are Scratchmen Apoo and Basil Hawkins. Apoo, standing amongst a wrecked room and over one of Kid's badly beaten subordinates, tells Kid that it feels nostalgic for him to see his ugly face. Kid instantly becomes enraged, asking what gave him the right to trash someone's hideout. Apoo replies that when he gets invited by the enemy, he comes expecting a fight and that he had suspected there might be a sniper somewhere. As the two challenge each other, Hawkins declares how foolish the meeting is and that he is leaving. Killer asks him to wait as he steps between Kid and Apoo, reminding them that the three crews came together to try and form an alliance and asks that they at least try to discuss it.
On Punk Hazard, Luffy is curious about Law's idea. Below their cage, the Marines continue to panic about the oncoming gas and call out to their superiors to help them. Asking if anyone in the cage can burn things, Luffy tells Law that Franky can, mentioning he can even shoot a laser beam. Replying that he requires both his hands to use his Radical Beam, Franky instead tells them that he can only use Coup de Boo right now. Law asks him to burn the battleship, which he does so immediately using Franky Fireball. From inside, Caesar watches this and wonders what they are doing, calling them desperate while commenting on their corpses being useful later. Outside, the smoke from the burning ship begins to surround the cage obscuring the view of any onlookers. Taking his chance, Law removes his chains explaining that they needed the smokescreen to hide the fact that they are escaping.
Luffy asks how Law could take off Seastone chains so easily, only for Law to continue explaining and mention that they were normal chains that he put in the lab so he could escape in case he was captured. Law then cuts the pirates free, and wonders aloud what he should do with Smoker and Tashigi as he puts them back in their own bodies. Tashigi realizes that her breasts are exposed and tries to hide them with her knees, begging Law to let her out of the chains. Law tells Smoker he has no reason to save him, but if Vergo loses his position due to Smoker returning alive, that would be good. He tells Smoker he will only free him on the condition that he forget everything he learned about him and Joker. On a balcony below the cage, Luffy calls out to Law about how they can get inside. Surprised, Law worriedly asks how Luffy broke out, with Franky telling him the mesh is not made of seastone. Yelling at Luffy to not do anything on his own, they then escape the cage.
Meanwhile, Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Brook, and Kin'emon are seen still barely outrunning the approaching gas. Commenting on the comedic way they are running, Kin'emon notes that it is not helping them. Sanji begins to then trail behind due to Nami's body being at its limit, and instinctively clutches his hurting chest, only to grab onto Nami's breast. Realizing this, Sanji is immediately invigorated and shoots ahead of the group, catches up with the dragon and captures it. Nearby, Nami and Usopp are riding on Brownbeard, with Nami apologizing to him for making him carry them in his injured state. Still concerned about the children, she can only hope that they had not eaten the candy yet. Reassuring her that it is not a big deal, Brownbeard states that he has to save his men anyway. They then notice a running figure in the distance, realizing it was the dragon outrunning the gas with several people holding onto it. In front of the lab, the Marines are relieved to see one of the shutters to the lab opening, while inside Caesar's subordinates are panicking due to the shutter opening, asking who had pulled the lever. Someone points up and the subordinates see Luffy, Robin, Law, Tashigi, and Smoker standing over them, a pile of defeated minions under their feet. Tashigi is happy to see everyone inside safely while Law wonders where his heart might be. Luffy remarks how interesting things are getting, and Smoker voices his reluctance about cooperating.
Outside of the lab, Brownbeard, with the dragon now attached to his tail and Zoro, Brook, Sanji, and Kin'emon clinging to the dragon, is running toward the now closing shutter. Zoro asks Kin'emon if he can cut iron and the samurai replies that it is no problem. Zoro then tells Brownbeard to keep running. The two swordsmen cut down the door and Brownbeard barrels through, all of them landing in a heap. Everyone inside is terrified now that the gas can get in the lab, while Luffy is happy to see that everyone is in one place again, and orders everyone to start fighting back.","Trafalgar Law, Monkey D.

The Pirate Alliance's Great Advance!,14-Jul-13,"Although the Straw Hat Pirates and Brownbeard were able to successfully make it inside the laboratory, they left a large gaping hole in the side of it, allowing the Shinokuni gas to flow in freely. This prompts the G-5 to frantically seal up the hole as the Shinokuni continues to spread throughout the island. 
The G-5 marines then turn their guns and swords towards the Straw Hats, preparing to arrest them. Suddenly, Law appears to tell them that the only safe route off the island is in a passage called R-66 found only in Building R. The marines are initially reluctant, but quickly change their mind when Smoker repeats the order to them. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of the men and rescue the children as he goes off to face Vergo. Prior to Luffy going off to fight Caesar again, Zoro calls out to Luffy reminding him that this is the beginning of the New World and must not let his guard down again, to which Luffy happily complies as he plows through the Satyr soldiers.
Caesar Clown then receives the news that the Straw Hats and Marines have broken into the Lab, leaving him alarmed and shocked at their escape.","Though the Straw Hat Pirates and Brownbeard (along with the dragon) managed to escape into the laboratory, they left a large gaping hole on the side of it. They soon realize that Shinokuni will be able enter the lab in such conditions, prompting the G-5 marines to frantically seal the hole back up with various wooden and metal planks. They succeed in sealing the hole up as Shinokuni proceeds to spread throughout the island. Brook uses the power of his Devil Fruit to become a soul and survey the area outside of the lab, noting that ""it was like the land of the dead"" and ""one step outside would kill you"".
After regaining their senses, the G-5 marines then turn their guns and swords towards the Straw Hats, preparing to arrest them. Nami notices Law and demands that he switch herself and Sanji back to normal, to which Sanji secretly refuses. Law agrees to return them to their original bodies, using Shambles to switch their hearts back. Nami notices that she originally had a different coat on, and immediately punches Sanji, accusing him for peeping at her body. Law then explains to everyone present that they only have two hours to escape, and then continues by saying the only passage that leads safely out of the island is called R-66 and is found in Building R. The Marines are initially reluctant, but quickly change their minds when Smoker repeats the order to them. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of the men and rescue the children as he goes to confront Vergo.
Meanwhile, Caesar Clown is celebrating the deaths of his victims, but notices that the cage has no solidified bodies, which he needs to prove the power of Shinokuni. He also notices the absence of the G-5 Marines outside of the lab. Vergo concludes that Luffy and the others must have broken out of the cage and helped the G-5 soldiers escape.
Before Luffy goes to fight Caesar again, Zoro calls out to Luffy and reminds him that this is just the beginning of the New World and he must not let his guard down again, to which Luffy happily complies as he plows through the Satyr soldiers using Gomu Gomu no UFO.

Episode 605,Tashigi's Tears - G-5's Desperate Breakthrough Plan,21-Jul-13,"Caesar Clown, incensed with the humiliation that his prisoners escaped and are inside his lab, orders the passage between building A and B to be closed and Shinokuni to be let in to kill the intruders. Vergo, however decided to take care of them himself. Chopper, who was eavesdropping snuck out and tries to find his way to the children within the labyrinth that is the lab.
Luffy, Smoker and Law were the first to cross the gate before the alarm sounded, indicating the gate is beginning to close. Tashigi instead heard the alarm and quickly ordered the G-5 marines to let the Straw Hats go and hurry towards the closing gate. When a wall was blown up in building A, Shinokuni flows in petrifying some marines while the rest hasten their escape. The Straw Hats and most of the marines got through the gate safety but a few stayed behind to help Tashigi across before the gate closes, losing themselves to the poison gas while their captain watches in horror.
Caesar, angered that they survived, promised that no one will escape this lab alive.","Watching the broadcast of his experiment, Caesar Clown comments that there is now no place left on Punk Hazard where anything can survive. However, he notices the lack of the G-5 Marines in front of the building and notices that he cannot see the Straw Hats, Smoker, and Law in the cage. Monet, also watching, asks Vergo's opinion, and he says that since they cannot see anyone in the cage, they must have escaped. He adds that he may have to kill Law himself because he is troublesome to let wander around. Caesar asks if they escaped, but just then, one of his subordinates enters and informs the group that the Marines and pirates have broken into the A building lobby and are moving forward. Caesar is stunned that they managed to escape and open the shutter, but his subordinate says that they are probably planning to escape through the internal exit. Chopper, seizing the opportunity, ducks out of the room and runs down the hall, saying that he found out how the drug was made and that he found a sedative. As Chopper wonders where to go, Monet seems to notice his departure but does not react.
Caesar, meanwhile, asks where his men are, and is told that most of them are in building B, getting ready to fight. Caesar hatches a plan to block the passage between buildings A and B, isolating A, then destroying the wall, letting Shinokuni in, and killing them all. Caesar's subordinate's panics, saying that some of their men are still in the building, but Caesar does not care. He also tells his subordinate to place a Den Den Mushi near the event so that he can show the brokers the effectiveness of the weapon. Vergo tells Caesar that if Smoker and Law escape, he will also be in trouble. Because of this, he plans to take out the group himself. Vergo wonders where his sword is, but Monet tells him that he is not a swordsman. Vergo, remembering this, heads out.
Inside building A, Luffy encounters the guard to building B, ""Machete"" Run and promptly defeats him with a Gear 2-enhanced kick. As Luffy fights his way through the guards, he notices a large metal door between buildings A and B closing. Smoker, having just arrived, notices the beeping and asks Law what it means. Law tells him that the doors are starting to close and that Caesar is looking to trap them in building A. Near the front of the building, the G-5 Marines stand in front of the Straw Hat Pirates, Kin'emon, and Brownbeard. Having no patience for this, Brook, Zoro, and Kin'emon hack their way through and are followed by the rest of the group and Vegapunk's dragon. The Marines continue their assault, but Zoro attacks back, only to be blocked by Tashigi. Tashigi tells the Marines that this is not the time to fight, and that they should focus on getting to the next building. Seeing the door starting to close, the Marines pick up the pace, carrying the wounded as they go. Caesar's troops notice Brownbeard carrying the Straw Hats and wonder if he betrayed them as everyone rushes to escape the building.
Outside the lab, a cannon is fired that blows apart the wall of building A, allowing the poisonous gas to seep in. The Straw Hats barely escape with their lives, and Tashigi is thrown in by her own troops. Tashigi tries to run back, but the gate is already closing, leaving some Marines petrified by the gas. However, these Marines pose in stances encouraging their allies to keep going. Caesar, seeing that they have survived, states that he will not let anyone escape.","Caesar Clown, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 606,The Treacherous Vice Admiral! 'Demon Bamboo' Vergo,28-Jul-13,"Though most of the G-5 marines got through the gate safely, they were attacked by the small dragon who after a while flew away in fear. The marines cheered as their beloved Vice Admiral Vergo shows up but that turned to horror when he brutally assaulted them. Tashigi tries to defend them from him, but was viciously struck down. That action was enough to cause Sanji to come to the rescue, claiming he heard her tears falling.
The Straw Hats (minus Sanji) and Brownbeard are still heading towards the end of the passage until the small dragon shows up and begins to attack them while Brownbeard suggests that he keeps running.
Chopper manages to run into Mocha who was still hallucinating and manages to defeat the soldiers trying to apprehend her and give her a sedative to calm her down. Chopper then pleaded for her help to prevent the other children from eating the drugged candy.
Meanwhile, Luffy and Smoker are racing towards building C where they believe Caesar and Vergo are located. They entered the private room where Caesar was angrily ordering Monet to release the poison gas on the marines only to turn around in shock of seeing Luffy fist buried in his stomach, who declared that he won't let Caesar escape again. ","The Straw Hats and Kin'emon are all escaping on Brownbeard, who is complaining about having to carry all of them, saying they should run unless they are injured. The riders give petty excuses as to why they cannot run, and Brownbeard does not believe any of them.
Close behind them, Tashigi is still saddened by the loss of some of her troops and in shock about how all the activity going on under the Marines' noses, but a soldier tells her they have to keep moving and she agrees. The soldiers next notices something coming from the roof. They then turn and run as the dragon that came in with the pirates breathes a large amount of fire down on them. The soldiers wonder what it is, and Tashigi tells them she heard rumors about there being dragons on punk hazard. She explains that Vegapunk made the dragons artificially to serve as guards of the facility. The dragon darts from wall to wall, descending on the Marines and dodging their bullets. It opens its jaws right in front of one of the soldiers who dives for cover at the last second, sending the dragon's head into the pipes on the wall. The dragon then turns its head around to show it eating the metal from the pipes. The Marines are terrified by the hostile reptile and continue to run towards building B. The dragon then buzzes low over them before continuing ahead of them. A soldier comments that it looked panicked and concludes that something is going on in front of them.
The Marines in front of Tashigi start cheering, saying reinforcements have arrived. Vergo has entered the passage from the other side. The soldiers are overjoyed to see their commanding officer, and ask if headquarters was informed of the situation and about the size of the reinforcement party. Tashigi is the only one not celebrating. Tashigi can barely make enough sound to tell them to run before multiple soldiers fall in front of Vergo. As a Marine falls over, Vergo's index finger is shown with fresh blood dripping from it. A soldier asks Vergo why he is attacking, saying that even as a form of punishment, using Shigan will kill them.
Tashigi remembers when she and Smoker were first transferred to the G-5 base. Vergo was telling them how the soldiers are rowdy and not too bright, but were overall good people. In between flashes of Vergo taking out more troops, Tashigi remembers a soldier telling her about how Vergo sometimes leaves suddenly to go home and care for his sick sister. She also remembers talking to him about a kidnapping case where Vergo told her it was a false claim, and that the parents were in denial and overreacting about the death of their child, saying that the idea of kidnapping gives them hope that their child is still alive, saying Tashigi would understand when she became a parent. Back to the present, Tashigi charges at Vergo with her sword. Vergo blocks the sword with his arm and then grabs her by the head. He then delivers a devastating close range punch that knocks her to the ground and almost unconscious. A soldier yells at Vergo, calling him an impostor, saying the real Vice Admiral Vergo would never do this. The remaining soldiers all gang up and attack Vergo, but Vergo annihilates all of them so he is the only one left standing. Tashigi, in her mind, prays for Smoker's help. Vergo then hears someone and a person is seen bounding around the corridor. Before Vergo can react, Sanji delivers a flaming kick to Vergo's head. The soldiers that are still conscious are surprised to see one of the pirates. Sanji said he heard the sound of a woman in trouble and came to help.
Back with Brownbeard and his passengers, Usopp asks why Sanji left so suddenly. Zoro tells him he felt an unfamiliar presence. Brook and Kin'emon look up and see the dragon from earlier. Nami notes that it looks different, something about its eyes are strange. Brownbeard exclaims that the sedatives have worn off and it is no longer docile.
The scene changes to Luffy and Smoker who are heading to Caesar's lab, taking the shortest route. Inside the lab, Caesar is watching the events unfold, irritated that Vergo took out his test subjects. He orders Monet to block the passage B gate and let the gas in. She tells him that Vergo is still there. Clown says he does not care. Smoker and Luffy arrive at the door to the lab, Luffy out of breath from running. They both tell each other not to interfere. Luffy is fighting Caesar, and Smoker is fighting Vergo. Smoker rings the doorbell, and the door opens, revealing only Caesar in the lab. Luffy delivers a blindingly fast and powerful punch to Caesar's stomach, saying he will not get away this time.","Nico Robin, Brook, Kin'emon, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Nami, Brownbeard, Sanji, Tashigi, Pike, Gal, Jero, Bakezo (flashback), Vergo, Smoker, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Sanji faces off Vergo while the passage between buildings A and B is closing and the previous one is opening, letting the poison gas enter.
During the fight with Caesar, he tries to drain the oxygen in the area to kill Luffy, but fails once he enters Gear Second and use some attacks with Haki, making the scientist angry to the point of using some techniques as oxygen-made sword and fire bursts.
Meanwhile, both Sanji and Vergo start running away from the gas. During this fight, Trafalgar Law makes his way to building D, where the SAD is made and Monet decides to enter the fight to protect Caesar, while he flies away, and reveals her snow abilities.","As Caesar reels from the punch, Smoker remembers that before Law freed him, he ordered Smoker not to touch Caesar since he still has his heart. Smoker leaves to go find Vergo. As Luffy begins the second round of their battle, Caesar demands to know why Luffy is trying to capture him which he explains is part of Law's plan. Caesar admonishes him, warning Law cannot be trusted but Luffy retorts that's for him to decide. The two fight with Luffy landing a few solid hits. Caesar tries to suck the oxygen out of him but Luffy manages to get out of range of the powers and attack from a distance. Caesar reveals he has other methods of attack such as a flaming sword. Luffy manages to avoid him and prepares to finish him with a Jet Gatling. However Monet uses some kind of power to make a wall and protect Caesar. On her suggestion, Caesar abandons the battle and leaves to try to locate Law, though promises he has a way to make guinea pigs out of Luffy and his friends. Luffy tries to go after him but Monet gets in his way, claiming ""Joker"" (Doflamingo) will kill her if something happens to Caesar, prompting Luffy to question Doflamingo's motivations.
At the passage connecting the A and B Buildings, Sanji and Vergo begin fighting, with Sanji landing a ""Flange Strike"" sending Vergo hurtling into a wall. Seemingly unfazed by the kick Vergo prepares for a counter, and Sanji remarks on Vergo ""hardening like steel"". Vergo attacks with one of his left kicks fracturing Sanji's right leg while Sanji blocks. Vergo attacks with another left kick as Sanji narrowly ducks, avoiding the blow. As the two continue, Sanji yells for the Marines to run away to the B Building as the room begins to go into lockdown and the gas is let in from the A Building.
An emergency broadcast is heard from the D Building that Law has invaded the SAD production room much to the dismay of Caesar and Vergo, with the latter stating this was what Law was after ever since he became a Shichibukai and that whatever he is planning will make a mess of the New World.","Monkey D.

Episode 608,The Mastermind in the Shadows! Doflamingo Moves!,18-Aug-13,"Law walks into the SAD Room. The door closes on Section A and it turns out Sanji is still alive. Tashigi tells the marines that the Vergo who attacked them is fake so that they could proceed with the mission. Vergo speaks with Doflamingo about Law while Baby 5 attacks him. Doflamingo stops her from attacking him.
Monet shows off her powers to Luffy. Chopper keeps the drugged children busy so that Mocha can run off to stop the drug. The rest of the Straw Hats are busy escaping section B. Kin'emon and Brook cut down the dragon. A little girl tells the two hazmat suit men that Momonosuke entered the secret room and turned into a dragon.","Law walks into the SAD production room, looks up at the giant tank, and smiles. Meanwhile, the Marines are crushed that the shutter closed, trapping Sanji and Vergo in with the gas. Someone tries to make an announcement about Law over the PA system, but the Marines are distracted as Sanji has appeared above them carrying two unconscious Marine soldiers. Sanji is happy to see Tashigi and tells the other soldiers to shut up, saying he only likes it when girls cheer for him. He takes a step and winces in pain. A Marine asks if he hurt his leg, and Sanji tells him he only takes sympathy from women, but realizes it could have been worse if he had continued fighting Vergo. Sanji asks what happened to Vergo, as he suddenly took off. The Marines say that the man Sanji fought was an impostor and the real Vergo would never do something like that. They look to Tashigi for confirmation, and she gives an empty agreement.
Vergo is inside block B, moving quickly using Geppo. He is talking on a baby Den Den Mushi with someone, telling him that Law is after the SAD and how he has betrayed them. The person on the other end laughs, and the scene changes to Dressrosa, where Doflamingo is laughing, saying that he thought of Law as a little brother and watched over him, calling the whole thing a shame.
Doflamingo continues the conversation as a nearby window is destroyed. An angry and visibly upset woman is suddenly in front of him, her left arm a cannon that she is pointing at the Shichibukai. Doflamingo takes no notice and tells Vergo that the first thing he would do if he were Law, would be to destroy the SAD production room. An explosion then occurs, completely enveloping Doflamingo.
He is seen lying in the rubble, his legs straight up in the air, still talking to Vergo as if nothing happened, saying that he would kidnap, or rather kill Caesar Clown, the man Law and the Straw Hats want to kidnap. This irritates the woman, who attacks Doflamingo with a scythe from her right arm as he dodges by leaning to the left and mentions that Caesar is the only one in the world who knows how to produce SAD. A man in a top hat and leather mask sitting nearby pulls out a pistol and casually shoots the woman who is trying to assault Doflamingo, who goes on to say that killing Caesar would be detrimental. A rotund, bearded man, wearing sunglasses and a unitard leans over the injured woman, whom he addresses as Baby 5, saying that slaughter that piece of scum where he stands. She angrily says that she will not forgive him this time and Doflamingo mentions that a series of misfortunes will occur. An old woman playing cards nearby asks Doflamingo what he will do about Law. The old man she is playing with says the choice should be obvious, as Law has turned traitor. Doflamingo orders Vergo to kill Law, with absolutely no mercy to the point that Law will wish he was never born. He then leans back slightly to dodge an axe from Baby 5. Vergo asks if he should take a photo of Law's body with the camera he bought in Dressrosa. Doflamingo tells him he never bought a camera, and Vergo says he will just cut off an ear as Doflamingo stops Baby 5 with his ability.
Doflamingo then addresses Caesar and Monet. He warns them to watch out for Luffy, saying he has Haoshoku Haki and his potential might be greater than Law's. He goes on to say that he has a woman with him who is just a little too hot-blooded at the moment, and he is sending Baby 5 and Buffalo over to help them. Lastly, Doflamingo tells them that when they are done with the current situation, they all are return to Dressrosa immediately.
Back in block B, Kin'emon and most of the Straw Hats are riding Brownbeard. Zoro comments how the little dragon is a lot more troublesome than the bigger one he fought earlier. Brownbeard panics, saying that since the whole area is on fire, the tanks full of hazardous chemicals could explode, which would destroy the walls and let the deadly gas in. Kin'emon becomes empowered, saying he cannot allow that dragon to exist. Brook then says that he will kill it, saying he cannot forgive the creature, no matter what. He remembered when the dragon was about to bite him, but then turned away looking disappointed. Usopp tells Brook there is no part of him the dragon could eat. Brook angrily fires back that bones have nutritional value too.
Brook and Kin'emon then get into an argument over who will kill the dragon. While they are arguing, Nami is waving her hands, praying for the dragon to ""fall for it"". Brownbeard asks what she is doing, and Nami tells him she is doing a samurai impression, but Usopp corrects her saying she means ninja. The dragon flies in between three clouds and gets electrocuted in Nami's Thunder Trap. Kin'emon is surprised that the ""breast band lady"" can use ninjutsu, much to Nami's annoyance. Usopp then uses Green Star Rafflesia, causing the dragon to crash into it and be momentarily stunned. Robin then uses Quarento Fleur: Quatro Mano Hold to clip the dragon's wings. Kin'emon is surprised that the tengu (Usopp) and the escort (Robin) can also use ninjutsu, confusing all of their weapons and abilities for ninja techniques.
As the dragon falls, it unleashes a breath of fire down on the group. Kin'emon jumps in front of Brook, calling him Sir Corpse, and cuts the flames with his sword. Brook and Kin'emon then use Gavotte Bond en Avant and Flaming Slash, respectively, at the same time on the dragon, effectively defeating it. Brook was then momentarily bothered by being called a corpse before remembering he is one. Everyone celebrates their victory as Brook and Kin'emon continue to stomp on the unconscious dragon. Brook then asks Kin'emon why he hates dragons, saying the samurai acted almost as if it were an act of revenge. Kin'emon tells him that revenge is pretty close. They then run after Brownbeard, realizing they were left behind. Nami then points up to a balcony above them. They see Chopper in Monster Point, fending off the giant children.
Nearby, in the second floor checkup room, a guard in a hazmat suit says a little girl is ok to go back to Biscuits Room and have her candy. She then asks where ""that other kid"" went, confusing the two men in the room. She says that a kid named Momonosuke went into the forbidden secret room and turned into a small dragon.","Trafalgar Law, Sanji, Tashigi, Vergo, Smoker (flashback), Machvise, Donquixote Doflamingo, Little Girl, Baby 5, Gladius, Giolla (shadowed), Lao G (shadowed), Monet, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Luffy faces Monet off and almost dies in the battle, due to having his body frozen, but recovers and counters with Haki. The counter attack, however, made a hole in the floor, leading to the garbage room, where Luffy fell to, and Monet gives farewell to him, as ""he can only escape flying"".
Trafalgar Law prepares to attack the SAD Room, but is confronted by Vergo, who gives critical punches with his Haki-powered fists and bamboo. In the biscuit room, Monet prevents Mocha from fleeing with the candy, and the Straw Hats (except for Luffy and Sanji) also help Mocha. After almost killing Law, Vergo is confronted by Vice-Admiral Smoker, who prepares to fight the other Vice-Admiral.","In the research room, the guard is shocked when hearing that a kid turned into a dragon and asks the little girl where she saw it and she says she peeked into the Secret Room and kept it to herself and is now worried for Momonosuke. The guard lies saying he is fine and that she does not need to worry about him and that he is eating and tells the little girl she must not tell anyone else what she saw.
In Caesar's lab, Luffy asks what Monet is doing and she makes a ten layer snow hut. Monet passes through the snow huts to see Luffy and asks how does it feel that ten layers of snow huts can not be easily broken. Luffy just says she is stalling for time and he will just break it in a jiffy and tells her to stop wasting his time. He says she can not beat him and she agrees stating she could not achieve victory in a fight with him, but tells him to not confuse victory with fighting ability. She then hugs him with her wings and Luffy notes how cold she is and her body are like ice and tells her to get off. Monet refuses stating he can no longer escape her hold and the coldness will sap away his strength and Luffy begins to become drowsy. She then points out that there is a bunch of snow build up around them and Luffy should lose consciousness soon and asks if it feels good. She tells him to just close his eyes slowly and relax, but Luffy manages to fight it off and use a Jet Spear to break free by breaking the ground. As Luffy begins to laugh, he ends up falling down below from destroying the floor. Monet comments on his hidden potential and tells him that falling from their location will have him end up in the ducts and into the garbage can deep inside the earth. She adds that unless he can fly he won't ever get out and just comments to herself about how he just dug his own grave and says her farewells to him.
In front of the Biscuits Room, Chopper in his Monster Point continues to hold off the children telling them that he knows it's painful but they must endure it and not take any more candy, knowing that they want to go home. He tells them he won't let them get into the Biscuits Room. Chopper accidentally hurts a kid while holding him and he apologizes. However, the other children attack Chopper violently with pipes, calling him a monster and stating that this has nothing to do with him and they want the candy, stating it is theirs. Chopper tells himself it's no use stating unless he fights back he can't stop them. As Chopper falls over the kids note an opening and run to the Biscuits Room and Chopper tries to stop them only for the Rumble Ball to wear off and him turn back to normal. They all rush to the room with the intent to get candy and start trampling Chopper and he can't move and luckily is saved by Nami as the other Straw Hat Pirates and Kin'emon arrive as Nami and Usopp ask what is happening while Kin'emon shouts out his son's name. Chopper starts tearing up glad they came stating that Caesar is trying to make them into big violent fighters and he can't lay a finger on them and says they have to find a way to stop them. As they make their way to the Biscuits Room, Robin uses her Mil Fleur: Gigantes Mano and makes giant hands to stop the children. Chopper then tells Nami about the girl, Mocha, who is trying to help him and says she's in danger and is protecting the candy in the room now. Usopp notes this is bad and they won't stop at nothing to get that candy now.
The kids say the hands are annoying and start attacking and biting Robin's hands causing her to let go stating they are so violent and she can't stop them. The kids see Mocha and tell her to hand over the candy. Mocha, having regained her sanity tells them to not eat it saying it's evil candy telling them to snap out of it that Chopper is trying to help them. She states if they don't listen they won't be able to go home and Chopper says it's useless and tells her to run. She starts running and the kids tell her to not eat the candy on her own and then she sees the exit closed with Monet in the front and asks her to help. Monet tells Mocha she can't keep the candy all to herself and should share with the rest. As Zoro notices her, he asks who she is and Usopp points out she's the bird woman he saw before.
In the SAD Production room, Law is seen bleeding and breathing heavily fighting Vergo. He uses Shambles to get his heart back and at the moment he does Vergo appears in front of him and delivers a powerful kick to the face and sends Law back to the iron bars behind him and he spits out blood. Vergo catches Law's heart and starts squeezing it causing Law to scream out in pain. Law manages to stand up with difficulty and Vergo hardens his arm and starts brutally punching Law over and over again causing Law's hat to fly off and Law manages to grab Vergo and use Counter Shock on him sending a large electrical surge in his body, but the attack did little damage. Vergo easily recovers and delivers' Joker's message of ""what a shame"" to Law and Law just smirks back at Vergo as he had calculated how to retrieve his heart back from Caesar and that Vergo is his only miscalculation. Vergo says Law should call him Vergo-san and retorts to squeezing Law's heart even tighter, causing Law to scream in agony as Vergo tortures him. Vergo then mentions how he's in the middle of something and 'he' just had to show up, referring to Smoker who just arrived, and says it doesn't matter what it takes, he plans to seal Smoker's lips permanently. As Law seems to have lost consciousness, Smoker responds that it'd be better to end things quickly to dispose of trash looking down on him and calls Vergo pirate Vergo.

Caesar Clown, sitting on the second floor of R-block with his subordinates (Vegapunk's old room), instructs that the doors to C and D-blocks be closed, driving everyone to the first floor of R-block where a trap is ready to expose them to Shinokuni. When one of Caesar's subordinates questions the nature of the gas, Caesar then makes a speech to his subordinates, saying that the poisonous gas bomb four years ago was Vegapunk's doing and that Caesar tried to stop him. However, in a flashback it is revealed that Caesar constructed the weapon himself, and when he was told to stop and banished from the science squad, he set it off.
While the gates to C and D-blocks are closed, Luffy meets a small dragon who can talk.","Smoker comments that the room is very disturbing. Vergo tells him not to worry about it. Smoker tells Vergo he is not looking forward to telling the troops about their commanding officer's betrayal, since Vergo is deeply admired by his subordinates. Vergo tells Smoker he will not have to worry about his men. Smoker, angered by this, attacks Vergo with his jitte, asking what he did to the soldiers. Vergo blocks this attack with his bamboo cane. Vergo then teases Smoker for having compassion toward his subordinates, but tells him that since the truth is out, Smoker will have to die. Vergo's cane expands in the middle, and something shoots out of it like a blowgun. The shot causes a huge explosion. Smoker avoided the attack by becoming intangible and tries to attack Vergo from behind. Vergo leans back and narrowly avoids getting hit. He then tries to kick Smoker, but Smoker blocks it with his foot. He swings his cane but Smoker dodges it and moves around to Vergo's exposed side. Smoker then lands a devastating punch to Vergo's face, sending the vice admiral flying back and landing in a heap. Smoker tells Vergo that his tenure with the troops does not matter, because as base captain, Smoker is in charge of them when they leave the base, and challenges Vergo to try and harm any more of his troops.
In building B, Sanji and Tashigi are rushing through, having just gotten to the area the dragon set ablaze. Tashigi is confused by Sanji's behavior and desire to protect her, since they are supposed to be enemies. Sanji tells her that pirates are free spirits open to everyone. As the Marines are complimenting him for stopping the ""fake"" Vergo, one of the tanks in the room explodes, damaging the wall, and making a hole to allow Shinokuni in. Another tank explodes on the other side of the room, causing the same result. The injured soldiers, as well as the soldiers carrying them, fall victim to the gas. Tashigi can not believe that it would happen in a room as spacious as the one they are in. Sanji tells her to run as he runs toward the gas. She tries to argue, but Sanji just tells her to go.
In a secret room on the second floor of section R, Caesar Clown is watching these events on a monitor, pleased that the dragon's rampage let the gas in, and satisfied that his demonstration will be a success. He tells a subordinate to close the gates to sections C and D. When asked by a subordinate about section R, Caesar tells him the plan is to lead the pirates and soldiers into the corridor and then flood it with gas from C and D, leaving them with nowhere to run. He goes on to say how he does not like the room he is in, but he really had no choice in the matter. There is a huge group of subordinates in front of him, and they ask why he is in Vegapunk's old room, considering the grudge he has against him. One of the subordinates says that Vegapunk is just as much an enemy as the ones outside, since he caused the incident four years ago. Caesar tells them they are vital to his forces and does not want any collateral damage, causing all of them to become emotional. He then goes over his plan.
Once the shutters to sections C and D are closed, all areas will be closed off, leaving section R the only possible path. That way, all his enemies will be in the same place at once. The ventilation shaft in that room is connected to the outside, so letting the gas in will be easy, and will leave them with nowhere to run. Their deaths will then be broadcasted to the brokers. One of his subordinates asks if Caesar created the gas since it looks exactly like the gas from Vegapunk's failed experiment four years ago. Caesar begins to shed tears, saying the war going on in science makes his heart ache. He tells them that he tried to stop Vegapunk from doing the experiment, since it would be dangerous for the people on the island. The accident happened anyway, and Vegapunk is still haled as the best scientist in the world. He asks if it is right for someone who caused so much pain to hold that title. His subordinates are deeply moved. Caesar tells them that he made the gas against his better judgment to prove that he is the best scientist in the world. He ends his diatribe by saying that once he is acknowledged by the Marines, he will be able to use his scientific genius for the good of the world. Moved by his emotional speech, his subordinates begin to cheer.
Caesar giggles as he flashes back to what really happened on that day four years ago. He was being ordered to cease the experiment, since it would be bad for the people on the island, contradicting what he told his subordinates. Caesar snaps back saying he is trying to make ways to kill pirates, but the Marines argue that they cannot hurt innocent civilians. Caesar laughs, calling them a necessary sacrifice, saying world peace is the calm that comes after the storm. He then calls Sengoku too soft, and reasoned that Akainu would want his weapon. He then laughs, saying he heard Vegapunk's human enlargement experiment failed again. He tells the Marines that the only way to do it is to kidnap children who are still growing and put them through various treatments. Later, he is yelling at Vegapunk, asking him what he is doing. Vegapunk tells him that they are relieving Caesar of his post in the research team. His actions have become too reckless. Caesar yells not to mess with him, and slams a button on a console, causing the lab to explode in a huge mushroom cloud.
The gates connecting area B to areas C and D have now been shut. In the basement, Luffy asks something if it just spoke. Luffy is staring at a dragon and asks what it is. The dragon responds by asking Luffy who he is.","Usopp, Brook, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Roronoa Zoro, Kin'emon, Nico Robin, Biyo, Doran, Mocha, Monet, Sind, Konbu, Smoker, Vergo, Trafalgar Law, Sanji, Tashigi, Caesar Clown, Monkey D.

Episode 611,A Small Dragon! Momonosuke Appears,8-Sep-13,"Luffy meets Momonosuke in the garbage dump of Block C. In a flashback, Momonosuke didn't want the candy Caesar gave out to the children and he got hungry so he ate a devil fruit which turned him into a dragon. Luffy and Momonosuke take off.
Kin'emon, Usopp, and Brook look for sea stone handcuffs. Smoker continues his fight with Vergo. Nami, Robin, Zoro, and Chopper are going after the children. Robin gets stabbed by Monet in the arm and Zoro defends the Straw Hats against Monet. ","In the scrap heap beneath C Building, the small dragon introduces himself to Luffy as Momonosuke. Luffy thinks that he has heard the name before, but Momonosuke yells at him for drooling. Momonosuke continues, stating that he is not food and would rather eat than be eaten. Luffy grabs Momonosuke's horns, looking for a person stuck to his neck communicating by farts, but soon realizes that Momonosuke (which Luffy thinks is an eel) is the one talking. Momonosuke chides Luffy for drooling, but his own stomach then rumbles. Luffy says that Momonosuke is just as hungry as he is, but the dragon says that a warrior does not go hungry from just ten days without food. Luffy is stunned that he has been without food for ten days, and when Momonosuke asks his name, Luffy introduces himself and says that he is going to be the next Pirate King. Momonosuke is surprised, as he had thought that pirates were hulking brutes, unlike Luffy. Momonosuke remarks that Luffy is also an outsider, and says that the facility is for diseased children.
Momonosuke says that he does not know much about the island, and arrived merely when he sneaked onto a boat. Momonosuke says that even though he distanced himself from the other children, they were nice to him, offering him candy. The children met Caesar Clown, and when asked his name, Momonosuke refused to give one. After declining candy for some time, he managed to escape, hungry and exhausted. He found a Devil Fruit and ate it, but was caught by one of the children. She tells him that they are not allowed to be in that room, but Momonosuke says that he needs to escape the facility. The girl says that they all want to go home, but that being in the Biscuit Room is not all bad. Suddenly, some of Caesar's men arrive, and the girl runs away. Momonosuke, however, transforms into a dragon before their eyes and to his confusion. He manages to escape, and after he is gone, the soldiers remark that the fruit that Momonosuke ate was Vegapunk's failed artificial Devil Fruit.
To wrap up his story, Momonosuke tells Luffy that he is human. Luffy says that he ate a Devil Fruit, and asks Momonosuke why he does not simply transform back into a human. Momonosuke is surprised that he can turn back, and asks Luffy how to do so. Luffy brushes off this question, saying that he is not a Zoan, and remarks that the hole he fell through is a long way away. Momonosuke says that he also wants to leave since he overheard Caesar saying that all of the children will be dead in five years if the experiment continues. Momonosuke continues, saying that he would have warned the children but instead fell into the hole, trapping himself. This infuriates Luffy, who says that he is going to climb the walls along with Momonosuke. The dragon is relieved, but Luffy tells him to get a hold of himself. This makes Momonosuke see a hallucination of Donquixote Doflamingo. This scares the dragon so much that he starts to fly, with Luffy hanging on to him.
Meanwhile, in B Building, Usopp, Brook, and Kin'emon have broken off from the rest of the group to look for Seastone handcuffs at Robin's request. Brook uses his Yomi Yomi no Mi abilities to look behind walls. Usopp is worried about Nami and the rest of the group because he is not there to protect them. However he feels that they will be fine because Zoro is with them.
In the SAD production room in D Building, Law looks on while Smoker and Vergo clash. In B Building, Tashigi and the G-5 Marines are fleeing the poisonous gas with help from Sanji, who is kicking them along.

Sanji and the marines see Monet and are admired by her beauty. Monet uses her devil fruit powers and bites off a shoulder of a few marines causing them to panic.

Monet recovers shortly after and attempts to attack Zoro but is defeated by Tashigi.","Sanji assures the G-5 men that, while he will not hurt women, Zoro is an entirely different story, and that Tashigi and he will be fine as they continue to look for the children. This boosts the Marines' morale that they will get praised by Tashigi, Nami, and Robin if they accomplish their goal.
Meanwhile, Zoro gets mad at Tashigi, claiming that she is getting in his way but Tashigi claims that, in addition to keep Monet from going after her subordinates, she is staying behind because Zoro will not cut a woman basing her assertion on their first duel back in Loguetown. Zoro denies it but claims since Tashigi wants to fight Monet, sits down and permits Tashigi to have the battle. Thinking she assumed Zoro's ""weakness"", Monet becomes conceited and attacks Tashigi with a barrage of snow attacks. She eventually manages to wound Tashigi with a bite to the shoulder. However, Tashigi endures it because she knows she will lose her arm if she pulls back.
Just when Monet is about to finish her, Zoro cuts Monet on the cheek with Armament Haki causing her to let go of Tashigi. He chides Tashigi for being too slow as he approaches Monet menacingly. Admitting that there are things he would rather not cut, he then asks if she has ever met a wild animal that promises not to bite. Monet realizes he actually is going to attack her, but is paralyzed with fear because of this. Zoro cuts her in half but does not use Haki, thus she survives thanks to her Logia intangibility. He then asks if the two women are satisfied. However, Monet is still too terrified to pull herself back together properly.

Vergo covers up any information about that island and anything that happens there - the SAD production is run by Donquixote Doflamingo, and SAD produces SMILE, an artificial Zoan Devil Fruit. One of the Four Emperors, Kaidou, is forming an army of people who have eaten these artificial fruits.

Sanji, Nami and Robin as well as the G-5 marines and the now sober children are rushing together towards Building R. Zoro and Tashigi are far behind because of Zoro's bad sense of direction.

In the SAD room, Vergo was berating Smoker for using his smoke form against him who is more than capable of handling devil fruit users, and uses his Haki imbued Bamboo stick to injure Smoker, destroying his jutte. However, Smoker was really just distracting Vergo in order to allow Trafalgar Law to regain his heart. With Trafalgar Law's heart back where it belongs, Law is ready to finish his fight. Smoker, who was barely conscious tells Law to finish it quick because it shames him to be indebted to a pirate. Law then calls out to ""Joker"" who was monitoring the battle with a Den-Den Mushi, and tells him that once Vergo is defeated and Caesar captured, all the SAD at his disposal will be gone and he will lose his position as king of the underground. Doflamingo then laughs, replying that Law's fear of Vergo when he becomes very angry is still there, and that his Haki protects his whole body so that not even Law's power can hope to cut him. Law then proves Doflamingo wrong by cutting a Haki-armored Vergo in half, along with the SAD chamber and the mountain it was built in. Law then states that Whitebeard only ended the last era and that the marines never challenged any of the big name pirates recently because they were preparing a new battle force and that the war at Marineford was really just a prelude to something else. Law continues by saying that, like Doflamingo had said, a new unstoppable wave always marks the beginning of a ""new era of great ones"", and that he had broken the gears of the cycle so no one, not even Doflamingo can turn them back.","Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Caesar Clown realizes his plan is falling apart, and becomes increasingly enraged. He orders his men in the secret room to open the air vents, letting Shinokuni flood the room, and when they argue that there are over a hundred men under Caesar's command left in the room that will be killed, he snaps at them, referring to them as guinea pigs and scum, and that since nobody cares he can keep killing and replacing them as many times as he wants. His remaining minions are shocked into silence by this, to the extent that the ones previously fighting Usopp outright ignore him while he steps back to hide.
Caesar's puzzled reaction to their shock convinces some of his men that he is bluffing, and did not actually intend to hurt them, and, believing it to be a complex strategy, open the vents as ordered. As the gas fills the room, Caesar sucks it into himself, and begins to grow huge, before taking on a more demonic form. Gloating about his new found might, he promptly murders all of his men remaining in the room as a show of strength, enraging Luffy.

Usopp then interrupts, asking if he can use the control panel to help his friends and allies escape.

Usopp counters that Luffy would find things easier if he did, but that was not in his nature. As he speaks, Luffy, still enraged, stops and turns around to face Caesar again. As Usopp continues to talk about Luffy's positive characteristics, his captain continues by blowing air into both his arms, expanding both of them to activate Gear 3. He then begins to charge back down the corridor towards Caesar, both his arms stretching out behind him. Usopp states that Caesar is the type of person Luffy hates the most, and that Luffy won't forgive him.

Buffalo, the giant man she is riding on, says it is Doflamingo's way of being protective like a big brother. He goes on to say that she needs to learn to say ""no"" more often. She has a flashback to a sloppy-looking man giving her a flower, calling it love at first sight and asking her to marry him. Baby 5 tells Buffalo that no one can say no to a marriage proposal. Buffalo tells her she gets attached too easily, citing the fact that she reads fifty different newspapers, is too quick to give out money, and is just as quick to spend it. He asks her how much debt she is in. Baby 5 responds that she only owes 98,000,000 and tells Buffalo to drop the issue, instead Buffalo asks to borrow another 2,000,000. He tells her he wants to go to the casino when they return. Baby 5 tells him he can have it as soon as they finish the mission. As she says this, Punk Hazard appears below them.
Baby 5 wonders if the gas will go away if she fires one of her weapons. Buffalo tells her to jump off and that he will take care of it. She does so and he uses his rotating abilities to act as a fan and dispel the gas, calling it Squall Matasaburo. Dispelling the gas uncovers the tanker ship, and they decide to wait there for Monet, Caesar, and Vergo when all of a sudden, the tanker explodes. At first they thought it blew up, but then they realize something hit it. They are even more surprised when that something turned out to be Caesar Clown. Buffalo calls Doflamingo to report it. Doflamingo is surprised at first, but then smiles. He orders Buffalo to recover Caesar and return to Dressrosa immediately. Buffalo wonders about Monet and Vergo, but Baby 5 tells him Joker must have his reasons. Doflamingo is laughing under his breath, saying that with Caesar again in his custody, he can continue to make SAD. While going to collect Caesar, Baby 5 sees someone on the deck of the tanker. Buffalo tells her anyone surviving the gas was an impossibility. To their surprise, the robotic Iron Pirate General Franky emerges from the rubble instead, and looks curiously at the ""bird"" heading toward him.","Monkey D.

Episode 619,Running Wild! Invincible General Franky,3-Nov-13,"Franky begins to attack the two Donquixote Pirates who retaliate with Baby 5 turning into various weapons, which Buffalo launches at their foe. Caesar Clown regains consciousness and, after realizing his defeat, remembers he still possesses Smoker's heart and prepares to stab it. Inside Room R, the Straw Hat Pirates and everyone else are waiting for their comrades to return with Mocha, before riding the transport cart out of the collapsing building. The missing members manage to reach the group at the same time. Usopp, also, returns with the Sea Stone handcuffs and the former subordinates of Caesar Clown. Momonosuke, however, is shockingly alarmed to see his father petrified.
In Dressrosa, Doflamingo sends his farewells to Vergo and Monet, who survived her encounter with Tashigi and Zoro. Doflamingo then asks Monet to activate the island's self destruction mechanism, but Monet told him that she is already about to do that. With the island's destruction in her hands, Monet says her goodbyes as she reaches for the switch. Moments later, a massive explosion rocks the entire mountain base.","Doflamingo sent Baby 5 and Buffalo to retrieve Caesar. Franky (inside the General Franky) caught sight of the two. Baby 5 mistakes the General Franky for a Pacifista. As Baby 5 and Buffalo approach the robot, Franky fires bullets at them. Baby 5 replies by using her machine gun. The shooting creates a cloud around the General Franky that leads Baby 5 into believing that the robot was destroyed. However, when the dust cloud fades, the robot is revealed to be perfectly unharmed.
Because of that, she has no choice but to use the powers of her devil fruit. She first turns into a knife, but is easily matched by Franky's sword. Later, she turned into a missile, which hits and damages the General Franky and the rear part of the SAD Tanker. The fate of the General Franky remains unknown from then on. Meanwhile in a point near the SAD Tanker, Caesar gains consciousness and grabs out, what he believes to be, Smoker’s heart and prepares to stab it.
The Straw Hats and everybody else are waiting for the rest of their crew mates. While they are waiting, the crew notices that the gate starts to close. It is because the Shinokuni is just about a few hundred meters from Gate R-66.  The Straw Hats are asked to board the transport cart, but Luffy replies that they won’t board the cart unless Chopper and Brook come in. Finally, Chopper and Brook show up running away from the gas. Brook along with Kin'emon's petrified body comes in first, followed by Chopper, Mocha and the G-5 medical team.
The Straw Hats were happy to reunite with them once again. Meanwhile, Usopp was given several Sea Stone handcuffs by Caesar’s henchmen though he only needed one. Meanwhile, Momonosuke sees his father’s petrified body and is shocked. Everybody climbs on the transport cart to escape the building and find Franky to complete the crew.
Doflamingo (in Dressrosa) calls Vergo for his final message. Doflamingo thanks Vergo for his service in the Donquixote Pirates. Meanwhile, Monet calls Doflamingo for one last time. She is asked by her captain to activate a self-destruct button in the building, similar to the one that destroyed the other two labs around four years ago. After Monet's call from Doflamingo, she made an artificial snowfall to clear her mind from distractions while executing the order. The episode ends with Monet pressing the island's self destruct button that causes a huge explosion in the mountain base.","Franky, Buffalo, Baby 5, Trafalgar Law, Biyo, Doran, Smoker, Tashigi, Monkey D.

Episode 620,A Critical Situation! Punk Hazard Explodes,10-Nov-13,"Monet was moments away from activating the self destruct button when she felt her heart being stabbed and collapsed. At the same time, Caesar Clown is shown stabbing the heart, believing it to be Smoker's. The Straw Hat Pirates and their allies are still racing towards the exit of the collapsing lab when they feel the explosion of the SAD room and then see Shinokuni on their trail. Smoker, seeing that they nearly reached safety, questions Trafalgar Law about how he possessed his heart the whole time. Trafalgar Law reveals the clever deception he played on the mad scientist, when he returned the heart of Monet to Caesar without Caesar being the wiser.
At the tanker, Baby 5's missile attack failed to take down Franky Shogun and their duel begins anew. Buffalo contacts Doflamingo to explain the situation. After confirming that the island wasn't destroyed as intended, Doflamingo decides to tend to the matter himself and is seen somehow flying over the sea towards Punk Hazard.","After Baby 5's attack, Franky Shogun is seen lying on the deck surrounded by flames. Baby 5 reforms through her ability after her Missile Girl attack. Buffalo asks if she needs some weapons he picked up, although comments how she is already a weapon herself. Baby 5 says that they are blessed but the weapons were bought because she felt ""needed"", due to her personality. Franky Shogun punches her from behind but she jumps out of the way and transforms into a revolver. Frank takes the full blast but laughs it off, condescendingly saying that it would not work.
On the tanker, Caesar realizes that Baby 5 and Buffalo are there to save him while still holding Smoker's heart.
In the SAD production room, Vergo is seen talking to Doflamingo through a Den Den Mushi, where the latter apologizes to the vice admiral for what is to come. He tells Vergo that he was his longest companion and thanks him for his hard work and devotion. Even in pieces, Vergo smiles.
In the SAD transport corridor, Momonosuke is still in shock and in grief over his father's state. Brook mistakes him for an eel. The group then hears an explosion, which Law says came from the SAD production room. Rocks begin to fall down from the ceiling. Law tells them that the corridor is a tunnel built into the mountain and if it were to collapse, all the occupants would be buried alive. Coincidentally, the way in front of them is blocked. However, Zoro simply clears the path with ease.
Monet is still in building C, ready to set off the deadly gas explosion with the button. A series of frames shows scenes such as the children crying, Sanji kicking away a rock and Doflamingo sitting in his room at Dressrosa. Monet says goodbye in her mind to the Shichibukai, saying that he will be the next Pirate King.
Caesar then prepares to kill Smoker, using a sharp object to pierce his heart. He laughs and says ""Die, Smoker!"" However, Smoker is shown to be perfectly fine while Monet collapses with blood flowing out of her mouth. She pulls up her top to reveal a cube-shaped hole in her chest, which is out of view. Doflamingo realizes something is wrong and orders her to answer him, but Monet collapses from being stabbed in the heart by Caesar.
On the cart, the children urge it to move forward. Smoker asks Law why Caesar thought he had Smoker's heart. Law has a flashback to the moment when Caesar outlines the bonds of their contract - Law must give his heart and Caesar would give Monet's heart to him. After fighting Smoker, Law had two hearts in his hands, Smoker's and Monet's. Unknown to Caesar, Law had returned Monet's heart. He explains this to Smoker, saying that Caesar simply misunderstood and Law ""kindly gave back the heart of the secretary, Monet"". He underlines this action with his belief that those who do good will get good things in return. Law then calmly asks if anyone can produce wind as there would be gas in the air when they exit. The Marines are surprised, claiming that no one has such an ability. However, Nami tells them that she can, leaving the Marines even more surprised. Someone else shouts that the exit is coming up.
Doflamingo sees that he can no longer contact Monet though the Den Den Mushi connection is still active. He then confirms with Buffalo that Punk Hazard has not been blown up according to plan. Enraged, he changes into his feather coat, opens a window, and leaps out.
On Dressrosa, a young girl is seen looking for Doflamingo. She asks an old man about his whereabouts, who replies that he should be on the fourth floor. The girl says that he was not, and the window was wide open. The old man seems calm but dark as he is states that he has no idea and that he went alone again.
Somewhere over the sea, Doflamingo is running in midair. He is talking to Baby 5 and Buffalo, who are telling him that they are having a problem with a metal guard. Doflamingo seems uninterested, telling them to finish it off and noting that there was no big explosion. Doflamingo then states that he is coming to Punk Hazard.","Monet, Sind, Konbu, Brownbeard, Monkey D.

Episode 621,Capture Caesar - General Cannon Blasts,17-Nov-13,"Franky in his Shogun puts up a good fight against the two subordinates of Doflamingo and he sends them flying away with a portable version of the Thousand Sunny's Gaon Cannon, but the two refuse to stay defeated despite their injuries.
The fight however was interrupted with the arrival of the mine cart filled with all of the lab escapees. Seeing that Law has allied with the enemy and that the odds are against them, Buffalo and Baby 5 decide to hightail out of Punk Hazard, with Caesar Clown in their possession. Before Law could stop them, Luffy stops him, saying that Usopp and Nami will handle this. The two Straw Hats prove Luffy right, as they easily stop the fleeing pirates and succeed in capturing Caesar.
Meanwhile, far away from Punk Hazard, Doflamingo is still flying toward Punk Hazard imagining what torture he would inflict on the brats, while elsewhere on a giant penguin, a mysterious man is wondering which direction leads to Punk Hazard.","Buffalo is surprised by how strong the Franky Shogun is. He then charges at Franky, saying that no one has ever been able to dodge the next attack. Using his powers, he spins Baby 5 on one of his chains, who in turn uses Sickle Girl, and then slams her into Franky Shogun's left arm, impaling it. Franky laughs and says he will give them credit, but only for breaking through the robot's armor, and compares the pair to a praying mantis taking on a warship. He then grabs Baby 5 and yanks on the chain, causing Buffalo to lose his balance and hurl forward. He then declares that the Gaon Cannon has set foot on land, and shoots them with Franky Shogun's most powerful attack, General Cannon. As Buffalo and Baby 5 are reeling from the attack, they wonder why someone like this would try to impede them taking Caesar. Franky then looks down from the tanker and sees Caesar lying there, and wonders how the scientist got there. Buffalo stands up, declaring that he is not going down that easily, saying that such a defeat would drag Joker's name through the mud. Baby 5 then declares that they will be taking Caesar with them, no matter what it takes. Franky then asks them if he is correct in concluding that they want Caesar.
Back in R-66, the exit is in sight. Usopp begs Nami to conjure up some wind, so they will not die. Everyone cheers as they exit. Franky is happy to see that everyone made it out. Baby 5 and Buffalo are seen surprised by their sudden arrival. Luffy, Usopp, Chopper, and the rest of the boys in the cart are very excited to see the robot, while Nami, Robin, Tashigi, and the rest of the girls are visibly unimpressed. Law is surprised to see Buffalo and Baby 5, who asks him if he is really going to defy Joker, who has been saving the heart seat for him. Luffy asks if those two are Law's friends, and Law tells him no. Realizing their sudden disadvantage, Buffalo and Baby 5 grab Caesar and start to fly away. Usopp tells everyone to leave the escaping pair to him. Law is about to use his powers and tries to argue, but Luffy cuts him off, telling him that Usopp has things under control, and Zoro tells him not to underestimate Usopp. Law argues, saying that if they get away, the plan will be ruined. Nami cuts him off again, saying that if they are going to have an alliance, then Law needs to trust them more, adding that she needs to do a little fighting after doing nothing but running. Usopp and Nami then declare that they will take care of the far away enemies with their backs turned, and Zoro tells them to hurry up. Usopp then orders his Bakun Grass to grow into his Kuro Kabuto, which then starts eating the nearby rubble and twisted metal. Buffalo tells Baby 5 to watch the rear, since he cannot while flying. While Baby 5 vows to defend them with her life, a giant weather egg, called Lightning-chan by Nami, flies over them and releases a huge storm cloud. Baby 5 looks at the cloud worriedly while Nami declares they will not get away. She then attacks them with Thunder Breed Tempo, landing a direct hit. 
As they start falling, Buffalo calls to Baby 5 and realizes she is unconscious. Usopp then attacks them with Killer Shooting Star Rush, shooting several pieces of stone from the rubble at them. Caesar tells Buffalo that, since he cannot move, he must protect him and Buffalo declares that he will complete a mission for the Donquixote family as they are pelted with rubble. As the two go down, Caesar manages to stay airborne as the shots pass through him. He then decides he will go to Dressrosa by himself. Usopp tells him that escaping is useless, since the last shot was seastone handcuffs. The cuffs catch Caesar around the neck. Everyone cheers as Usopp proudly declares that he will fight anyone whose back is turned. As the three fall into the ocean, Law declares the first step of his plan is complete and Luffy asks Law what he thought about his crew's abilities.

Episode 622,A Touching Reunion! Momonosuke and Kin'emon,24-Nov-13,"The Straw Hat Pirates and the Marines are about to enjoy a large dish prepared by Sanji, though the Marines are still adamant in keeping themselves from being friends with pirates. While the stove is being constructed, many events occurred; Kin'emon was actually alive the whole time, Law removed the drug from the children, Momonosuke's human form is revealed, Nami complied to Tashigi's plea to let her take care of the children, Mocha has recovered fully from the drug overdose and the poison gas is revealed to be lethal after a full day's effect.
While the group celebrates their victory, Smoker talks with Law about him manipulating Luffy, but Law says that its the other way around. Previously, during their encounter in the mountains, Law revealed his goal to defeat Kaidou with Luffy's help, but Luffy expressed his desire to defeat all of the Four Emperors.","The Marines draw a line to separate themselves from the pirates, saying they could have the tanker, but warning them not to cross the line. Smoker asks the soldiers why they went that far, since the order was just not to mingle with them. The soldier responds that they must be thorough, while another makes an exception for the medical squad. Smoker tells them that he got through to the G-5 base, and a ship is on its way. Luffy is talking with Brownbeard, who has opted to turn himself in since the Marines would cure him of the poisons and other chemicals Caesar Clown put into his body. Luffy says it is too bad, since they had just become friends. The Marines yell at Luffy for crossing the line they made, and Luffy tells them they just made up that rule while next to him. Meanwhile, Sanji and Brook are laying bricks for a barbecue pit. Brownbeard goes on to say that he no longer has any comrades, and that being in jail is better than being Caesar's guinea pig. 
Just then, Chopper shouts accuses Law to be a murderer. Franky tells him to stop, almost dropping the mast he is lifting. He then continues to help the Marines repair the tanker's damaged mast. He adds that they should have told him that the tanker was important so he could have moved his fight from earlier away from it and not have to repair it like he is now. Chopper tells Luffy to stop him, continuing to yell about a murderer, saying he means Law. Brook is also shouting, much to the annoyance of Luffy and Sanji. Brook tells them that he broke Kin'emon, feeling remorse despite the samurai already being dead. Kin'emon's shell begins to crack, revealing the samurai inside. Luffy, Sanji, and Brook all scream at him in shock, and Kin'emon screams right back at them. Sanji kicks him angrily, asking how he could possibly be alive. When Brook calls Sanji's actions uncalled for, the chef responds that the samurai deserved for not being dead like he was supposed to be. Father and son are reunited at last, with Momonosuke jumping into his father's arms. Luffy is somewhat surprised to see the boy, and not the dragon he had come to know. For whatever reason, Momonosuke is missing his clothes, but is soon given an outfit much like his father's as well as a proper introduction as a child from Wano Country. Shortly after their reunion, Momonosuke faints, apparently from starvation. 
Chopper is yelling for Law to come outside, demanding to know what he was doing with the children in the infirmary. Law tells him to mind his own business, as he is now finished with taking them to pieces. This answer frightens Chopper to no end, and he runs into the infirmary, with Law adding that he had to methodically treat them for all the chemicals they were exposed to. Inside the infirmary, Chopper is met with enthusiastic greetings from all the children. They tell him that the man in the fluffy hat (Law) took all of the drugs and chemicals from their bodies and they are all completely cured. They said that being in pieces was cool but scary. The only one who has not woken up yet it Mocha. As the facts start falling into place, the children realize their ""master"" was a bad person and that Mocha was partly responsible for saving them. One child says his memory of the events is still fuzzy, but that Mocha collapsed after coughing up blood. Another child asks if Mocha will be alright. Chopper reassures her that Mocha will be fine and everyone will be going home. They then ask to see Nami, calling her the orange lady, remembering her initial promise to save them. Just as they say this, a woman comes through the doorway. It is revealed to be Tashigi, and she tells the children that they are now under the protection and supervision of the Marines, much to their disappointment. They also ask to see the robot (Franky) and rubber man (Luffy).
Outside, Usopp is catching a whiff of what Sanji is cooking, and is looking forward to eating. He then turns to Nami and asks her if she was the one who asked the Marines to take care of the children. She tells him yes. As a pirate, she says that saving people is not her strong suit. Usopp agrees, saying they would just get charged with kidnapping anyway. Nami agrees, remembering Tashigi tearfully asking her to leave the children in her care, and adds that she is terrible at dealing with female Marines, as Tashigi is seen trying to write down the names of several disgruntled children. Nami goes on to say that she can't deal with female Marines because she feels too safe around them, since they remind her of her mother, Usopp remembering that her mother was a Marine. She adds that being looked after by a strong Marine woman is the best thing for them and Usopp agrees. Nami calls him a pushover and Usopp says she is one to talk.
Sanji has just finished preparing a huge pot of sea pork stew, one of the 99 recipes of Newkama Kenpo. He pours a bowl and serves it to Momonosuke; having heard that the boy had not eaten in days. Sanji advises him to start slowly eating the stew, which is just one of the many dishes presented to him. However, Momonosuke's samurai pride gets the better of him, and he declares that he is not hungry. He is about to throw away the stew when Sanji grabs him by the collar, saying he will not forgive anyone who wastes food, even a child. They are interrupted by Kin'emon, who has started eating, visibly in awe by how good the food is. He tells Momonosuke it is safe to eat and to not be shy about it, saying the person who made it can be completely trusted and there is nothing to worry about. Momonosuke starts eating, tears pouring down his face as he does so. Luffy thinks the food tastes so good that it made Momonosuke cry, but Sanji tells him it is because of something else, and wonders what happened. Everyone, Marines, former henchmen, children, and Straw Hat Pirates alike, is now lined up to receive some of Sanji's cooking. Sanji asks what happened to the whole dividing line idea, and the soldiers tell him it is a ceasefire. Hearing this, Zoro asks a Marine to get some alcohol from the tanker, with a child asking for juice, and the soldier happily obligues. 
Law tells Luffy that they need to leave now, since someone could easily attack them if they mess around the way they are. Luffy tells him he understands, and then shouts ""Time to party!"", much to Law's confusion. Everyone enjoys themselves at the party. Luffy and Brook eat with the samurai, and are joined by some children. Zoro happily toasts with one of the Marines. Chopper is in tears now that Mocha woke up, and Robin is nearby having soup with one of the children. The children entertain themselves by talking with Nami, climbing on Tashigi, and watching Usopp demonstrate Franky's many features. Some soldiers approach Smoker and tell him they are going back in the island. When Smoker asks why, they tell him they got Caesar to tell them Shinokuni's weakness, and that their comrades can still be saved. Caesar, with pliers on his cheeks and tears in his eyes, is asking why Smoker is still alive. Further back from the festivities, Smoker and Law are talking. Smoker admits he never thought Law would keep his end of the deal, as Law could have killed him on several occasions but did not. He also comments on his plan to take advantage of the Straw Hats and start something with one of the Four Emperors. Law replies he wonders who the person really being taken advantage of is, and has a flashback to the conversation with Luffy. He is telling Luffy that they will be going after Kaidou. Luffy tells him it does not matter the order as long as Shanks isn't first, since he is going to bring them all down eventually.","Sanji, Brook, Smoker, Monkey D.

Episode 623,It's Time to Say Goodbye - Leaving Punk Hazard!,1-Dec-13,"In a flashback, Law tells Luffy not to underestimate the Four Emperors, as they once had even competed against Whitebeard for territory. Law tells him that with his plan, they have around a 30 percent chance of defeating Kaidou. Back to the present, the Straw Hats and G-5 Marines part ways. The Marines claim to hate pirates and the children are seen crying, unable to say goodbye to the Straw Hats, but the Marines reveal that they badmouth the crew because if they do not, they will come to love them.
Flying over the ocean, Doflamingo approaches a life raft with Baby 5 and Buffalo's heads hanging on it, which were apparently cut off by Law. They tell him that they have failed to obtain Caesar, to which Doflamingo replies it is alright since they were only obeying orders. Law's Den Den Mushi is seen on the raft, when it starts talking to Doflamingo. Law tells him that he needs to resign from the Shichibukai to get Caesar back or else Kaidou will wipe him out, infuriating Doflamingo.","Luffy, the crew, and the children are all having fun while Law and Smoker talk. Law thinks back to when their alliance was formed, and they agreed to target Kaidou of the Four Emperors first. When Luffy says he plans to defeat all of the Four Emperors, Law tells him not to take them lightly, and that the chances of their plan to defeat Kaidou succeeding are slim.
After the feast the Straw Hats are about to set sail and leave. While they are seeing the children off, the G-5 Marines start insulting them and they put up a barricade so the children cannot see them. The children are crying and are sad as they remember how the Straw Hats helped, and they want to say good-bye. The Marines continue to insult them and say that Pirates are evil and the Marines are justice. The children keep on crying until Tashigi reprimands her subordinates, telling them to stop insulting the pirates, but they say that if they stop they will start to like them and then they start crying as well. Tashigi starts to laugh. Law and the Straw Hats start to head to the Thousand Sunny, and Zoro asks why Law is going with them, and Usopp tells him that Luffy got them into more trouble.
Doflamingo is seen flying, but notes that the ""sky road"" has ended. He sees the life raft from his tanker, with Baby 5 and Buffalo's severed heads on it and a Den Den Mushi that resembles Law. Law tells him that they have Caesar and says that since he cannot produce SMILE anymore his business partner Kaidou will get angry and Doflamingo will be killed. Doflamingo tries to negotiate with Law, but Law says that there is only one thing he can do: resign from being a Shichibukai. Law says that if it is not in the paper by tomorrow morning he will not give back Caesar then hangs up. Doflamingo seethes with rage, and curses Law.","Franky, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

All a sudden, Doflamingo appears from the sky and throws Baby 5 and Buffalo's heads back on to their body. Before any of the G-5 soldiers could attack, Doflamingo uses Conqueror's Haki and knocks out a very large majority of them. Even then, the remaining soldier couldn't control themselves because of his devil fruit powers. Doflamingo even has some of the G-5 soldiers kill each other demanding the whereabouts of Law. Smoker steps into the fight, launching White Blow at Doflamingo. As the fight progressed, some G-5 soldiers decide to aid Smoker.

However, Doflamingo survives the attack but refuses to fight the former admiral. He then leaves with Buffalo and Baby 5 while asking ""what Kuzan really is"". Smoker is then treated by the G-5 Marines who ask whether Kuzan is now a boss of the underworld.
Meanwhile on the Thousand Sunny, Usopp and Chopper are paranoid about an attack from Doflamingo, and are wearing samurai armor created from Kin'emon's powers. Kin'emon is angry at Zoro because he believes that Zoro has defiled the famous samurai Ryuma's grave to obtain Shusui. Meanwhile, Momonosuke is playing cute to get attention from Nico Robin and Nami, making Brook, Kin'emon and Sanji jealous of him.
Meanwhile, someone out in the sea watches the ship intending on attacking it.","In spite of Kuzan's presence, Doflamingo attempts to kill Smoker but is frozen by Kuzan's Hie Hie no Mi ability. However he manages to break free as the ice hadn't reached his heart. Seeing nothing to gain from fighting Kuzan, Doflamingo decides to take his leave, but not before questioning Kuzan what he stands for due to rumors he had heard. Kuzan does not answer him and yells for a medic. Doflamingo collects Baby 5 and Buffalo and departs. Only then does Kuzan states that he never fully trusted the World Government, and believes that he can make a difference outside the Marines, hence why he is not enlisted in the Marines anymore. Smoker inquires about how he knew of Punk Hazard as one of the World Government's top secrets, worrying that Kuzan is involved with the criminal underworld.
The G-5 Marines, who were eavesdropping on the conversation, are yelled at by Kuzan, who asks them to clear off, now that they have treated Smoker. He then informs Smoker that he is doing nothing of the sort. He also warns Smoker to tell Sakazuki to keep an eye on Doflamingo as he poses the biggest threat to the Marines for now. For, even though Doflamingo's presence is not as obvious as the Kuja Pirates, his prowess as a pirate is quite exceptional. He tells Smoker to ask the Fleet Admiral to dispatch the Admirals as soon as possible. He also asks the G-5 marines not to reveal his presence there, to which they oblige.
Out on the sea, the crew is taking a breather. Usopp and Chopper worry furiously about Doflamingo coming to attack them. Kin'emon nearly gets into a duel with Zoro thinking he had robbed Ryuma's grave due to him having his sword, the Shusui, on him. Momonosuke is revealed to be taking a bath with Robin much to the envious anger of Sanji, Brook and Kin'emon.
When they confront Momonosuke over it, Nami punches all three for their supposed bullying. On being saved, he addresses Nami as a fair princess, which prompts Nami to hug him, much to the anger of the three perverts. Momonosuke rubs his face onto Nami's breasts on purpose, while grinning wickedly at the three. As the night goes on, most of the crew (Luffy, Zoro, Brook, Nami, Robin, Law and Momonosuke) sleep while others (Usopp, Chopper, Franky, Sanji, and Kin'emon) stay up looking after the Sunny.
Meanwhile, a mysterious individual in the sea watches the ship with the intent to steal Caesar Clown.","Kuzan, Donquixote Doflamingo, Smoker, Buffalo, Baby 5, Camel, Trafalgar Law, Monkey D.

The Pirate Alliance Makes a Sortie,22-Dec-13,"Smooth seas stretch out before the Straw Hats as they leave Punk Hazard far behind—but while they fear Doflamingo's return and prepare to face him, another foe lies in wait, whose powers could be their downfall!","The Thousand Sunny is still in the water as a massive sea creature arises from the waters, carrying Breed. As the rest of the ship's residents sleep, Usopp, Franky, and Chopper keep on the lookout for Doflamingo, when all of a sudden, Breed and his army of Sea Lapahns attack the Thousand Sunny and everyone on board. In response, the Straw Hats and everyone else begin fighting off the Sea Laphans when Breed suddenly calls off the attack, revealing himself atop the Thousand Sunny.
With Breed having kidnapped Caesar, Luffy attacks him, but he is stopped by a Kung Fu Dugong using a Armament Haki-infused fist. Breed escapes with Caesar, while Law tries to use his abilities to stop him. When Law tries to use Room, he is interrupted by Sea Lapahns rocking the boat. When everyone turns around, they see a massive ship the size of an island, with Sanji noticing a Jolly Roger resembling Breed. Law, Luffy and Chopper decide to board the Shark Submerge III to go after Breed.
As they leave, Chopper askes Luffy if he recognizes the Sea Lapahns, noting they look identical to the Lapahns back on Drum Island. Law asks Chopper if that's why he joined them, proceeding to call him a tanuki. Chopper begins yelling at Law, but Law notices the Sea Lapahns entering Breed's ship. The pirates step out of the Shark Submerge III and into Breed's ship, with Law warning Luffy to be careful. Just then, Luffy decides to yell to Law that it's not as dark where he is. Law, Luffy and Chopper head towards the middle of the ship, but they are suddenly attacked by Sea Laphans, an Octopus Boxer, and other sea creatures.
They successfully fight off the sea creatures when the Kung Fu Dugong from earlier arrives and attempts to attack Luffy. Luffy defeats the Dugong, when the Dugong remembers losing to Luffy in a fight while in the Arabasta Kingdom. Excited, he jumps towards Luffy and begins hugging him. Meanwhile, Caesar is seen locked in a cage with Seastone handcuffs. He asks if anyone can free him as Breed enters the room. Caesar recognizes him and asks if he can be set free to see Doflamingo. However, Breed just tells him to stop whining and calls him worthless scum, causing Caesar to realize that Breed is not working under Doflamingo. Breed explains his plan to make a kingdom full of pets and that he needs Caesar's help to do it. However, Caesar refuses to help Breed, and Breed uses his ability on the scientist.
Elsewhere, Luffy is catching up with his Kung Fu Dugong friend and training him. As leader of the Sea Animal Pirates, the Dugong apologizes to Luffy for attacking him and explains his journey since leaving Arabasta. He explains that after arriving in the New World, Breed enslaved his crew. Suddenly, Breed began speaking into the intercom, commanding them to fall in line. Panicked, the Dugong tells them to run away quickly.
When Breed arrives and scolds the Dugong for not listening to him, he sees the Straw Hats and Law and explains that he is a pirate. He attacks Chopper with a green substance that, upon hitting him, transforms into a collar. Breed then commands Chopper to attack Luffy and Law, and Chopper eats a Rumble Ball, transforming into Monster Point. Powered up, he attacks his former allies, distracting them and allowing Breed to collar them as well.","Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 629,Startling! The Big News Shakes Up the New World,19-Jan-14,"The world learns about Doflamingo's sudden resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy threatens Doflamingo through the Den Den Mushi to which the latter retaliates by stating he possesses something Luffy wants badly. During the breakfast, Law explains his plan for the destruction of the factory. Meanwhile, at a meeting at the Marine Headquarters, Buggy is revealed to have become a Warlord during the time-skip. In order to deal with Doflamingo, Luffy, and Law, Sakazuki dispatches Fujitora. At Dressrosa, during a meeting with the top members of the Donquixote Pirates, Doflamingo is shown to be in possession of Ace's former Devil Fruit, the Mera Mera no Mi.","The news of Doflamingo's resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea spreads quickly around the world. On one island, one man asks another if they had a weapons deal with the Donquixote Family. One of them is trying to call the family, but no one is answering at the other end. The first man proclaims that they need the weapons from him to put a war in their favor. Jewelry Bonney is seen reading about Luffy and Law's alliance, while eating a piece of pizza. Various people react to the news, assuming that the alliances will lead to no good, and that Doflamingo must have had his reasons for resigning. Among these readers is Jinbe.
At the Kid Pirates' base, the crew is reading the stories and wonder at how their alliance made the news. Someone asks who the journalist who reported the story, Absa, is. Apparently he had been getting huge news scoops all over the place lately. Kid says it does not matter how their alliance with the Hawkins Pirates got leaked. What bothers him is Luffy and Law teaming up. He correctly theorizes that Luffy and Law are also going after one of the Four Emperors, and wonders which one it is.
At Dressrosa, several Den Den Mushi are ringing off the hook. Doflamingo, however, is taking the call from Law and the Straw Hat Pirates. The Straw Hats are amazed he picked up, but are warned by Usopp to be quiet so he does not hear them. Luffy shouts his name into the receiver and declares he will be Pirate King, prompting a series of slaps from Usopp, but to no avail. Luffy continues, making sure he is correct in thinking that Doflamingo was Caesar's superior and that he was aware of what Caesar did to his subordinates and the children. He tells Doflamingo he will give Caesar back as per the deal, but begins to threaten Doflamingo if he does anything like that again and is about to finish when Doflamingo asks if it was two years since Ace's death.
He then remembers Luffy disappearing only to reappear two years later and asks what he has been up to. Luffy refuses to answer, but Doflamingo tells him he has been looking forward to meeting him. Doflamingo goes on to say that he has something that Luffy will most surely be interested in. Luffy instantly assumes Doflamingo is talking about meat and starts fantasizing as Law pushes his head away from the receiver, warning him not to get pulled into ""his pace"". He reclaims the conversation, asking Doflamingo not to go off on tangents, and saying he will get Caesar as agreed. Doflamingo reminds Law of what could happen if he gets tricked.
He then asks for confirmation that Caesar is alive and well. Law points the receiver toward Caesar as the bound scientist begins a tearful apology but is cut off as Law takes back the receiver. He tells Doflamingo that in eight hours they will deliver Caesar to the southeast shore of Green Bit, the deserted island just north of Dressrosa, and leave him there at 3 p.m., which is as far as Law is willing to go to accommodate Doflamingo. Doflamingo pretends to be hurt, saying he was looking forward to maybe having a drink and catching up with an old friend. Law responds by declaring their conversation over and hanging up.
Luffy remarks how he almost strayed from the objective, and Usopp remarks that Luffy's eyes (in the shape of meat) tell a different story. Sanji then realizes that they don't know how many men Doflamingo will bring. Law tells him that the number does not matter, and if everything goes according to plan, then Caesar will work as a successful decoy. Usopp understands Law's plan now. While Doflamingo is distracted, they will use that window to destroy the SMILE Factory. Law tells Usopp he is correct, but there is just one problem. He doesn't know where the factory is. Franky reassures him that the factory has to be massive and they should be able to see it easily, at which point he could just take care of it with his laser. This gets Usopp and Chopper excited. Law goes on to say that the difficulty in procuring intelligence was bothering him. Nami reasons that the factory is a high priority, so it could be that the information is top secret and not easily available.
Kin'emon asks that since Law mentioned Green Bit, whether or not they would be going to Dressrosa. Law assures him they will be arriving at Dressrosa. Luffy asks Law if he had ever been to Dressrosa. Law says no, since it is a country that Doflamingo controls entirely. Luffy gets excited, saying he smells another adventure nearing, and they will make a plan once they get there. He cannot wait to see what Dressrosa is like and hopes to go to Wano Country as well. Law asks him if he really thinks they could land without having a proper plan in place. Luffy asks Sanji what they are having for breakfast, and Sanji replies it is just sandwiches. Chopper asks for a cotton candy sandwich while Robin just asks for tea. Law tries to tell them that he does not like bread, but is shocked at how easily he was swept in by the crew's pace and ignored.
During the meal, Kin'emon starts telling the story behind why he went to Punk Hazard. He asks Law if he knew a place called Zou. Law is surprised, since that is where his crew is, and once the mission at Dressrosa was complete, he was planning on going to Zo. Kin'emon eagerly asks if he and Momonosuke could join them on their trip to Zo. Luffy wholeheartedly agrees, and decides they should go to Wano while they are at it. Law tries to interject, but Kin'emon continues his story. Kin'emon, Momonosuke, and two other samurai were on their way to Zo when they were shipwrecked. Kin'emon, Momonosuke, and one of the other samurai washed ashore on Dressrosa. Momonosuke continues, saying they were attacked the moment they landed in Dressrosa. They met some children on a ship who said they needed medical attention. Kin'emon got off the ship to help them, but it set sail right after that, trapping Momonosuke on board. Kin'emon proceeded to follow Momonosuke only because his comrade, Kanjuro, stayed behind to hold off the enemies. Kin'emon now vows he must return the favor and save Kanjuro. Franky and Chopper are deeply moved by Kin'emon's story and Luffy declares they will save him as well. Law yells at them not to get distracted.
The scene changes to the Marine Headquarters, where Commodore Brannew is giving a speech about how there must be seven Warlords, no more and no less, saying their loyalty and power is supposed to serve as a deterrent to other pirates. He lists off the current roster: The strongest swordsman in the world, Dracule ""Hawk-eyes"" Mihawk, the depraved king of Dressrosa, ""Heavenly Yaksha"" Donquixote Doflamingo, the human weapon, ""Tyrant"" Bartholomew Kuma, the empress of Amazon Lily, ""Pirate Empress"" Boa Hancock, the rookie behind the Rocky Port Incident, the ""Surgeon of Death"" Trafalgar Law, the leader of the Pirate Dispatch organization, the living legend ""Star Clown"" Buggy, and the mysterious one that he had mentioned earlier. That made seven people until the story broke that morning that Doflamingo had resigned. He adds that Law's position is in jeopardy as well depending on his intentions. Brannew goes on to say that the Warlords are supposed to be held in the same kind of esteem as the Marines and Four Emperors, but is cut off by Sakazuki, who tells Brannew that he has made his point. He asks if Brannew thinks Law and the Straw Hats can move freely, adding that Smoker filed his report yesterday, and that the matter will be cleared up within a day, saying that Fujitora has been dispatched to deal with them.
On Dressrosa, someone asks Doflamingo not to make hasty decisions. Baby 5 asks a little girl where Trebol is. The old woman playing cards wonders what Doflamingo is thinking, and another subordinate declares he is ready to fight if the Marines show up, while the old man replies that his orders are absolute. Baby 5 then spots Trebol high above on a tower, commenting on how funny everyone looks in pandemonium and wonders if the outside world is anything like what he is seeing. He comes down and asks Baby 5 if the rumors about her latest fiancé getting killed were true. Baby 5 tells him he is invading her personal space, and that there is a fine line between persistence and annoyance. Trebol then asks if she likes it when he is persistently annoying. Baby 5 tells him to shut up and that Doflamingo asked for him, adding that he should bring ""that"" with him, and reminds him again about personal space. He tells Baby 5 she needs to be more discrete in picking her men, and then asks her to marry him, adding that he was just joking. Baby 5 wonders if he actually needs her, prompting the two old people playing cards to tell her not to go there.
In another room, Doflamingo is praising Diamante for his supervision of the Colosseum. Diamante shrugs it off and says that Doflamingo's royal charisma is the real reason behind colosseum's success. Doflamingo insists it is all due to Diamante's know-how, and calls Diamante the savior. Diamante tries to rebuke this, and Doflamingo is about to agree this time, only for Diamante to change his mind and take all the credit. Trebol then drips down from the ceiling, saying he has the thing Doflamingo asked for. Doflamingo then reminds him about personal space before taking the box and telling Trebol to take a seat.
Doflamingo gives the box to Diamante, who tries to argue that he is unfit to hold the box until Doflamingo agrees with him again, at which point he changes his mind and takes it. Doflamingo opens the box and takes out a Devil Fruit, saying he really did have something that Luffy would be interested in, the Mera Mera no Mi, saying there is no way Luffy would let anyone have his brother's power.

There they divide into three groups: Luffy, Sanji, Zoro, Kin'emon, and Franky head into town; Momonosuke, Chopper, Nami, and Brook protect the Sunny; Law, Usopp, and Robin go deliver Caesar Clown. Group 1 go to a restaurant where they see an old man Zoro encounters earlier, gambling with a great amount of wealth. Some of Doflamingo's men start to take advantage of the old man's blindness and cheat him out of his money.","The Thousand Sunny docks at Dressrosa, in between boulders. Monkey D. Luffy strikes his characteristic pose, loudly declaring their arrival. Franky is eager to locate and destroy the SMILE Factory. Luffy tries to ride Momonosuke like earlier on Punk Hazard, but Momonosuke claims he does not know how to fly and cannot remember doing it. He says even if he could, he would never do such a dreadful thing while vaguely recalling a dark hand reaching out to him and someone asking him for his name. The pair proceed to fight over whether Momonosuke is a coward or not, in spite of his insistence that a samurai fears nothing. Luffy proclaims he does not care about samurai, and states that he is going to be Pirate King one day, while Momo bites his head and counters by saying he is going be a shogun of Wano Country one day. Brook sighs and reminds Luffy that he is fighting an 8-year-old. Kin'emon steps in and scolds his son, telling him to respect the man who saved his life. Kin'emon tells him that the samurai of Wano have high pride, but also tells Luffy to not be so caught up in arguing an 8-year-old, but the two continue to stick their tongues at each other. Kin'emon offers to provide disguises for everyone's time on the island. He claims the men all wear shirts and suits, while the women are all naked, which pleases Sanji and infuriates Nami.
Law gives Nami a Vivre Card that points towards Zou, in case something happens to them. Law shows the Straw Hat Pirates a map of Dressrosa that one of his crew members drew. The team handing Caesar Clown over to Donquixote Doflamingo will pass through Dressrosa and head north, over a long bridge, to Green Bit; apparently, one cannot get there by ship. Law, Usopp, and Robin (with Caesar) are the team heading to Green Bit. Meanwhile, Nami, Momo, Brook, and Chopper will look after the Sunny while the rest will head to destroy the factory.
As Sanji, Kin'emon, Franky, Zoro, and Luffy walk around the island, they witness the things for which Dressrosa is renowned: the beautiful fields of flowers, the scent of delicious food, the tireless, passionate dances of women and, to the entire group's stunned surprise, animate humanoid toys that live alongside the people. A doll-man has his arm torn off and stolen by a dog, while a tin soldier remarks that he recognizes the Straw Hats from the newspaper. The team then hears a scream as someone gets stabbed in the street Zoro asks if there is a slasher roaming the street, but a toy soldier explains that the women on the island are of such passion that they stab any man caught cheating on them, which stuns Luffy's team again.
The group is in the port town of Acacia. Kin'emon disguises them all in black suits, shirts, and fake beards as Luffy declares that it is time to eat. A blind man descends some stairs, walking towards the Straw Hats. Zoro places his hand by his side, ready to draw his sword, but the man simply asks for directions and moves on. At a restaurant, Sanji remarks that the city seems too calm for a nation whose king just resigned this morning. Luffy tries to ask someone nearby for info, but Sanji stops him, reminding him his face was on the newspaper just that morning. A toy monkey waiter brings the group's food and Sanji inquires about the name of his soup. The waiter tells them that the island has a legend about fairies, and that they have been sighted there for centuries.
The restaurant also has a casino, with tables across the room from the eating area. The blind man is on a winning streak at one of the roulette tables. Eventually a bunch of crooks come out and begin taking advantage of the blind man, telling him lies about the roulette results of the game, stating that the ball has landed on the wrong color. The punks state amongst themselves that with Buffalo absent from the bar, they can cheat as much as they please. The other customers are displeased, commenting on the dishonor done to Doflamingo's name by their actions. The blind man ultimately bets all of his chips.","Monkey D.

Before he leaves Luffy interrogates him about his identity to which, he replied that for their sake he should not reply. Following a moment of inattention Zoro's sword Shusui alongside others belongings are stolen by 'fairies'. Noticing the edge of the sword Zoro, Sanji and Kin'emon go after the thief. During the pursuit, Kin'emon is separated from the group.
While interrogating the leader of the thugs defeated earlier about the SMILE factory, Luffy and Franky are told about the Corrida Colosseum event. Luffy mistakes the grand prize for meat.

The news shocks Luffy.","After going ""all in"" in roulette, the thugs once again lie to the blind man about the results of the game, however this time Luffy reveals the actual result. The blind man ends up engaging in a battle with the thugs, ultimately leaving a massive hole in the floor of the restaurant with the thugs lying defeated within. Everyone wonders in awe about the blind man's powers. Sanji says he has an ability, and Zoro wonders what ability it is. As the blind man walks off, he offers to pay for the damages. The cashier thinks she recognizes the man, but before she can say more, the man excuses himself. Luffy asks the man what he is. The man tells him that it would be wise for both their sakes to not tell Luffy his identity. Sanji is confused about what the man meant by that, and wonders if the man has some degree of fame. Zoro agrees that he is no regular person.
Suddenly people start realizing that their possessions are gone. A bag, a watch, a jacket, and a wallet were all exclaimed to be stolen. The patrons realize that it must have happened when the old man kicked up dust earlier. Sanji wonders if the man robbed everyone. Zoro notices he is missing a sword, and to his horror, Kin'emon realizes that the missing sword is Shusui. A nearby puppet tells them that fairies took everyone's possessions. When Zoro asks if the fairies are a group of thieves, the puppet simply responds that fairies are fairies, and all one can do is laugh it off and move on. The invisible fairies have been the guardians of Dressrosa since the old days, and the people have no choice but to accept whatever they do. Zoro gets angry and tells the puppet it is not a joke, and Kin'emon agrees, saying it is Wano Country's national treasure. Zoro disagrees, saying it is his sword, and Kin'emon declares his intention to duel Zoro and take back Shusui for Wano Country. Zoro is not intimidated by this. Just then, Zoro notices something move. He looks at a window to see someone climbing out it with a bundle of items. Tied to that bundle, is Shusui. Zoro runs after the thief, Sanji follows Zoro so he does not get lost, and Kin'emon follows in turn, refusing to let Shusui get away. Luffy tries to run after them too, but is stopped by Franky. Franky tells Luffy he has a plan. Since they are dealing with lowlifes, Franky asks Luffy to let him take the lead.
They go outside with one of the thugs from the roulette table and start interrogating him. The subordinate tells them that he was ordered to track some samurai, but he has no idea where they are or if they were even captured. He also does not know anything about the SMILE Zoans either, or a factory of any kind. Luffy remarks how he knows nothing about his own crew. Franky then orders the man to tell him where his superiors are. He tells him that everyone is busy, but that they were all called to the coliseum, including himself. He tells them that there is a big event at Corrida Coliseum. The guy goes on to say that some amazing prize was offered. Luffy instantly thinks the man is talking about the meat that he thought Doflamingo was talking about earlier, only for Franky to say he just said it was something he'd want, not meat.
The scene changes to Corrida Coliseum. A soldier standing at the entrance, barring children from entering and shooting at any that try to do so. Inside the stadium, the announcer is building up the crowd, saying that no word can rightly describe the awesomeness of what they are about to see.

Episode 634,The Pirate Prince Cavendish,23-Feb-14,"The famous beautiful pirate Cavendish makes an entrance, and proceeds to explain to Luffy (not realizing his identity) the rules of entertainment in the Colosseum, the nature and appeal of bloodsport, his past as a world-shaking pirate and lastly, his intent to kill The Eleven Supernovas for stealing his spotlight two years ago.
While Luffy stares in awe at a great bronze statue of a warrior, a gladiator, Rebecca, arrives and explains to him the legend of Kyros the Undefeated who disappeared from battle for 20 years. The announcer then calls out that the Block A battle royale is over and that the champion is a large man with a paper bag over his head. To the spectacle of the entire Colosseum, the man removes the bag and reveals himself to be Jesus Burgess, the captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, who gestures and cheers over the broken bodies of his defeated opponents.
Meanwhile, the Thunder Soldier takes Franky to a private place so they can discuss Franky's 'job'. While the Marines notice that there are several competitors in the competition, the blind man is revealed to be the Admiral, Fujitora. Just then, Luffy is confronted by none other than Bellamy the Hyena.","As Cavendish attempts to talk to Lucy, he is ignored due to Lucy's attention to him focusing on the weight limit. Luffy then asks why is everyone almost naked, to which the prince explains that the spectators want to see blood and that in the arena you can see humanity's true colors exposed.
The prince then asks Luffy who he is. Luffy tells him his real name and exclaims that he is going to be the Pirate King, drawing attention from the crowd. However, they see that his name tag states Lucy and assume he mispronounced his own name. The prince laughs and says that if he really was Luffy, he would take his head here and now, because when he came to the New World about three years ago he made a big name for himself but his fame was overshadowed by the Battle of Marineford, the Eleven Supernovas and the Blackbeard Pirates. Thus, he carries a grudge against any who is in ""the Worst Generation"".
He then is ignored again by Luffy, who notices a statue and his resemblance to it in his armor. Rebecca, a female gladiator, tells Luffy that it is a statue of Kyros, the mightiest gladiator in the history of the Corrida Colosseum, stating that he won 3000 consecutive matches and that he only took a single blow throughout them all, but that he retired 20 years ago and that no one knows his true identity. She wonders if he truly existed and how the bronze statue appeared one day out of the blue. She then declares her intention of winning the Mera Mera no Mi and killing Doflamingo. The announcer proclaims that the first block battle royale is over and the winner is revealed to be Jesus Burgess, the captain of the first ship of Blackbeard's crew.
Seeing this, Franky begins to rethink if Luffy would have an easy time in the tournament and realizes he is in for a struggle. Thunder Soldier then takes Franky to a private place so they can discuss Franky's 'job'.
An unknown Marine starts to panic, stating that they need reinforcements because the competitors' power surpassed his expectations. The adviser of the Barto Club, the Missionary Gambia, gets on the bad side of Vice Admiral Maynard, who is there undercover as a competitor, and gets taken out. At this point we see Bartolomeo watching from the shadows.
It is time for the Block B battle royal and the announcer shouts that it is time to let the athletes in. The blind man and a young Marine leave the Colosseum and discuss what they plan to do about the current situation. It is then that the blind man wears his admiral coat and is revealed to be the famous Marine Admiral Fujitora. Before Block B starts, Luffy is confronted by Bellamy.","Cavendish, Monkey D.

Episode 635,The Fateful Reunion - Bellamy the Hyena,2-Mar-14,"Luffy meets an unexpected acquaintance from the past, Bellamy. Meanwhile, the Caesar handover team learn about Green Bit, and on the Sunny, the four who remained to watch the ship hear noises from inside.","The episode starts out with Franky in the stands, exclaiming his shock to see such a powerful competitor as Jesus Burgess, thinking that Luffy would win the tournament easily. He then gets up to leave and do his job, but the Thunder Soldier says that he wants to go too, much to the annoyance of Franky.
At a northeastern cafe the members of the group responsible for exchanging Caesar are asking about Green Bit, but are told to avoid it saying that there are fighting fish which are very dangerous. He also says that no one who used the iron bridge to Green Bit has ever come back. Usopp and Caesar plead with Law asking to change the drop off location, but Law refuses. Law is more worried about the lack of panic even though Doflamingo, their king, has just resigned, but his worries are cut short by the arrival of CP0, the world's strongest intelligence agency.
Elsewhere Zoro is seen chasing the ""fairy"" that stole his sword to the top of a building and takes it back, only to go over the side and fall to the ground with the 'fairy' falling with him. Meanwhile Kin'emon gets lost and is surrounded by enemies who seem to have captured Kanjuro. Also staying true to his promise Sanji beats a mysterious sniper much to the pleasure of Violet. Back at the ship, the group protecting the Thousand Sunny are playing Shogun, when suddenly they hear a mysterious noise.
Back at the colosseum Bartolomeo enters the arena, while one of the referees asks if he has seen Capman, who is shown to be defeated. Bartolomeo walks into the arena as the announcer is introducing him. He calls Bartolomeo cruel and crazy, citing an incident involving him skewering pirates and broadcasting it, and holds the number one spot for the person people most want to disappear. Bartolomeo is then introduced through a character box, listing his bounty at 150,000,000. Bartolomeo raises his hands and declares that he is sending everyone to hell.","Bellamy, Monkey D.

Episode 636,Supernova! Bartolomeo the Cannibal,16-Mar-14,"The Block B battle begins. Bartolomeo is heckled by the crowd as he enters the colosseum. He responds by throwing a fake bomb into the stands. Cavendish tells Luffy about the competitors and reveals why he hates the new supernovas. Meanwhile, Bellamy defeats a number of competitors in quick succession, leading him to be targeted by the alliance formed by Dagama in order to protect King Elizabello II. Luffy and Cavendish are approached by a large man who asks how Garp is doing, inadvertently revealing Luffy's true identity to Cavendish.","Bartolomeo raises his hands and declares that he is sending everyone to hell. The crowd starts booing, telling him to get lost. He responds by making faces and then throws an object into the crowd. One of the workers asks what he thinks he is doing. People in the audience start to run and duck for cover after someone screams that he threw a bomb. Everyone stops when they hear the oddly normal sound the ""bomb"" makes when it lands. It turns out that Bartolomeo simply threw a ball at them. Dagama sarcastically commends him for his great job winning over the crowd, calling him a thug. Bartolomeo says he does not care what they think of him.
The announcer then introduces another contestant, calling him the opposite of Bartolomeo; a man with only the utmost devotion to Doflamingo who swore allegiance to their king after bringing him a pillar made of gold from another country. The crowd gets excited with anticipation, knowing whom the announcer is talking about. Thanks to him, every country that's insulted Dressrosa by calling them pirates has been destroyed by this man, known as the murderous bomb of Dressrosa. And now this man has a one in a lifetime opportunity.
As Bellamy walks out into the light of the arena, the announcer tells the crowd that if Bellamy wins the tournament today, he will be promoted to a high executive position in the Donquixote Family, and is one of the favorites to win the tournament. He finishes his introduction by presenting Bellamy the Hyena. Cavendish looks at Bellamy somewhat jealously, remarking on his large following.
The announcer swings a wooden mallet down on the starting bell and the match gets under way. Bellamy is trying to decide where to begin when he sees several fighters get thrown back. Tank Lepanto, Elizabello II, and Dagama discuss if they should take out Bellamy first, to which the tactician says yes, as they must take out the stronger fighters while they still have numbers on their side. Bellamy asks what they are doing, and Bartolomeo remarks that the battle isn't really a battle royale anymore. Dagama tells them they can complain all they want when they are dead. All that matters is who the last person standing is.
Block B continues, and the audience realizes that Dagama has formed an alliance with other competitors. The announcer announces the news to the entire Colosseum, and tells the audience that this action is not against the rules, and announces who the mastermind of the operation is. Dagama thinks to himself that there is no way for his kingdom to lose this, due to the immense strength of their king, Elizabello II.
Dagama then asks Elizabello how his preparations are going, and Elizabello replies by saying that he is ready to go anytime. Dagama then tells his men to defend the king, and to continue thinning the numbers in order to ensure their victory. Bellamy then mocks Tank Lepanto for teaming up with Dagama and Elizabello, due to his status as defense captain of Dressrosa. Lepanto responds by saying that money is what makes the world go round, and that dreams are unimportant, because he prefers to collect the easiest money he can possibly acquire. Bellamy laughs, and attacks Lepanto. In the midst of their clash, three other competitors fall into the lake. The three fighters are disqualified, and then the announcer tells the audience what is inside the lake; a school of little flying fish. The crowd cheers as the flying fish show themselves. The announcer then goes onto say that there's no way anybody can emerge from the fight unscathed, because it is the Corrida Colosseum.
Meanwhile, in the participants viewing area, Cavendish explains to Luffy why people call Bartolomeo ""The Cannibal"". He goes on to say this is due to his mockery of others, and says that Bartolomeo is one of the cheeky kids who rose to fame after him. Luffy then states that this is exciting, and asks Cavendish what his name is. Cavendish replies by saying that he is Cavendish, and Luffy then asks him what he has in his hand (but calls him Cabbage instead). Cavendish replies by saying that he is checking on his bounty posters of The Worst Generation, and says that he will probably need to get new ones soon due to all the knife marks he has left on them. Luffy tells him that he should probably just forgive them, but Cavendish replies that he just wants to kill them. Cavendish then goes onto say that he thought at least one would be there, due to the prize offered. He then states that they may be hiding their face, as Burgess did before, and says that he will wait for them among the survivors.
Suddenly, Don Chinjao interrupts the conversation, and comments on the view of the match from the area. Chinjao then asks Luffy how Garp is doing, and refers to him as Straw Hat Luffy. Luffy then asks him if he knows his grandpa, which causes Cavendish to become shocked. Luffy then realizes that he has revealed his identity. Chinjao explains that a long time ago, Garp nearly killed him, and that he has decided to hold a grudge against his descendants. This causes Luffy to say nothing more than ""what?""","Bartolomeo, Cavendish, Monkey D.

Episode 637,Big Names Duke It Out! The Heated Block B Battle!,23-Mar-14,"Seeing that his true identity is exposed, Luffy tries to defend himself from Chinjao's devastating headbutts and Cavendish's irrational hatred while trying in vain to convince them he's ""Lucy"". Luckily, Chinjao's grandsons manage to intervene and halt Don Chinjao's rampage before he gets disqualified. They convinced him that they should focus on the ""real prize"" and that since Luffy is in Block C, they can kill him in the ring without repercussions. Cavendish, however, intends to kill Luffy before the match and proceeds to hunt down Luffy, who escaped the fight and is hiding outside, hanging underneath the stands window.
At the Battle Royale, only 30 combatants remain in the ring with the numbers being further reduced with the defeat of Tank Lepanto by Abdullah and Jeet who are in turn defeated by Bellamy. However, much to everyone's disgust, Bartolomeo proceeds to urinate in the water in front of the audience. Hack sees this as a vulgar display and attacks him from behind, but somehow his attack was nullified and his arm broken and bleeding while Bartolomeo remains unscathed, leaving everyone who witnessed this shocked and confused at what happened.","In the participant's viewing area, Don Chinjao tells Luffy and Cavendish about Garp's reputation in the past, and how he is considered a demon by many pirates, and about how Garp gave him scars. Cavendish questions Luffy about his true identity, but Luffy tells him that he isn't Luffy, and is Lucy. Chinjao states that he will take out his grudge from Garp on Luffy, and Luffy replies by telling Chinajo to take it out on Garp instead. Cavendish then asks Luffy if he is really Garp's grandson, and Luffy replies by saying that he is Lucy. Cavendish then tries to pulls out his sword, and tells Luffy that if he is really Straw Hat Luffy, then he will cut him down right there. Chinjao then states that he wishes he had discovered the identity of Monkey D. Dragon earlier, so that Luffy would have never been born. Chinjao attacks Luffy as he says this.
Nearby, other gladiators notice Chinajo rampaging against Luffy. Luffy tells Chinjao to hold on, and Cavendish approaches Luffy and tries to pull off his beard. The spectators then state that Chinjao is not a joke, and that he once had a bounty of over five hundred million Bellies. Chinjao then prepares to attack Cavendish and Luffy. Cavendish draws his sword, and nearby gladiators identify it as Durandal, one of the world's greatest blades. Cavendish states that Luffy is his prey, but Chinjao ignores him and charges at him and Luffy. Cavendish blocks Chinjao with Durandal, and nearby gladiators note that the sword pierced his head. The gladiators then notice that Chinjao stopped the blade, and that it actually did not pierce his head. The gladiators then exclaim that the fighters cannot be human, due to their extraordinary strength. Chinjao then continues to relentlessly attack Cavendish and Luffy, and Cavendish says that they cannot cut corners if they want to take him down. Luffy then gets angry, and knocks Chinjao into the ground.
The gladiators then exclaim that Luffy has kicked Chinjao's ass, and question his identity. The gladiators are then shocked when Chinjao stands back up, unscathed from the encounter. The gladiators then speak about the myths that surround Chinjao, including him breaking an arctic continent with a headbutt. Luffy is also surprised that his attack did no damage. Chinjao then states that even though Cavendish and Luffy have talent, it is too soon for them to be facing him. Cavendish then fully believes that the disguised Lucy is Luffy, and Luffy replies by telling him to leave him alone. Cavendish then states that Luffy is good at getting people to hate him, due to stealing people's popularity and being born the grandson of Garp. Luffy then says that he did not know any of those things, but then corrects himself by saying that he is Lucy. Chinjao then tells Cavendish that if his intention is to get in his way, then he will just take him down as well.
Suddenly, Sai and Boo show up, and tell Chinjao that this is as far as he should go for now. They state that he will be disqualified if he does this now, and grab him in order to stop him. Chinjao tells them to get their hands off him, and also says that he has finally found the bloodline of Garp. Sai and Boo respond by saying that if he is disqualified now, they will be unable to achieve their real objective for which they joined the tournament. The Colosseum guards show up, and tell the group that if they are fighting, then they will kick them out. Cavendish notices this, and says that he does not care if he gets kicked out, but then he notices that Luffy has disappeared. Sai and Boo then tell Chinjao that he can kill Luffy in Block C, since they are in the same block together. Cavendish then says that he will not let Luffy get away, and states that he is going to take his life before the match even starts.
A few of the spectators then question what they have heard, which is that Straw Hat Luffy is there. Luffy is then seen hanging on the side of a window, and he remembers how he promised Franky he would not let himself get caught. The announcer of the battle announces that Tank Lepanto has been defeated by Abdullah and Jeet. Jeet laughs, and the audience states that the two of them always play dirty tricks, and call out Lepanto's name. The announcer states that in such a short time, over one hundred contestants have been eliminated, and that only thirty contestants remain. Dagama then states that as long as his kingdom has the king's punch, they will win. Blue Gilly attacks Ricky, and Abdullah and Jeet taunt the other gladiators.
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the block, Abdullah and Jeet are fighting other competitors. While Abdullah attacks them from the front, Jeet attacks them from the back, which causes one of the fighters to tell Jeet that what they are doing is cheating. The two then stand beside one another, and Abdullah states how much he loves the sound of fighting.
Elsewhere in the block, a fighter tells Hack that fish-men should not put their noses where they do not belong. He goes on to say that Hack should not be there, because he is a monster. The fighter continues to mock Hack, but then Hack tells him that instead of speaking with his mouth, he should speak with his fists. The fighter then attacks Hack with his spiked mace, but Hack is undamaged from it, and knocks the fighter back with a four thousand tile punch. Hack then goes onto say even though the fish-men place their faith in Jinbe (who is also Hack's friend), the fish-men should also fight back with fists.
Elsewhere in the block, a gladiator notices that an unfamiliar face is there. They point out his strength, and say that they have never seen him in a battle before. They go on to point out that he is only using one sword, unlike the other gladiators who use both sword and shield, and that he must be a samurai from Wano Country. This gladiator is revealed to be Ricky, and he attacks the men, and tells them that they are too slow.
Abdullah and Jeet defeat Tank using dirty methods. Suddenly, Bellamy appears and attacks the duo. He is able to defeat them, and the audience exclaims how cruel and atrocious Bellamy's actions are. The audience then points out Hack, and say that he is strong. They point out that he is using Fish-Man Karate, and that he is cool, because of all the one hit knock outs he has achieved in the battle. The announcer then announces Hack's feat in the tournament, and also notices someone on the other side. The audience wonder what this person is doing. The announcer then asks Bartolomeo how long he plans on annoying people. while the audience bays for someone to beat him. The announcer then points out how Bartolomeo is peeing into the lake in the middle of the battle, and says that never in the history of the Colosseum has this happened. The announcer also wonders if there is anybody that will stop Bartolomeo's silliness.
Suddenly, the announcer spots Hack approaching Bartolomeo. Hack states that there are people who actually are taking the tournament seriously, and also says to forgive him for attacking from the behind. Hack prepares to attack Bartolomeo, and Bartolomeo tells him not to attack a defenseless man. The announcer says that Hack is the arena's hero, and the audience cheers him on. Hack attacks Bartolomeo, but his hand breaks in the process. The audience is shocked, and the announcer questions how Hack is the one on the ground, Luffy is shown to be shocked, and the announcer questions what Bartolomeo really is.","Chinjao, Monkey D.

Episode 638,A Deadly Blow! The Astonishing King Punch,30-Mar-14,"With Hack defeated and the remaining fighters reduced to 24, the battle royale is nearly over. Bellamy faces off Bartolomeo while at the same time Blue Gilly defeats Ricky. The bribed fighters protecting Elizabello II guard themselves from Blue Gilly's assault but were backstabbed by Dagama who revealed that Blue Gilly was his partner, but Dagama secretly plans to betray Blue Gilly. However, the long legged martial artist never trusted the tactical schemer and quickly knocks him out of the ring.
Bellamy is currently struggling against Bartolomeo while at the same time, Elizabello II is cornered but is fully prepared to unleash his devastating punch. The audience heard of the fighting king's reputation and proceeds to get out of the way of his punch. When Blue Gilly moves in for the kill, the king delivers the punch at point blank, creating a destructive shockwave throughout the ring. When the smoke cleared, Elizabello II and Bartolomeo were the only ones standing with the latter revealing his Devil fruit and the former being defeated by that power. Bartolomeo is now the champion of the Block B battle royale.
Meanwhile, Franky is informed by Thunder Soldier that he too is part of an operation to destroy the SMILE factory but needs the cyborg's help in rescuing the workers held prisoner there. The toy soldier then prepares to tell Franky the history of Dressrosa.","Bartolomeo kicks Hack and knocks him out, eliminating him from the competition, this astonishes the crowd including the commentator who apparently was cheering for Hack to win. The commentator then gets control of himself and announces that the B block battle is still anyone's game and that there are 24 participants left, some of the combatants still left standing being: Bellamy the Hyena, Bartolomeo the cannibal, Dagama, King Elizabello II the fighting king, Blue Gilly, and Ricky.
Dagama then announces to Blue Gilly that everyone is wounded and that now is the time, Blue Gilly then kicks Ricky in the helmet, and wounds him gravely. Blue Gilly questions Ricky as to ""what he is trying to cut, with a dull sword"" while Ricky lies on the ground commenting that he can not win against time, and that he hates the cheers and that he hates Doflamingo. Blue Gilly and Dagama then attack the gladiators that Dagama had bribed into helping him from behind, betraying them, Dagama then tries to double cross Blue Gilly and attack him from behind, but Blue Gilly notices and counters with a kick that knocks Dagama out of the ring and promptly gets attacked by a fighting fish as insult to injury. Blue Gilly knew never to trust a schemer like him and was watching his back the whole time, earning him the praise from the audience.
Meanwhile Bellamy has been fighting Bartolomeo and is on death's door, been severely outclassed by him, Bellamy then comments that Bartolomeo must have eaten a Devil Fruit. The spectators noticed that Bellamy was mysteriously hurt after he attacked Bartolomeo just like Hack, while Luffy still hanging from a window sill shouts encouragement at Bellamy.
Meanwhile a group of competitors have ganged up on king Elizabello II, while Blue Gilly taunts him saying that he is now unprotected to which the king retorts back to Blue Gilly with a threat of his own. The crowd is now very curious as to what will happen next, as they have heard about the power of Elizabello's punches, and they decide to run away when he starts preparing to punch. As Elizabello is about to punch, Blue Gilly quickly moves in with the intent to break the king's neck while Bellamy has managed to catch Bartolomeo with his hands, when he felt the power eliminating from the king and turns around to sees in horror that he and Bartolomeo are directly in the path of the punch. With the power channeled in an hour of focus, Elizabello unleashes his punch directly in front of Blue Gilly, breaking the sound barrier and releasing an unstoppable shock wave, destroying anything in its path and sent everyone in the ring flying and out of the fight. The punch alone generated a blinding light that prevents anyone from seeing whats happening. Outside of the colosseum, by passers stop to look at the rising smoke and the loud sound that came from the colosseum. As the smoke clears, the shaken commentator crawled out of the safety of his stand and announces to the audience that every fighter except for Elizabello II had been knocked out.
Before he could announce the winner, one of the audience shouts out there is still someone else standing, and the smoke clears revealing a transparent barrier protecting not only the audience from the brunt of the punch but Bartolomeo as well. Bartolomeo then reveals that he ate the Bari Bari no Mi, a devil fruit that allows him to create a barrier when he crosses his fingers, he then attacks Elizabello with a barrier which proves to be powerful enough to injure him and sent him skidding near the edge of the ring. With the last remaining fighter knocked out, the commentator announces Bartolomeo as the winner of the B block battle royale which disappoints the crowd.
Meanwhile inside the corridor leading to the seats, Thunder Soldier reveals to Franky that he is also planning to destroy the factory. Franky demands to know the location of it but Thunder Soldier tells him they must first free the workers and that their tactic is important as it will bring the fall of Dressrosa.

Episode 639,The Fighting Fish Strike! Break through the Deadly Iron Bridge,6-Apr-14,"The episode starts with a previous flashback of the Block B match, depictions including the King Punch and Bartolomeo's victory, much to the resentment of the crowd. Luffy is seen still hanging, and slingshots his way into the building after watching Bartolomeo win. He walks to the main entrance where the injured fighters are being carried off. He converses with an injured Bellamy, who acknowledges Luffy's strength and use of Haki. When he calls Luffy ""Straw Hat"", Bartolomeo hears this and is shocked. Later, it is announced that the Block C match is about to start.
The scene changes to Law and his group, who are about to cross the bridge. They are attacked by a school of Fighting Fish, but manages to get to Green Bit safely. Law is revealed to have Caesar's heart, the latter who is freed of his bonds for help. They also overhear strange voices at a point on the bridge. Green Bit is shown to be a dense jungle. 
The plot shifts to Sanji's location, where he and Violet arrives at the next town. Sanji attacks some thugs in a warehouse and disposes of them easily. When the two recent lovebirds share a moment, Violet cuffs Sanji and is revealed to know Sanji's true identity as Black Leg, much to Sanji's astonishment.","After the B block battle royale has finished Bellamy is being taken away on a stretcher and as he passes Luffy he comments that he has not changed a bit, Luffy on the other hand disagrees and that he has changed. Bellamy laughs at this and tells Luffy that he is the one that has changed, commenting on his exceptional Haki, he then tells Luffy that the whole rooting for him thing has crushed his pride and calls him ""Straw Hat"", which gets the attention of Bartolomeo who is standing a couple feet away.
At the bridge to Green Bit the ""Caesar Exchange Team"" is making their way across the iron bridge with 45 minutes left until the agreed upon time to exchange Caesar Clown. Unfortunately for them they are being attacked by a school of Fighting Fish who are so big that the iron bridge bends easily under their weight, which prompts Robin to wonder if they really are fish to which Law responds that they are, although Usopp disagrees and Caesar says they are the same as sea monsters. But Law does not seem very agitated by the fish and comments that it is not a problem that Usopp and Robin cannot handle, which confuses Usopp who believes that since Law is a Shichibukai he should be the one dealing with the fish. The school of fish starts to attack the bridge again forcing Robin and Usopp to deal with them, much to the happiness of Law, but realizing that there are too many fish to deal with they decide to make a run for it. Law also tells Usopp to take off Caesar's handcuffs so that he may help out, stating that Caesar will not run away as long as he is still in possession of Caesar's heart, which angers Caesar. Caesar helps out by defeating some of the fish while the other three run, Usopp then asks Law again as to why he is not fighting to which Law responds that he has to save all his energy for his fight with Doflamingo much to Caesar's shock.
The group then encounters some more bad luck as the next part of the bridge has been destroyed by the fish as well as the fact that it is surrounded by fog and what is worse another fighting fish jumps out of the water to attack the group. Fortunately the fish is stopped by some kind of fishing net much to the surprise of the group, voices are then heard on the other side of the bridge which makes the group wonder who it may be and Usopp calls out asking if anyone is on the other side and if they can help them get across. This however surprises and scares off the mysterious strangers, Law then makes Caesar use his gas powers to fly the group over to Green Bit much to the annoyance of Caesar.
Upon arriving at Green Bit the group can not find any traces of the people who captured the fish and notice both the large number of wrecked ships and the giant, lush forest of Green Bit. Law then obverses that the southeast beach is just up ahead while Usopp notices a Marine ship that had crashed into the island and Robin uses her binoculars to confirm that the ship had damaged the plants and trees just recently. Robin also notes that the ship itself is not very damaged and Caesar starts to get paranoid that the exchange has been compromised and complains to Law who is wondering how to make his next move. Caesar begs Law to call off the exchange as the Marines are there and he is an enemy of the Marines, but Law refuses, noting that since he is an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates the Marines are now his enemy too and that he will need Robin and Usopp's skills to check out the forest and make sure there is nothing strange going on.
Meanwhile, Sanji is still with Violet and finds some of Doflamingo's men who attempt to attack Violet, to which Sanji easily defeats them. Just then, Violet takes advantage of Sanji's affections and cuff him, revealing her true nature.","Bartolomeo, Elizabello II (K.O.), Blue Gilly, Monkey D.

As they explore, Robin and Usopp discovers a squad of Marines who are getting attacked by the forest's inhabitants, losing all of their belongings. As soon as the Marines fled, Robin uses her Devil Fruit power to capture the fast and seemingly invisible thieves. Usopp asks her what she has caught, and she tells him that she believes they are dwarves.
Meanwhile at Acacia, Zoro has captured his sword thief, a dwarf named Wicca, who berated herself for being caught. Because the fall sprained her ankle, she begged Zoro to take her to the flower field to deliver a report that the Donquixote family is planning to attack the Straw Hat's ship. Zoro had no choice but to take her with him due to his horrible sense of direction.
With Violet revealing her true self, Sanji was seen beaten and bloodied before Violet who was actually an assassin sent to interrogate him about Law's plan. Her Devil Fruit power allows her to look into Sanji's mind for the truth, only to recoil from seeing Sanji's perverted mind. Sanji, who was barely conscious, told her that he never doubted her tears, leaving her genuinely shocked, brought to tears by his honesty.","Upon arriving at Green Bit, the group can not find any traces of the people who captured the fish and notice both the large number of wrecked ships and the giant, lush forest of Green Bit.

Robin and Usopp then leave to search the forest with 14 minutes until the exchange takes place with Robin taking the lead and Usopp trailing behind. The two then notice a bunch of Marines in a clearing talking with an unknown person, the Marines ask if he is a Straw Hat to which the unknown person comments that he is not and that his name is Leo. Leo then asks whether the Marines are good guys or bad guys, to which the Marines respond that they are good guys, prompting Leo to ask that they lay down their weapons. Unfortunately the Marines do not and in the blink of an eye they are stripped down to their underwear. The Marines run away while Robin uses a new technique to try and capture the culprits, whom she believes are dwarves.
Meanwhile, at Dressrosa's port city, Acacia, Zoro is running with a dwarf named Wicca. Wicca was the ""fairy"" that had stolen Zoro's sword and, because of an ankle injury that she got from being chased by Zoro, she is relying on him for transportation. While Zoro is relying on Wicca for directions due to his lack of an internal compass, Wicca also informs Zoro of several things she has found out during her recon mission such as the fact that Doflamingo's crew is on their way to attack the Straw Hat's ship.
Back in Dressrosa, Sanji is seen beaten and bloodied up, surrounded by Doflamingo’s men, while Violet reveals that she fooled Sanji and actually knew who he was all along. She comments that she had heard that Sanji was weak to women, but did not realize it was this bad. It is then discovered that Violet is actually an assassin for Doflamingo and a part of the Trébol Army. Sanji however, refuses to believe that Violet is a bad person and says she has a kind heart but is somewhere she does not want to be because she was tempted by some bad people. This apparently angers Violet and she kicks Sanji in the face, telling him to stop being in love. She believes Sanji is lying to her and is actually suppressing his anger while searching for a way out.
Violet then demonstrates her Devil Fruit power that allows her to see through people’s clothes and even into their minds. After looking into Sanji’s mind, she finds out that Law and Luffy have teamed up but is unsure of their reasons for being on Dressrosa. She then looks into Sanji’s mind again but is repulsed by his perverted thoughts and demands to know why she cannot see the details of his crew's plan. Sanji replies that he can only think of her. Sanji then tells Violet that he believes she was telling the truth when she asked him to kill a man for her due to the tears in her eyes and shouts he'll never doubt a woman's tears, leaving Violet deeply touched by his words.","Usopp, Caesar Clown, Nico Robin, Trafalgar Law, Smoker (flashback), Leo (shadowed), Kabu, Roronoa Zoro, Wicca, Nami (imagination), Momonosuke (imagination), Tony Tony Chopper (imagination), Brook (imagination), Chinjao, Sai, Boo, Monkey D.

Episode 641,The Unknown World - The Tontatta Kingdom,20-Apr-14,"Robin found herself captured by dwarves after they knocked her and Usopp unconscious. When she told them that she will not harm them, the dwarves released her leaving her baffled at them being so trusting.
Sanji, who's barely conscious, tells Violet that he never doubted her tears, leaving her genuinely shocked. Before her subordinates could kill Sanji, she quickly defeated them and proceeded to warn Sanji of the grand deception Doflamingo and the World Government pulled.
At the colosseum, the C block battle royale has started, and Luffy is excited to win this for the prize.
At the exchange site, Law received a call from Sanji, who attempts to warn Law about something he just heard from Violet.","Robin woke up to find a bunch of dwarves climbing on her looking for anything suspicious, much to her shock. When she tried to get up, a certain dwarf by the name of Leo informed her that she better stay down, while another named Kabu informed the other dwarves that she used a weird magic. She then recalls how she captured Kabu but how she was then knocked out by an anesthetic flower along with Usopp. After that she is informed that she is currently located under the forest of Green Bit and that she should not try to escape as she is sewn to the ground due to the power of Nui Nui. Robin then apologized to the dwarves promising that she will keep their secret for them, at first the dwarves did not believe her but after being reassured by Robin again they immediately trusted her much to Robin's shock. However, the Tontatta Kingdom's chief arrived and demanded to know what was going on, to which Leo explained that Robin is a good person which he believed immediately, which again shocked Robin.
Robin then noticed that it is almost time for the exchange and that she must get going, she then asked that the dwarves return her Den Den Mushi but is informed that it has been returned to the wild. After that she asked to be led to the exit but the dwarves say that if she truly is a good person then she will give them her weapons, though Robin said she does not have any weapons. The dwarves then told her that she must be stripped and they attacked her. She is saved, however, by another dwarf named Flapper who quickly informed them that she is the friend of the legendary warrior who was with her. Robin knew that ""legendary warrior"" would be one of Usopp's lies and wondered what lies he sprouted out at them.
Meanwhile in Dressrosa, Sanji then tells Violet that he believes she was telling the truth when she asked him to kill a man for her due to the tears in her eyes. This angers Doflamingo’s men and they decide to kill Sanji, however, Violet, who was touched by Sanji’s words, uses her Devil Fruit powers to defeat them.
Violet then tells Sanji that he was right about her and was thankful that he still believed in an enemy like her. Sanji then invites Violet to escape with him and his crew on their ship but Violet tells him that they have fallen into a trap. She then lets Sanji look into her mind using her Devil Fruit powers and see her memories from the morning.
And at the Corrida Colosseum the C block match was about to start. Rebecca was seen reminiscing with her thoughts until she noticed Franky and the Thunder Soldier running. Her eyes began to well up with tears as she recognizes the tin soldier she knew so much. She called out to Thunder Soldier who saw her and Franky stopped for a minute. The tin soldier told her that when he saw the list of participants he couldn't believe she would willingly come back there. With her emotions spilling out, she cried out that she will win the tournament this time and when she is done they can be together. Thunder Soldier however, told her that a crying warrior won't win the tournament and asked Franky to hurry to their destination. Franky, still confused at what was going on, wondered if it was okay to leave her crying, but the tin soldier explained to him that even toys have things they want to protect. However, for the tin soldier, even tears won't fall from his tin eyes leaving Franky in thought over his words and quickly left the arena as Rebecca sank to her knees with her burdening emotions.
Finally, back at Green Bit's southeastern beach, with two minutes left before the meeting, Trafalgar Law is informed by Sanji who has urgently phoned him that the exchange is in fact a trap.","Violet, Sanji, Donquixote Doflamingo (flashback), Gatz (voice), Monkey D.

Back at the Colosseum, the next rounds begins but Luffy struggles to hide his powers.","Law and Caesar Clown are waiting for Doflamingo at the rendezvous point in Green Bit. He then receives a call from Sanji, who is escaping with Viola from Doflamingo's men. During the conversation Sanji is forced to knock down some thugs when he got cornered in a small alley, he then continues to speak. He tells Law that Doflamingo's resignation is a hoax and that handing over Caesar would not be a trade whatsoever. Sanji warns Law to leave Green Bit before it is too late.
During a flashback, Viola informs Sanji about Doflamingo's plan by using her power to show him what happened in Dressrosa that morning. Sanji sees people screaming in panic outside the royal palace: they want to know why Doflamingo abdicated the throne. In the palace, Doflamingo is annoyed with all the commotion outside and wonders why 'they' are not here yet. It is then that CP0 arrives on the island with a ship bearing their symbol. The shortest CP0 agent tells the citizens that the earlier announcement of Doflamingo's resignation from the Shichibukai and his abdication from the Dressrosan throne is false. The citizens are relieved to hear this and they start cheering. The CP0 agent proceeds to say that the mistake will be corrected through an extra edition of the newspaper, set to be released at 3 p.m. He warns the citizens to keep this information a secret until the extra edition is released. After the agent's announcement, Viola stops using her power and affirms to a shocked and confused Sanji that everything that he has just seen is true.
Back in the present time, Sanji again urges Law to leave the island. Doflamingo is then seen approaching the island using his devil fruit ability to cross the waters between Dressrosa and Green Bit. On another part of the island Issho leads a group of Marines. He stops walking when talking over a Baby Den Den Mushi to Sakazuki. Issho asks if Marine Headquarters were fooled by the false report. Sakazuki admits that they were indeed tricked and says that he is going to talk to the Five Elders in Mary Geoise. He orders Issho to go to the rendezvous point. Sanji tells Law one last time to leave the island before hanging up. Just as Law tries to decide on what he should do, Robin's upper half sprouts from the ground. This surprises Caesar and Robin explains that what they see is just a clone. She then tells Law that she had heard the conversation and asked if the caller was Sanji. Law asks Robin where she and Usopp are. He then goes on to say that, if Sanji's report is true, the deal with Doflamingo is off, much to Caesar's dismay. Law asks Robin to summon Usopp. Robin answers that she cannot help at the moment, since she and Usopp are both stuck underground Green Bit. She says that if Law is going to escape, he has to leave them behind. However, just as Law agrees to leave, he notices Issho and a group of marines walking towards him. Doflamingo then also arrives on the island, while Robin dissolves her clone. It is then exactly 3 p.m.
Meanwhile, in the Corrida Colosseum, Gatz announces the arrival of all the Block C gladiators, and announces the start of the battle. Meanwhile, in the pathway leading to the Colosseum, Cavendish is hurrying to go to the ring to find Luffy but was stopped by the guards. Back again to the ring, Luffy's identity was almost exposed when he kept stretching, which is noted by some gladiators that he can stretch like rubber. Near the entrance of the ring, Cavendish shouted that ""Lucy"" is Luffy in disguise, but was not heard by anybody.
Meanwhile, a group of News Coos delivered an another issue of that day's newspaper, telling everyone that Doflamingo's resignation is false, and earned everyone's shock.
Back in Green Bit, Law asks Doflamingo as if he really used the powers of the World Government and tricked the whole world just to fool ten pirates, and said that he is only a pirate, even if he is a Shichibukai, he should not be able to do such a big thing as having a fake news printed, an act that only World Nobles have the authority. A flashback of Vergo is seen, saying that Law does not know Joker's past, and that will cost his life. This made Law think if Doflamingo is a World Noble.

Usopp and Robin learn from the dwarves that Mont Blanc Noland came to their island in the past and is considered a hero by them. Usopp lies to the dwarves that he is a descendant of Noland, only for them to ask for his help in defeating the Doflamingo Pirates. ","During the confrontation between Law, Doflamingo and Issho on Green Bit, Caesar Clown yells to ""Joker"" to finish off Law already. Law tells Doflamingo that he broke his promise and they were going to have to start their deal from scratch again. However, Doflamingo laughs at this and tells Law to leave his subordinate Caesar alone. At that moment, Issho and his men realize that Law’s hostage is none other than Caesar Clown, the criminal scientist behind the poison gas incident. However, Issho says that because he is the subordinate of a Shichibukai, he is exempt of his crimes.
Doflamingo then directs his attention to Issho and asks if he is really Fujitora, the man who was assigned to admiral at the World Military Draft. He then says that he has heard stories about Fujitora and Ryokugyu being true beasts in terms of power. Issho responds that, although he is still new to the Marines, he cannot understand what Doflamingo is doing on Green Bit. He then states that he has received information that Doflamingo is not following the rules as a Shichibukai. Doflamingo laughs at this and says that if he plans to investigate him, he will need to be prepared to back up his claims before he says anything.
Doflamingo then asks what the Marines have decided in the matter of Law’s disposal. Issho says that if Law really is in an alliance with the Straw Hat Pirates, then he is no longer a Shichibukai. However, he says that if the Straw Hats are just Law’s subordinates, then Law can remain a Shichibukai. Law analyzes the situation and decides to buy some time by telling Issho that he is in an alliance with the Straw Hats. Doflamingo laughs once again and Issho officially revokes Law’s title as Shichibukai and then prepares to attack.
Issho then uses his Devil Fruit abilities to cause a meteor to fall out of the sky right on top of them, much to Law and Doflamingo’s shock. Caesar and Issho’s men run for it but Law, Doflamingo and Issho use their Devil Fruit abilities to cut the meteorite into pieces. The falling meteorite pieces create a large crater around them, leaving only their footholds left. A furious Doflamingo then asks Issho what the Fleet Admiral taught him. Law comments that it does not matter if Issho can see or not. Issho responds that he was just testing his strength a little.
Back on Dressrosa, Franky is talking to Sanji via the Den Den Mushi. Franky informs Sanji that he and Thunder Soldier are heading to the flower field while Sanji informs Franky that he has fallen in love. Franky tells him that that is great and he is going to find the factory soon but it is going to be bigger job than they originally thought. Sanji then tries to inform Franky about Doflamingo's trick, but Franky says that he already read the newspaper about it and plans to destroy the factory anyway. He then invites Sanji to meet them at the flower field. Sanji then worries about Nami's safety but Franky tells him to stop thinking that she is still weak and reminds him that Brook and Chopper are with her.
Sanji then notices a giant television screen broadcasting the fight from the Corrida Colosseum. He is shocked to see Luffy on the screen kicking a gladiator in the face while the announcer expresses his shock at the mysterious gladiator Lucy’s strength. Sanji then tries to inform Franky that Luffy is fighting in the Colosseum but Franky reveals that he let him fight, much to Sanji’s frustration. Sanji then ends his call, and Violet gives Sanji a map to the secret factory. Violet informs Sanji that the factory looks like a toy house up front but it is actually the factory. Sanji expresses concern that Violet will be in a lot of trouble if she keeps helping him but Violet tells him that her superiors are probably already aware of her betrayal. Sanji then tells Violet to meet him at the western port and hide herself so that they can escape later but Violet, amused that Sanji still thinks he can save her, tells him he really is hopeless and smiles before running off.
Suddenly Kin'emon appears out of nowhere and tells Sanji to defeat a group of Doflamingo’s men who were chasing after him. Sanji does so and then comments that Kin'emon could have defeated these small fries himself but Kin'emon said he could not because they used his friend Kanjuro as hostage. He then asks Sanji to come with him to free Kanjuro from a place called the “toy's house”. But he does not know where it is.
Back on Green Bit, in the Tontatta Kingdom, Usopp and the Dwarves are concerned about all the shaking coming from above ground. Robin says that it must be Law and the others. The dwarves then notice that their hero's upset but Usopp says that he is fine and that the shaking was just his Haki. The dwarves are impressed and tell him to keep eating all he wants and call him Usoland. Robin then asks Usopp about why dwarves are calling him Usoland. Usopp shows her a statue with the words ""hero"" on it and asks her if it reminds her of the picture book from Jaya. Robin realizes that the statue is of Mont Blanc Noland. The dwarf Leo says that she is right and tells the story of how Noland came to their island 400 years ago and fought with the bad humans that were ravaging their island and led the dwarves to victory. Flapper then says that he was moved when “Usoland” said Noland’s name and said that he was a descendant of his. Robin looks at Usopp at calls him a bad person but Usopp responds that his lie saved her. The Dwarf chief Gancho then proclaims that Usopp's arrival was due to fate. Leo then says that it was 400 years ago today that Noland led their ancestors to victory and now on the day that they vowed to fight Doflamingo, Usoland the hero showed up. He then says that when Usoland is done eating, they will use an underground tunnel to meet up with their friends on Dressrosa and fight the Donquixote Pirates.

The four are shocked at their appearances and Giolla laughs saying they are a piece of art. Nami demands Giolla to turn them back and Giolla says she will only if they hand over Momonosuke. Nami urges Momonosuke that they won't do that and Giolla, hearing Nami, flings another cloud of art at them. Fortunately, Nami opens the hatch to block the attack and she and the others escape after the smoke clears away. Giolla and the two men wonder where they went and Chopper sneaks by and opens the lower doors allowing Nami, Momonosuke, and Brook to escape.

The standouts among the remaining infamous fighters include Ideo, Jean ""The Bandit"" Ango, the Funk Brothers Kelly and Bobby, the Flower Country's Hasshoken masters and naval warriors Chinjao, Sai and Boo, and finally Lucy, who is becoming a popular underdog.
The audience and commentator Gatz are a mixture of shock and awe by the power and brutality of each fighter's signature skills and techniques, and the question on everybody's mind is which one of these powerhouses will come out on top and earn the right to challenge the other three champions for the Mera Mera no Mi.","Gatz announces with surprise that Hajrudin has been defeated, referring to him as a favored warrior and speaking for everyone when he calls it unexpected. The crowd loves it and starts cheering for Lucy. Meanwhile, Luffy is helping Ucy to safety, saying he is taking the bull to the corner. Cavendish is unimpressed by Luffy's power, while Bartolomeo seems to enjoy the display. Rebecca is completely shocked by Lucy's might. Ideo walks over the unconscious Hajrudin, remarks that the ring is no place for a nap and delivers an explosive punch that propels Hajrudin huge body into the audience stands, panicking spectators before it falls into the water. Gatz was again surprised to see the blasting force of Ideo's punches, referring to him by his epithet ""Destroyer Cannon"". Ideo then declares he will get stronger by eating the Mera Mera no Mi as he blasts away more fighters.
Gatz then turns the crowd's attention to the three fighters from Kano Country, referring to them as famous kenpo users. Sai is then seen shattering a fighter's helmet and shield and knocking him out. Sai is then introduced as the thirteenth leader of the Happo Navy. Gatz refers to the navy's power and centuries of martial experience. Boo is then seen defeating a contender and is introduced as the vice leader of the navy. Chinjao is lastly introduced as the retired twelfth leader of the Happo Navy, while he is being surrounded by a ring of fighters. As the gang attempt to move in on Chinjao, he presses his hands together and knocks out several fighters with Supreme King Haki, stunning the crowd. Other fighters recall his bounty and legendary status as a pirate, and Chinjao turns to them and warns that he is only after one person so they should stay out of his way.
Immediately in front of Chinjao, Jean Ango is seen collecting the weapons of fallen gladiators and thanks Chinjao for incidentally supplying them. He is then introduced as the bounty hunter ""Jean the Robber"". Gatz recalls that Ango is a bounty hunter hated by many pirates in the New World. A fighter charges at him, crying that he won't forgive Ango for sending his partner to jail. Ango simply says that he's a sniper, and the weapons he scavenges are his bullets. He throws a sword clean through the charging man and tells him to attack the prison if he cares so much about his partner, as someone already did two years ago.
Elsewhere, Kelly Funk is mercilessly beating a fighter who is already well past unconsciousness. The crowd dislikes such overkill and shouts at him in disapproval. Bobby tells his brother to stop and tries to grab him but accidentally seizes the victim instead. The brothers are then introduced as killers from the Mogaro Kingdom. Kelly angrily tells his brother the guy he beat up called him a little midget, and asks Bobby for his opinion. Bobby assures him he is not but Kelly once again lays into the unfortunate fighter, and Bobby again grabs the wrong person in an attempt to stop his brother. Kelly finishes his brutal beat down with a threat to gouge the man's eyes out. Gatz mentions that the brothers are notorious in the underworld, adding that the rumor about them is that they were able to handle pirates with bounties exceeding 100,000,000 Beli.
Boo comes up on them, curious to see how a boxer with no formal training fairs against him and immediately sends Kelly Funk flying with a quick jab to the chin. The crowd is stunned by how easily Kelly was sent flying. Gatz once again shows his personal opinion in the commentary, saying that Boo is too strong while one of his booth assistants keeps him from saying more. Boo then turns his sights on Bobby Funk, who reacts fearfully and claims he had never been in a fight, showing his back as Boo swings an axe down on him. To his surprise, the axe shattered, even though he had used Busoshoku Haki to enforce the blade, leaving Boo to wonder how strong Bobby's body is. Bobby tends to his brother, still furious about being mocked for his height, and tells him to ""put it on"". Suddenly, what appears to be a larger, enraged Kelly wearing Bobby's hat turns the tables on Boo, to Sai's consternation, hitting him with a barrage of punches that knocks him unconscious and pummels him on the ground. Gatz cannot tell which brother is actually attacking, guessing that Kelly has transformed into a different person.
Somewhere else, Jean Ango has stolen Luffy's helmet; worrying that his cover is blown, Luffy is forced to use his cape to hide his face and hat. Ango mentions that he heard something interesting about Lucy, and mentioned the rumor that Monkey D. Luffy had snuck into the tournament. Luffy looks to his right and sees Chinjao knocking down fighters to get to him. Gatz announces that about forty people remain in the block, saying it is still anyone's game.","Monkey D.
