        "long_summary": "As Zou begins shaking due to the upcoming Eruption Rain, the Heart Pirates climb on trees while Luffy joins Wanda and Carrot atop Wany's back. At Kurau City, the concerned Straw Hats wonder why Zou is shaking. Wany starts to run as the elephant carrying Zou on its back, Zunesha, lifts up its trunk and spews out a large volume of water onto Zou. The Straw Hats run away, but realize that it is too late to avoid it. Meanwhile, Wany, Wanda, and Carrot are submerged in the raging flood, and eventually emerge from it; they then realize that Luffy has fallen off. They see Luffy flailing in the torrent, and Carrot leaps through tree branches to rescue him. Carrot barely misses Luffy's hand as he sinks underwater and is approached by a shark. Right as Luffy is by the shark's mouth, however, Carrot grabs him and brings him back onto Wany. Meanwhile, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete climb back up to Zou on a cat Kanjuro drew, which they call Nekozaemon. Suddenly, the water from the Eruption Rain comes flowing down, which Bariete explains the source of. Kanjuro reveals that the water will cause Nekozaemon to melt as they are hit by the cascade.\nMeanwhile, Wany swims through the flood, and Wanda explains to Luffy that Zunesha washed itself twice a day by spraying water on its back. The minks took advantage of this by building aqueduct systems to get drinking water, as well as catching fish to eat. Bepo then arrives by swinging through the trees, and tells Luffy to tell Law where he and the Heart Pirates are since he cannot leave the forest. Carrot tells Luffy that although Bepo is a native of this island, he is still a pirate, and so remains under the care of Master Nekomamushi. At Kurau City, the Straw Hats have escaped the flood on the rooftop of a building, although a frightened Usopp has climbed all the way up a tall tower. Usopp expresses his fright at the Eruption Rain (as the shark cruises by, causing him more panic), and as he looks out he spots Luffy riding with Wanda and Carrot. However, Carrot is biting Luffy, and Usopp thinks that they are eating him. Luffy tries to get Carrot off of him, and they pass by some crucifixes in Kurau City. Wanda and Carrot get emotional as they remember Jack torturing a dog mink in order to get information on someone's whereabouts, but the mink refused to tell him. Luffy asks about Jack again, and Wanda reveals that she read his obituary in the newspaper a few days ago. He had attacked four Marine ships transporting Donquixote Doflamingo, and managed to sink two of them, but was ultimately brought down. However, his death could not be confirmed, and Wanda thinks he is still alive, saying that she will never forgive him.\nAs the floodwaters finally drain away, Wanda decides to take a shortcut as Wany picks up its speed. As Luffy expresses excitement at exploring Zou, Law suddenly teleports himself and the Straw Hats right in front of Wany. Usopp attempts to use Zoro's power to threaten the minks into handing Luffy over, but a slightly annoyed Wanda states that they mean no harm and are already at their destination, the Right Belly Fortress. Wanda tells the two guards at the entrance that the Straw Hat Pirates have arrived, surprising them. Inside the Right Belly Fortress, Nami is sleeping on a large sheep mink named Yomo, and Chopper comes to her to reveal that their crewmates are here. Yomo accidentally causes Nami to fall off him as he gets up, but Nami is excited for a reunion. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Law enter the Right Belly Fortress, and receive an unexpectedly warm welcome from the minks. Zoro confides to Wanda that they had thought minks were hostile to outsiders, but Wanda replies that they considered humans to be hairless versions of themselves and did not judge by appearance, but by character. Nami and Chopper then appear, but are stopped by some affectionate minks. The Straw Hats have an emotional reunion as Chopper happily hugs Usopp, but when Luffy mentions Sanji in his greeting, Nami's expression changes as she embraces him. In tears, she begins to reveal something that happened to Sanji.",

The crew members end up in various conflicts and scenarios, with even Nami and Usopp confronting an imposter Straw Hat crew. The Fake Straw Hats eventually, though unknowingly, meet Luffy when he bumps into his own imposter, causing him to fall over and gain an animosity towards the young Pirate captain.",
        "long_summary": "Two years have passed and the episode opens with Luffy reclaiming his straw hat to renew his voyage. The beasts on the island have been tamed by Luffy. Luffy informs Boa Hancock that he is thankful for the food, but he does not want to marry her. On Sabaody Archipelago, Rayleigh and Shakuyaku discuss how time has passed and the pending arrival of the Straw Hat Pirates. Zoro interrupts them and learns that he is the first of the crew to arrive on the island. Meanwhile, Nami is sitting at a bar which happens to be hosting the Fake Straw Hat crew.\nThe scene shifts to Sabaody Park where Brook posters are all over the place. Brook performs his final concert of a world tour. Sanji arrives on the island, locks on to a woman with cross-haired vision, and happily runs from several doting okamas. The Fake Straw Hats ask Nami to join them. Nami refuses their offer saying she is waiting for someone. Fake Luffy gets angry and tries to scare her by saying he is the son of Dragon. Fake Nami approaches Nami and warns her that she has a bounty on her head. Usopp enters and uses his weapon on the Fake Straw Hats. Nami recognizes Usopp and heartily welcomes him. Usopp tells her about the new weapon Pop Green. He gets surprised over seeing Fake Sogeking and even more so for Fake Luffy. Nami uses her weapon from Weatheria to produce a thunder cloud. They casually exit the bar as lightning erupts and does unseen damage. Fake Luffy angrily staggers out of the bar's smoking door. He commands his crew to find and kill them.\nLater, Robin is seen avoiding mysterious pursuers. She wonders out loud about Brook's concert and the Fake Straw Hats recruitment posters. Franky is seen near the Thousand Sunny; it is completely undamaged and he looks forward to setting sail soon. Tony Tony Chopper is seen walking and eating a Grand Bun as he comments that it tastes good. He is happier when he finds a cotton-candy vendor, though. Meanwhile, Fake Luffy encounters a couple resembling Nami and Usopp. He shoots the girl first and then decides to mercilessly shoot the guy she was with when he complains. Luffy strolls into the scene at this time. He is carrying an enormous backpack which bumps into Fake Luffy and causes him to fall over. Fake Luffy's anger is directed at Luffy. The episode ends abruptly with Luffy saying \"Huh?\"",

        "long_summary": "Vice Admiral Garp talked proudly to Ace at Impel Down about some of Luffy's actions, and mentions that they both have the blood of a world class criminal. Ace claims that Whitebeard is his only father since he took care of him after he went wild.\nMeanwhile, on Vice-Admiral Momonga's ship in Boa Hancock's disguise, Luffy is worried about Ace. On the deck of the Marine Ship, Momonga spotted Captain Buggy's ship and it seems familiar to him. The Buggy Pirates spotted a Sea King that emerged adjacent to them and fell back into the sea. The Buggy Pirates were worried about their Captain that was taken away to Impel Down and wanted to free him, but it would be impossible for them to break inside. Alvida suggests that they should take a small boat if they want to get to Impel Down, so they conclude it would be too dangerous for them and quit the breakout attempt.\nPrisoners of Impel Down are being tortured; a new prisoner refuses to obey another prisoner's orders and starts a fight. Minotaurus stopped them and took them both to a different prison cell where they were eaten alive.\nMomonga's ship arrives at Impel Down through the Gate of Justice. Other Marine ships wait at the entrance of Impel Down. With all of the Marine ships, Luffy wonders if someone used a Buster Call. Momonga, Hancock, and Luffy, hidden under Hancock's cloak, departed the ship and enter Impel Down. Hancock struggled to put up with the Marine's love for her, but Momonga politely suggested to her not to petrify them. Around about this time, Buggy the Clown escaped from his cell on Level 1.\nPrisoners inside Impel Down were screaming. Hannyabal greeted Momonga and Hancock at the prison. Hannyabal told Momonga that he wanted to see Warden Magellan of Impel Down. Vice Jail Manager Domino escorts Hancock to a room where she could privately search Hancock as usual with all visitors. Domino took her search on Hancock seriously by making Hancock wear a Seastone handcuff to disable her Devil Fruit powers. Hancock accepted it, but her heart is beating from the tension.",

Meanwhile, in an effort to force him into joining the crew, the Franky Family steal Franky's swim briefs, leading to the destruction of several buildings in Water 7 in the ensuing chase.",
        "long_summary": "After Zambai and the Franky Family beg Luffy to take Franky with them, now that he is wanted, Luffy calmly agrees since he had been seeking a shipwright anyway. But Zambai realizes (after watching him last night) that convincing him will be another matter. Leaving Mozu and Kiwi behind, they proceed towards the Franky House (where Franky is returning right now), saying what they are about to do is a matter between men. As the Straw Hat Pirates prepare to leave, Roronoa Zoro reminds them of their stance regarding Usopp. Urged on by Mozu and Kiwi, they make their way to Scrap Island. At Marineford, Attach the photographer has to explain why Sanji's wanted poster does not have a photo. He shows the original result of his effort a completely black photo. While Attach thinks this to be the result of mystic power, it was because he forgot to take the lens cap off.\nThe Straw Hats arrive to see their new ship enshrouded. Surprisingly, while Iceburg, Paulie, Lulu, Tilestone, and Yokozuna are present (albeit asleep), Franky is not. As he wakes, Iceburg notes Franky did not want to be present at the unveiling, but Franky did leave a message: the King of Pirates should sail a ship graced by the King of Beasts. With a grand flourish, Iceburg unveils their new ship graced with a lion figurehead. Before them stands a brig sloop, at least twice as big as the Going Merry, and packed full of incredible things. Even as the crew take in their new ship, Iceburg conveys something important about Franky. Although he would like more than anything to accompany the Straw Hats on their journey, Franky feels he owes an obligation to Water 7 and in particular to the Franky Family whom he has been training and protecting for years. He is being stubborn, so if they want Franky as a shipwright, they are going to have to get rough.\nThe dirty business is beginning right now as the Franky Family react to Franky relaxing at the Franky House. Despite their best efforts, they cannot hold back tears at what they are about to do. Zambai starts by asking why he will not go with the Straw Hats. Franky points to the shoddily rebuilt Franky House as proof they still need his guidance. Zambai then displays the wanted poster and points out that he is now wanted and cannot stay at Water 7, buy Franky blows it off, wondering if they are using this as a ruse to get rid of him. Suddenly, one of them sneaks up and pulls off his swim briefs. The Franky Family starts running in the direction of Scrap Island with Franky in naked pursuit. As each member falls, he passes the briefs along to the next one ahead. The chase passes through the back streets, with Franky retaliating when he can and causing collateral damage along with cries of indecency from the public. Just as the last member of the Family is about to get caught, he finds Luffy. As he takes the briefs, Luffy thanks Franky for the ship, but Franky continues to demand his briefs back. He finally shoots at Luffy, but Luffy passes the briefs on to Chopper who leads Franky into a trap. Zoro and Sanji grab Franky and stuff him into the Franky Family's Anything-Shot Cannon, which then shoots him towards Scrap Island. He finally comes down legs up for all to see. As he comes to, he turns to see Luffy aboard his new ship, still holding his briefs and saying if he wants them back, he has to join the crew.",

Coribou, Caribou's brother, is digging graves with the rest of the Caribou Pirates.\nIn another scene, Rayleigh remembers when he first met Gol D. Roger, a thought which causes him to shed tears; saying that the Straw Hat indeed looks even better on Luffy.\nMeanwhile, Sentomaru is seen reporting through a Den Den Mushi. He is seen saying that some of the Fake Straw Hat Pirates and the Caribou pirates managed to get away because Rayleigh was blocking their way. He adds that two Pacifistas were severely damaged by the real Straw Hats mentioning that one of the Pacifistas fought against the Straw Hats two years ago. He is seen saying that the power of the Pacifista did not change so he assumes that the Straw hats are back stronger than two years before.\nNext, the Straw Hat Pirates are seen sailing under the sea. At one point, Luffy and Zoro saw fish and were amazed by them. Both plan to eat the fish, but Chopper and Usopp beat them up before they could break the coating bubble. While Chopper and Usopp were yelling at Luffy and Zoro for their bad behavior, Sanji asks Nami how Rayleigh's ship coating works. Nami happily tells him, saying that Rayleigh had given her notes. She turns around and reveals her boobs to Sanji, causing him to suffer a massive nosebleed and fly out of the ship's coating. Robin comments how the coating hasn't broken despite being pierced at such deep pressure. Luffy stretches his arm to grab Sanji back into the ship, combatting the effects of the water on since since he is a devil fruit user. Usopp comments on how Sanji was more more perverted while Brook comments that Sanji might have died, seeing the mermaids on Fish-Man Island as he dreamt to see. Nami later continues her explanation of the coating. The coating is able to handle one pierce but unable to handle multiple. Luffy and Zoro later resume to catching fish, the latter challenging to former on who could catch the most fish. Chopper and Usopp beat up the two again with Usopp scolding the two of not listening to what Nami said. Franky later tells his crew that upon his arrival he saw Bartholomew Kuma protecting the Thousand Sunny. He explains the reason why Hatchan was not there when they departed from the Sabaody to guide them to Fish-Man Island them saying that he was wounded while fighting against the marines so as to protect Thousand Sunny and that the Shichibukai had been protecting the ship for the past two years.\nMeanwhile the Caribou Pirates' plan to kill the real Straw Hat Pirates is revealed as they are traveling through the water as well.

Meanwhile, Jinbe says to Arlong that they need to go and find Fisher Tiger to bring him back safely. Arlong hijacks one of the Marines ships and Jinbe and the others manage to save Tiger. Tiger however, has sustained several injuries with blood all over him from the bullet wounds while Koala is unaware of what happened and her mother not telling her what happened.\nOn the ship they hijacked, Aladine tries to perform a blood transfusion to save Tiger because human blood is the same as fish-man's, but Fisher Tiger refuses to transfuse human blood into his body, stating it has the blood of humans who hate fish-men and that their blood is tainted and he will not give in to humans. Tiger explains to his crew that he was a slave and how he escaped and why he saved all the slaves. He says that both humans as well as fish-men need peace and admits that Otohime was right and that only the children of the next generation like Koala who aren't prejudiced, and asks his crew not to tell the island of what really happened nor of their grudge and hatred towards the humans for the sake of the future. He states that his body would reject that blood due to the demon that dwells inside his heart and he's tried but he just cannot ever love a human. Jinbe and Aladine beg Tiger to live and reassure him of how he's the hero of slaves and the greatest fish-man ever, giving Tiger comfort as he remembers his youth and the episode ends with Fisher Tiger's death and his crew grieving the loss of their beloved captain.",

Luffy succeeds in pulling out only the legs, making everyone think that he killed the man. The legs are revealed to be alive, making the whole group gawk at it. Robin points out that there is no trace of an upper body while Usopp states that he is quite tall. While the crew remains baffled, the legs start to attack them but promptly run away after the unknown Shichibukai. Luffy is then seen calling to it to join his crew, causing Usopp to hit him on the head and telling him to stop it. Luffy runs after and launches himself at the legs, colliding with it and they both falls.\nThe group is barbecuing and eating the dragon meat. Luffy asks Usopp what does one call someone \"like this\" and the latter replies that it is a centaur. It is revealed that the pair of legs is now stuck onto Luffy. Before he can do anything else, the legs lift Luffy up and piledrive him into the ground. Usopp tells Luffy that there must be an upper body in trouble somewhere but Luffy questions where is Usopp's sense of adventure before stating that the legs were born like that. He asks what name does the legs go by when it piledrive him again. Zoro calls to the others from atop a building. He points and the crew realizes they are standing right before a lake, beyond which is a mountain range covered in ice. Usopp and Robin realize that the distress call they received came from the cold side of the island. Luffy is excited by this and wants to eat shaved ice. Usopp, while shouting at Zoro (who, along with Robin, wants to explore the island with Luffy), senses something strange on a nearby chimney. He looks over to see a smiling winged woman staring at him, who then flies off like a bird. Usopp tells the others about what he saw but is not sure about it himself.\nIn a laboratory, a guard walks in to inform the master of having kidnapped Sanji, Nami, Franky and Chopper and the master is very pleased, especially over Franky's cyborg body and chooses to experiment on them later as he tells his men to lock them in a room. Back on the Sunny, Brook, having been left behind due to them believing he was already dead, wakes up while some guards are still on the ship. He questions if the guards know the whereabouts of Nami and the rest but the guards are too shock and shoot at him.\nLater, Franky wakes up to the sound of Sanji kicking the wall and asks what is wrong. Nami tells him it should be obvious and Chopper tells him they are locked up. Franky tries to remember the last thing he did, and Nami assumes that whoever took them must have hit them with sleeping gas, which is confirmed by Sanji. Franky then wonders where Brook is, Nami replies that she doesn't know. Chopper says that if humans are being abducted, then skeletons are not needed. Franky tells Chopper that he isn't human either and Sanji retorts that neither is Franky. From one corner, a voice asks them if they like riddles. The group looks around for the source of the voice, and Chopper jumps back in shock. The voice is from a mouth that is one of eight pieces of a disassembled man's head. The man asks if they could piece him back together. Each member gives it a shot, and they finally get pretty close, having only mixed up the hair and chin, but he admits his gratitude regardless. Chopper asks him why he is alive, and the head says he does not know as he thought himself to be dead when he was cut up by someone and claims he feels shameful for what happened.\nBack at Luffy's group, everyone except Usopp plan to go to the cold side and wonders how do they go about crossing the lake. Usopp is pessimistic about surviving till then and wonder how can Luffy stays in high spirits. Luffy is attacked from behind but he manages to dodge. The attacker is a centaur with leopard legs and they instantly become friends after realizing what they have in common. He apologies to Luffy for mistaking him as an intruder. Zoro and Usopp note that he has made another weird friend.\nAbove them, another person is watching them and counting the numbers. The Den Den Mushi rings and bird woman Usopp saw earlier is asking if the intruders were found. The person answers in the positive and states that they are about to kill them. The bird woman is flying at the cold side of Punk Hazard, pleased.",

        "short_summary": "The Marine Headquarters have started rebuilding, and the Marines had a meeting about Monkey D. Luffy. A Marine ship returned, but does not stop at the bay; instead, it shot at the island and began to circle it. The Marines began firing back, and discovered the ship to be carrying Jinbe, Luffy, and Rayleigh. After completing one circle around Marineford, the three disembark onto the island, with Jinbe and Rayleigh distracting the Marines while Luffy runs to the Ox Bell. While news reporters and other bystanders watch him, Luffy rings the bell sixteen times. He then dropped a bouquet of flowers into the largest crack in the ground, put his straw hat to his chest, and closed his eyes. The reporters excitedly photographed the incident, before Luffy, Rayleigh, and Jinbe leave the island.\nIn a meeting between Fleet Admiral Sengoku and Commander-in-Chief Kong at an unknown location, Sengoku tells his superior that he wants to retire from the Marines, and nominates Aokiji as his replacement. Koby wakes up in hospital, and learns that he now possesses the skill of Haki. Captain Smoker decided to go to the New World to go after Luffy, and asks Aokiji for a transfer to G-5. In the New World, Hawkins is seen being challenged by the pirate Brownbeard, and Eustass Kid is shown killing another pirate crew for displaying weakness and wishing to return to Paradise.",
        "long_summary": "The episode started with a view of Marineford being rebuilt. It showed a room full of vice-admirals as Lieutenant Commander Brannew talked about how Luffy is revealed to have survived the Summit War of Marineford and caused trouble again. A flashback followed, showing what happened two days ago. Two reporters are seen talking about how the Marines will go after the pirates involved in the war. Suddenly, some Marines see the warship which Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh are on. They made a full circle around Marineford before entering the bay (which is done in a funeral). After that, all three of them got to the plaza. Luffy then ran toward the Ox Bell and rang it sixteen times. Afterwards, he went to the largest crack from the battle in the ground and dropped a bouquet of flower in it and held his hat to his chest in a manner of paying respect. Reporters who were at the scene excitedly took photographs of the incident. Soon afterwards, a huge whale-shark appeared in the bay as Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh escaped from Marineford. After that, the newspapers printed the story and delivered it to all around the world, including Water 7, Sabaody Archipelago, Arabasta, and Foosha Village. The flashback ends as Brannew stated that it is humiliating for them to have let Luffy go.\nAfter that there was a scene showing the Five Elders discussing who should fill the vacancies in the Shichibukai positions and that Blackbeard was turning out to be a lot of trouble. They also comment on how those with the \"D\" are beginning to stir up trouble at the same time.\nThe next scene showed World Government Commander-in-Chief Kong and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku discussing Sengoku's retirement. Sengoku also recommended Admiral Aokiji to be the next Fleet Admiral.\nThe scene changed to Koby, Helmeppo, and a doctor in the hospital, discussing how Koby has obtained Observation Haki. Koby, talking within himself states that he feels different with this new power and he has to train more to become stronger; as strong as \"him\" (\"him\" referring to Luffy).\nAfter that, Admiral Aokiji and Smoker talked about what Luffy did at Marineford and about Smoker's transfer to the Marine base G-5.\nIn the New World, Eustass Kid and his crew were talking about Luffy's actions. Kid asked what the Ox Bell is. Killer explained what it is and the reason he thinks why Luffy rang it sixteen times.\nThe scene changes to Capone Bege's ship, which was being pulled up to a huge black ball in the sky, and Urouge's ship, which was approaching an island that was constantly being hit by lightning. An old woman offered to sell the crew some umbrellas. It then goes back to Kid as he declared that he will defeat Luffy in the New World.",

        "long_summary": "The Marines of the Buster Call are stunned by the announcement of Rob Lucci's defeat. The thought of a pirate able to defeat one believed to be the most powerful, most ruthless Agent of the World Government fills all of them with dread at just what the Straw Hat Pirates are capable of performing. On the other side, the Straw Hats and their ally Franky are all reinvigorated by Luffy's victory, and they begin the push to clear the way for their escape. Suddenly, the Den Den Mushis are filled with voices of congratulations. Usopp suddenly stops and tries to track something with his ears: something familiar. To Franky's joy and relief, the voices are Zambai and the Franky Family along with Paulie and the Dock 1 shipwrights. While they had been surprised by a Buster Call attack and knocked over the edge, Paulie had used his Rope Action to throw up a net. The giants Oimo and Kashii had endured the brunt of the attack, allowing everyone to survive. With the Buster Call focused on the Straw Hats, Zambai assures them they can get away.\nEventually, the Vice-Admirals get the Marines over the shock and the fight resumes on the Bridge of Hesitation. But the Straw Hats and Franky continue their stubborn defense. So, the Buster Call decides to zero in on Luffy: too tired to even move from the spot where he fell in victory. Usopp is the first among the Straw Hats to realize Luffy's problem. First, the Marines destroy the escape ship. Thankfully, Sanji had evacuated Chopper, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe from it before the attack hit. The Straw Hats soon realize the Buster Call is redoubling its efforts and strategically cornering them: even at the expense of their own men. Eventually, they're isolated on the second column: unable to reach Luffy in the first column while the battleships take aim. Just then, Usopp hears that voice again. Soon the rest of the Straw Hats hear it, too, telling them to look down. Usopp finally recognizes it and proposes a bold gambit: jump into the sea. All the Straw Hats wonder what he could be thinking, particularly given Luffy, Robin, and Chopper's mutual problem with the sea. But Usopp insists they jump anyway: they have a friend down there. Once Robin conveys Luffy off the column with Cien Fleur: Delphinium, everyone else jumps. And to their amazement, a friend does wait below them, ready to receive them: the Going Merry.",

The marines then attempt to shoot at Luffy, but Boa Hancock intervenes and stops them with her Slave Arrow move. Garp, Luffy's grandfather, continues shouting that Luffy must kill him in order to pass.\nLuffy then has a flashback of a training session where he attempts to continuously ward off fighting monkeys, but eventually gets tired and then asks his grandfather, \"Why do I have to keep fighting them, it only makes me hungry\". Garp says, \"So that you'll be a strong marine soldier\". Luffy defiantly shouts that he wants to be a pirate.\nAs he continues running, Luffy has yet another flashback, again training. This time he is attacking a Gorilla, but fails to hit the Gorilla. He attempts a Gomu-Gomu no move, but fails and snags his arm into a near-by tree. Garp helps him down and fixes his straw hat. As his grandfather does so Luffy says, \"I'm going to become a pirate, not just a pirate, the Pirate King\". Angered by his statements Garp becomes frustrated and blames Red-haired Shanks for influencing Luffy into becoming a pirate and thus dismisses the Gorilla saying, \"I must beat some character into my grandson\".

With no way back, the two decide to capture the ship Spandam had intended to use to bring Robin to the Marine headquarters. Unfortunately, Vice-Admiral Doberman, one of the respondents to the Buster Call, arrives. His battleship takes a shot at the stockade and blows a hole in it. The next attack by Doberman is shooting at the Tower of Justice, causing its already broken upper half to crush down into the waterfall. Usopp narrowly escapes as it crashes into the abyss below and demolishes the damaged drawbridge with it. Zoro and Sanji realize that because the Gates of Justice are fully open, the waterfalls surrounding the island have vanished because the water current no longer has to go around them. This will allow the battleships to take a clear path into Enies Lobby. The resulting loud noise created reaches Luffy and Rob Lucci beneath the Bridge of Hesitation. Luffy's use of Gear 2 begins to take a toll on him. He pants heavily throughout its activation, and then Gear 2 completely wears off during his fight. Lucci figures out Luffy is doping his blood by using his legs as pumps\u2014a move that would cause a normal person's heart to explode from the excess blood pressure. It is a move only Luffy can use due to the resilience of his unique rubber inner organs, but it risks shortening his lifespan. Luffy does not care about the damage he is doing to his body if CP9 is going to tear apart his life by taking his friends away, and yells at Lucci for making light of his crew's dire situation as if it were a game. Anticipating that the Straw Hats would emerge through the underground passage, Lucci tears a hole into a wall of the underwater chamber, flooding it and the passage. Meanwhile, Nami catches up to Kokoro, the unconscious Chopper, Chimney, and Gonbe in the passageway, with Zoro and Sanji about to do the same, none knowing a torrent of water is headed straight for them. Spandam desperately calls on all the Marines he can find to save his skin and try to stop Robin from escaping, but she and Franky easily defeat the reinforcements. However, both sides are now out of time. From the horizon, the rest of the Buster Call ships arrive and target the entire island, only ignoring Nico Robin on orders from Admiral Aokiji. Oimo and Kashii flee Enies Lobby with the Galley-La shipwrights and the Franky Family in tow as cannon fire wastes the judicial island.

Hody Jones is seen briefly during his youth, wishing he could have seen it for himself.\nThe Sun Pirates are attacked by a Marine battleship led by Kadar who demands the fish-men return all the slaves Tiger had freed, only to be brutally assaulted by the angry fish-men, who reprimand the Marines for worrying more about reclaiming Celestial Dragon slaves rather than stopping slavery. The fish-men take all their belongings and Arlong secretly kills one of the Marines.\nVice Admiral Kizaru receives reports of the dangerous Sun Pirates and later issues the two most dangerous members, Jinbe and Tiger bounties. Back on the ship, Tiger scolds Arlong for killing the Marine and makes a speech about liberation and freedom over revenge, but later tells Jinbe that \"demons\" he has inside of him wishes he could kill humans.\nThe Sun Pirates then get asked to escort a scruffy human slave, Koala to her hometown, which Tiger grudgingly accepts. During their time with Koala, Arlong beats her for being a human and the crew are shocked at her demeanor and fear of them, taking pity on her. Tiger finally removes her slave mark and replaces it with a sun. Koala then finally shows emotion by crying.",

        "long_summary": "The story now goes 15 years into the past, as Neptune, holding a baby Shirahoshi, comments on how Tiger's actions will stop Fish-Man Island from attending the World Summit for a while. Otohime comments that they could never have stopped him after hearing the voice in his heart. Tiger's attack on Mary Geoise is spread throughout the whole island and everyone celebrates his attack and freeing the slaves, calling him the hero of Fish-Man Island. Otohime tries to get others to sign her petition for migrating to the human world, only to be turned down by the people due to them celebrating Fisher Tiger and his attack and they all leave. At the Fish-Man District a young Hody Jones and New Fish-Man Pirates all comment on Tiger's attack, wishing to have joined them. They cheer them on believing that their goal is killing humans.\nAt the Sun Pirates, Hachi tells the boss that there is a Marine ship coming and the crew prepare for battle. Arlong leads the attack and the Marines are having a hard time attacking them due to them being underwater. Rear Admiral Kadar demands that they return the slaves and the Marines are being attacked under the ship. A Marine states to Jinbe that it's a crime for freeing slaves and that the Fish-Men should never go against humans. Jinbe, enraged, brutally assaults the human and asks why freeing slaves is a crime while slavery is not a crime and asks Otohime if this is the peace they can have with humans. Tiger begins his attack on the Marines and Kadar demands that he gives back the slaves only for Tiger to defeat him with a kick and ask what slaves are on the ship, stating that if they have a slave mark, then they should be found but due to the sun mark they cannot tell which is which. Tiger declares he will not have them killed, but will take their belongings and Arlong tries to kill a human for stating that being a human is sinful and Tiger tries to stop him but is too late.\nAt Marineford, Vice Admiral Borsalino is hearing a report from Rear Admiral Strawberry, about the crew and how powerful they are, for defeating Kadar and how dangerous they are in the water. Back at the Sun Pirates, Tiger is scolding Arlong for killing that Marine despite his protests. Jinbe states that they are out to kill the crew and they have to step up to be ready for them. Tiger states that killing them will make them as bad as the humans, stating this is not for revenge and neither what he did at Mary Geoise. He states that the Sun Pirates are about freedom and liberation and that they will never kill anyone. Arlong protests stating they should kill humans to make an example out of them and scare them only for Jinbe to punch him in the head for disobedience. At night, Tiger has a private talk with Jinbe and tells him that the \"demons\" that dwell within his heart are the most terrifying. Over time, as Otohime continues to try gaining supporters for her petition, Tiger and Jinbe gain bounties of 230 million and 76 million, respectively.\nThree years later, on an island, Tiger would be asked by the people to take a former slave named Koala home and agreed while Koala would thank Tiger for what he did. Arlong is disgusted for having a human on board and assaults her for constantly smiling while Hachi holds him back. She gets up and rips some of her pants and starts cleaning the deck while blood is coming out of her nose, confusing the crew and even Arlong. Jinbe asks what she's doing and she just continually apologizes and states she will not stop working and will not cry so she will not be killed. Jinbe is shocked and takes pity on how traumatized she is and realizes how afraid she is of them because she wants to go home. Aladine states that she's acting like this because she may have seen other slaves been killed for taking breaks or not smiling and thinks she cannot trust anyone. Tiger decides to take her to his room and marks her with the sun symbol stating while it's harsh, she cannot forget the fact she was once a slave but can hide the mark. She later wakes up and apologizes for passing out, but did not cry, causing Tiger to yell stating it's alright to cry, stating they are not like the stupid World Nobles. He takes a gun and throws it overboard to prove a point and states that they will not kill anyone and tells his crew that they'll take her home no matter what, causing Koala to finally cry.",

        "short_summary": "After Fisher Tiger's death, Arlong, enraged, betrays his last wishes and decides to attack and kill the villagers of Koala's village for selling him out, upon trying he is easily beaten by Vice-Admiral Borsalino and taken into Marine custody for interrogation, where Arlong tells the marines a lie of Tiger's death, which Jinbe later notes, to preserve his honor as a fish-man.\nJinbe sends a letter to Neptune and Otohime to tell them about Tiger's death and Otohime continues to try to gather signatures for her petition, but after a short time, many of the citizens and their children take back their previous signatures which leads to her going back to the palace, only to stay in a drunken depression whilst ranting about her ambitions, broadcasting it to the entire country which changes the views of some citizens.\nJinbe receives an invitation to the Shichibukai and accepts to further bolster the relations between humans and fish-men species (for Otohime) and to watch the World Government and demands that Arlong be released.\nUpon his return, Arlong states he's leaving the Sun Pirates to make his own Arlong Pirates who will wreak havoc upon the East Blue and challenges Jinbe to stop him, Jinbe loses his temper with him and beats him to a bloody pulp, but leaves him alive and demands his crew removes him before he changes his mind.\nThe crew then splits into three, with the Arlong Pirates and Macro Pirates splitting away from the original crew as the episode ends.",
        "long_summary": "Arlong is enraged over Tiger's death and, rather than choosing to obey Tiger's last wish, he does the exact opposite of what Tiger wanted: as he returns to Koala's home island, he plans to get revenge on the humans that sold him out. However, Vice-admiral Borsalino is there and easily defeats Arlong. Arlong states he's here to kill all the humans that sold Tiger out and how Tiger is now dead while Borsalino just states now he's gonna take him with him. At the G-2 Base, Arlong is being interrogated and yells how if not for human's blood being the cause of Tiger's death he would still be alive and states that humans killed Fisher Tiger. The next day Jinbe is reading the newspaper and notes how Arlong left out several details and lied to the Marines. Aladine states he did so that Tiger's reputation and pride would stay safe. Jinbe, agreeing with Aladine, states that they have to continue on now and prepare for battle and states that they will not kill anyone. At Marineford, Strawberry tells Borsalino about how dangerous Jinbe is.\nAt the palace, Neptune and Otohime are reading a letter from Jinbe about the truth of Tiger and how they support Otohime's cause. Otohime gains more confidence and strives to gain more peace with humans and merfolk. She continues to gain more signatures, but the citizens are even more distrusting towards humans due to the news about Tiger and how they just cannot trust humans because of this. After the day, Shirahoshi at age 4 and the princes comfort her from her long day. Jinbe goes on to state how she continued to save humans and teach children about the outside world and continuing to gain more signatures. One day, a citizen asks how many signatures Otohime has. Otohime states there are 5 million people on the island and she only has 1,000 signatures, but still has a long way to go. The citizen and others ask for their signatures back, and so do some of the children having been told so by their parents. They state that they listen to her because she's queen, but it's the humans and cannot live with them and are tired of her speeches. They take all the signatures and the Minister of the Right can only take pity on the queen. At the palace, Otohime returns and is crying to herself with Neptune listening in depression. The next day, Otohime, drunk, makes a broadcast announcement for the whole island about how they choose to live on the bottom of the surface because of how there's a little light and air to live off of. She goes on to state how the children sneak off to view the outside world and how the people of the island are afraid of change for the world and if they can change that, then maybe they can see all the true wonders of the world. This seems to have an effect on the people.\nOne day, Jinbe receives a message from the World Government about becoming a Shichibukai. Macro states that because his bounty is now at 250 million and they are afraid of him. Jinbe actually decides to take them up on this offer. At the palace, Jinbe is speaking with Neptune about his decision to become a Shichibukai to promote peace for merfolk and Neptune is grateful, stating Otohime would appreciate this and this is what Tiger would have wanted, however, Hody Jones does not like this.\nJinbe decides to have Arlong released from Impel Down and the crew all rejoice that he's back. Arlong decides to leave since Jinbe is now a dog of the government and will take his Arlong Pirates to do what he wants and if Jinbe wants to stop him, he will have to kill him and yells that he will become the rage of Fish-Men. Jinbe, finally losing his temper with Arlong, brutally beats him half-dead with his fists, but, due to everything they've been together, cannot bring himself to kill him and lets him go. Aladine reassures him that if Arlong decides to do anything funny, they'll be there to stop him while Jinbe shows his frustration on how Arlong cannot understand Tigers wish. The episode ends with Arlong's and Macros crew leaving the Sun Pirates.",

Rebecca was the only one to saw what really happened during the fight. Cavendish fell asleep in the midst of the fighting, but before the other fighters could take advantage, Cavendish woke up with a sinister face, and moved as fast as the wind, cutting down every fighter. Rebecca dodged a fatal strike from Cavendish, who then fell asleep again. Outside the Colosseum, Vice Admiral Bastille explains that Cavendish's actions is, in fact, the actions of his alter ego Hakuba, who is notorious for his speed. At the palace, Doflamingo boasts to King Riku that Luffy is trapped in the Colosseum, and his men will stop the Straw Hat Pirates. Unbeknownst to Doflamingo, Robin and Usopp infiltrate the basement harbor, and elsewhere, Luffy's group runs into Viola who wants to help them break into the palace.",
        "long_summary": "In the D block battle, after 20 contestants are knocked out, Gatz sees that someone is attempting to stand in the middle of the block, and that person is Rebecca. As it is announced that Rebecca is the block winner, the crowd begins booing her claiming that she must have cheated. Meanwhile, at the prisoner gladiator quarters, Rebecca's friends cheer for her victory.\nOutside the Colosseum, Vice Admiral Bastille tells a marine about the Kamaitachi of Rommel. He says that sometime ago in the kingdom of Rommel a strange wind was blowing during the night, that had the power to cut people up. After a series of mysterious events, the Marines decided to send a battle ship to investigate the matter. Many Marines lost their lives to that \"wind\" but they finally managed to find out that the culprit behind the wind was actually a man named Hakuba. Despite not being able to capture him, they deduced that Hakuba appears in the towns where a certain pirate stops.\nIn the Colosseum, Rebecca sees Cavendish unconscious before her and she remembers that as she was fighting Suleiman in the battle, suddenly Cavendish fell asleep. The other gladiators noticed this and took the opportunity to take him out. As they were about to attack him, Cavendish woke up with a sinister expression and slashed all the other gladiators so fast, that they didn't even see him coming. However, Rebecca was able to see through his movements and barely managed to avoid his strike, which hit her helmet instead. Cavendish then fell asleep again returning to his normal form.\nBack outside the Colosseum, Bastille continues with his explanation about Hakuba, telling the soldiers that Cavendish turns into Hakuba when he falls asleep and that Hakuba was the one who went out to sea after committing various crimes. The other Marines start sympathizing with Cavendish, but Bastille corrects them saying that Cavendish actually enjoys the popularity his alter ego offers him. Finally, Bastille notes that while Cavendish is a strong swordsman, Hakuba is even better than him in terms of strength and speed and it's just unfortunate for him that Cavendish's ability doesn't work well in a match-style fight.\nIn the Colosseum the crowd accuses Rebecca of secretly carrying a gun. Lucy who was watching this, next to Bartolomeo, says that it probably wasn't just luck that allowed Rebecca to avoid those attacks, but anyways he wouldn't let anyone touch the Mera Mera no Mi.\nIn the palace, Doflamingo and the captured Riku Doldo III are observing the outcome of the battles. Doflamingo is certain that Luffy won't make it out of the Colosseum and that Franky, who is causing a ruckus at the moment, will be defeated by his associates. He states that their only pieces left are Zoro, Kin'emon, Robin and Sogeking. An unconscious Law is shown chained to the heart seat.\nLuffy, Zoro and Kin'emon reach the palace's entrance, as Wicca revealed that it was one of the ways to enter the factory. There, they met Viola who claimed that she was waiting for them to lead them inside the palace.",

Both Koby and Helmeppo are greatly shocked at Luffy's action and comment on how the admirals will kill him. The ice shards resulting from Aokiji's defense create a fog, which Luffy uses to activate Gear Second and pass through the admirals. His efforts are futile as Kizaru kicks him at lightspeed. Sengoku then orders for Ace to be executed, much to the surprise of Whitebeard, Jinbe, Marco and the commanders. However, the executioners are struck by Crocodile's sand, shocking and angering Sengoku. When confronted, he claimed \"he does not want them to taste victory\" and his head is then sliced by Donquixote Doflamingo, who claimed he is \"jealous that he joined with Whitebeard\". Crocodile soon recovers, and both fight as Crocodile claims he \"will team up with nobody\". Luffy is then attacked by hordes of Marines, and defeats a high ranking Marine with ease. Akainu is about to intercept Luffy but Aokiji pins Luffy down, and claims he owed a favor to Garp, but that Luffy has chosen \"his own path of death\". Boa Hancock wants to interfere, but Marco proves to be faster and kicks Aokiji away. Galdino, who has infiltrated deep inside Marineford, believes he is being chased by the Marines when an alert is announced and falls in panic. The Whitebeard Pirates decide to swim across the boiling water toward Oars Jr. and Sengoku is immediately alerted. In a desperate attempt, high ranking Marines give the order to shoot cannon balls at them, but the lower ranking Marines begin to panic as the pirates keep advancing without hesitation. Soon after a hidden coated ship appears and takes the pirates in, much to the Marines' surprise and Sengoku's annoyance. The Marines order to shoot down the ship, but it is too fast. Sengoku orders them to shoot at Oars, but he is already able to pull the ship out of the water, allowing the pirates a safe pass through the plaza. Garp soon commends Whitebeard for his tactics and Oars is gunned down and falls unconscious, telling Whitebeard to save Ace. Whitebeard enters the plaza, and unleashes a massive shock wave with his weapon. Whitebeard orders his pirates to save Ace and destroy the Marines. Knowing that Whitebeard is about to attack with all his forces, both Sengoku and Garp decide to fight.",

        "long_summary": "Shanks stands firm before Akainu while Garp recognizes the former for corrupting his grandson into being a pirate. Almost all the pirates and Marines are surprised, while an amused Teach catches notice. The Red-Haired Pirates had arrived. While Law's submarine sails away, his crew members race to save Luffy and Jinbe who are rapidly losing blood. As they prepare for transfusion, Bepo reminds his captain they need to go underwater soon. The Marines learn that Shanks' crew had a run-in with one of the other Four Emperors, Kaido, yesterday. Buggy freaks out at seeing Shanks, as the latter is surprised to see him but the clown pirate doesn't want to be in Shanks' presence. Shanks throws his straw hat to Buggy for the clown to loan to Luffy. The clown pirate yells that he doesn't want anymore favors from the red-haired pirate. Shanks also says he has got a treasure map that could suit Buggy fancy. When Shanks moves to give the map to another, Buggy quickly decides to comply to his former crewmate's request and get the Straw Hat to Luffy. Lucky Roux wonders if Shanks is going to let Luffy leave without a chance to greet him.\nWith their times flying by, Shanks thinks back to his first meeting with Luffy, and how he sacrificed his arm to save him from the Sea King. He begins to wonder what Luffy would say at their moment. Bepo calls to Law for attention as they don't want the Marines to hit their submarine hard, or for the captain to drown. Buggy then races with the Straw Hat and slings it into Law's hand. The pirate surgeon and Bepo head inside the submarine and it begins to submerge. With the two racing to Luffy's side, Shanks knows that his reunion with Luffy will have to wait. He also thinks back to when he gave his Straw Hat to Luffy and expects it returned in good condition and will meet whence Luffy becomes a great pirate. Once the submarine submerges, Shanks says he can't see Luffy again just yet. Law begins his operation as Akainu ran both Jinbe and Luffy through, but is more worried about the emotional scars that Luffy has suffered.\nMeanwhile, Akainu curses Shanks for allowing Luffy's escape while his comrades are determined to finish Luffy with Aokiji firing an Ice Age, threatening to freeze the water. With Luffy's pulse steadying, the submarine is struck, but Jean Bart makes the submarine go full speed for a dive. Just as the ice is inches from giving the submarine a fatal blow, it evades. Bepo breathes a sigh of relief. However, Kizaru fires a Yasakani Sacred Jewel shower, rocking the submarine heavily. Hancock tries to protest. When he stops, the light admiral says that if Law's group survived, luck may not be on the side of the Marines. Hancock hijacks a Marine ship and tells the crew she will capture Luffy on her authority as a Warlord. Shanks stares at the horizon as Luffy leaves the area.\nBuggy lashes out at Shanks as the treasure map was all a trick. The Red Haired Pirate Captain says he was just having fun with his old friend and is happy to see him again. The Clown pirate reacts angrily to this and reminds Shanks that if he hadn't spotted him with the Bara Bara no Mi or the map, he would not lose it. Buggy yells that Shanks is a prodigy when it comes to making him angry. He also declares war on Shanks, as his impressed followers internally promise to serve him forever. Shanks leaves Buggy to handle his business with the war, as Buggy protests this but soon realizes he could hitch a ride with Shanks' crew to safely leave Marineford.\nShanks walks past Marco, informing him that there is no further need for combat and he must resign. Mihawk walks past the Marines as they protest, he firmly tells them while he agreed to fight Whitebeard's crew, Shanks was another matter telling the Marines to quit and he leaves the area. Shanks warns to everyone present on Marineford that their fighting is becoming pointless. Every blow one party lands, it goes back to their own as well. He draws his sword as he tells them that if anyone wants another fight, the red-haired pirate dares the pirates and marines to fight him. The Marines are in shock, while Teach's crew stands in idle. Shanks confronts Teach and asks if he wants to escalate things. An amused Teach compliments Shanks for the scars that he left on Shanks' eye. Just as both crews prepare to duel, Teach laughs as he announces to his crew to resign. He declares he already had what he wanted and doesn't wish for another fight with Shanks, at least not yet. The Blackbeard pirates pull out and leave the area.\nSengoku shifts back to his human form and Shanks sheathes his sword. With Ace and Whitebeard dead, Shanks tells everyone to accept the losses, honor the fallen and leave with their dignity intact. Whitebeard's crew mourn the loss of their captain and the Marines tend to their fallen. At Sabaody, Reuder remarks that the war seems to be ending.\nShanks requests that Ace and Whitebeard be given a proper burial and doesn't want their corpses paraded through like trophies. With the Marines ultimately victorious, they want to string their dead enemies up as proof of their triumph. However, Sengoku consents and allows Shanks to give Ace and Whitebeard the proper burial, something that the pirate thanks. Sengoku then orders the injured to be tended to and announces the war is finally over. As the wounded are gathered, Garp orders the soldiers not to lose anymore good men while he sheds tears at his loss.\nShanks then looks upon the bodies of Ace and Whitebeard as he sadly looks on.",

Luffy confirms this and tells them his name. A bifurcation is in their way and Nami tells everyone to follow her, but Luffy goes the other way, as he was watching his brother fight. The Straw Hats arrive at the ship and carry all the supplies, only to notice that Luffy is missing. Luffy is sitting on the barrel he was carrying in an alley, but he does not know where his crew went. Ace greets him from the top of a house in the alley and then comes down. They start arm wrestling on top of the barrel Luffy was sitting on, but after struggling, the barrel breaks and the water inside it scatters. They both agree that they are equally strong. Ace invites Luffy and his crew to join the Whitebeard Pirates, but Luffy declines.\nOn Smoker's ship, Mr. 11 is left alone, tied to the mast. Some Billions get on the deck and Mr. 11 asks them to untie him. They explain that as Billions, they are candidates to be promoted to Officer Agents. Mr. 11 asks them to untie him again, but they shoot him. The Billions get off the ship and someone informs them that Fire Fist Ace is in the town. One of them then comments that if they take down Ace, they will surely be promoted to Officer Agents.\nLuffy and Ace start searching for Luffy's crew, but as they walk, Billions start to surround them without being noticed. After they are gathered, everyone comes out. Luffy and Ace do not care what they say and keep walking but the Billions start a fight. After Luffy sends the leader flying with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, one of the Billions tells his comrades not to be scared by that, and everyone keeps chasing them again. Luffy spots his ship and stretches his arms in order to reach for it. He enters the ship ramming towards Sanji and Chopper. Ace reaches the ship in his boat, but then they spot five Billions ships coming towards them. Ace tells Luffy that he can handle them, gets in his boat, and starts propelling it with the help of his flames. He then jumps over a ship and when he lands, he launches a Hiken, destroying the five ships consecutively.\nSmoker is talking to Tashigi and asks what Nefertari Vivi was doing with the Straw Hats. Tashigi proposes that perhaps she was a hostage to a major scheme, but Smoker does not think so. He thinks that is unlikely since she was getting along with the group as if she was one of them. He says that something big is going to occur and that he may know where they are heading after Luffy told him he only wanted to beat Crocodile. Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper in the Going Merry are toasting for Ace joining the Straw Hats, but Ace tells them he is not joining them. After that, he explains that he is in search for Blackbeard after he killed one of his crewmates. He also explains that he is heading to Yuba, and Nami tells him that they are going to the same place. Vivi proceeds to explain the route and after that, they toast for having a fun time together.",

Doflamingo and Moria are excited for battle, but Mihawk and Hancock stay quiet. Hancock is disgusted by the hot headed men, with the exception of Luffy who she prays is alright.\nThe water levels strangely recede. To this same affect Luffy's ship is pulled back from the Gates of Justice, and Jinbe is the only one who realizes why. Luffy panics, but Jinbe assures him that they'll make it on time, to Buggy's disbelief. In an apparently miraculous turn of events, the water rushes forward pushing them quickly ahead. However a large shadow suddenly looms over the ship.\nWe cut back to Marineford to a tense standoff between the pirates and marines. The water levels rise, and off in the distance, giant waves are spotted. The waves look like they are about to drown the whole of Marineford, but Aokiji jumps up and freezes them with his Hie Hie no Mi's power, \"Ice Age\". He attacks Whitebeard with ice arrows that Whitebeard quickly disposes of along with hitting Aokiji. Aokiji breaks into pieces and falls toward the water which he quickly freezes as well. It traps all the ships in the bay, but the pirates use the frozen water as a foothold and charge forth. The marines also start their attack and everything quite quickly dissolves into all out battle, Smoker and Tashigi included. The admirals show their faces, although the men tell Tsuru she can just sit back and relax. She ignores them, telling them it did not matter how far back she went, there was no escaping this fight.\nSquard, one of Whitebeard's loyalist supporters, tells his own crew to charge forth. Meanwhile it seems the Seven Warlords are finally ready to get involved. Surprisingly, it is Mihawk who seems ready to jump into battle. It appears he wants to see the distance between Whitebeard and himself. Although there are others, such as Vista who would also like to test themselves against \"The World's Greatest Swordsman\". Mihawk unsheathes his meito sword, \"Yoru\" and slashes it at Whitebeard.",

A Marine attempts to attack Caribou with a sword without success, meanwhile, discovering his possession of a Logia Devil Fruit which he uses to smother the Marine before shooting him.\nJust when it seems like the battle will end in the Impostor Straw Hats favor (with the fake Luffy announcing that the one who kills the most Marines will become his right-hand man), 2 Pacifistas arrive along with Sentomaru. PX-5 identifies Luffy from a long distance. Lip Doughty fails in an attempt to attack PX-7 and is defeated and captured by the Marines. Terrified, the Fake Straw Hats run away, only for fake Luffy to collide right into Sentomaru. When all the pirates see him, they think he is going to fight and show them his power. Sentomaru is confused as to why the pirates are calling him \"Big Boss\" and \"Straw Hat\". Then fake Luffy starts bragging about \"being\" Luffy, proclaiming that he is the son of Dragon, the grandson of Garp, that he was in the War of the Best, and about having a 400,000,000 bounty on his head only to get cut off by Sentomaru who smashes him over the head with his iron axe whilst yelling that Luffy is not a piece of trash like him. Sentomaru asks PX-5 to identify who he really is, revealing him to be Demaro Black, a low-ranking pirate with a bounty of 26,000,000. Everyone is shocked to learn that he's an impostor while the rest of the Fake Straw Hats run off. Upon hearing about his doppelganger, Luffy decides to get out before getting caught.\nPX-5 locates Luffy and is given an order by Sentomaru to attack him. Luffy avoids the Pacifista's attack, with his disguise falling off in the process. Everyone takes a good look at him and they all realize he is the actual Luffy, which shocks the Fake Straw Hats when they realize who they were threatening. Sentomaru says that he has become a Marine officer and arrived to arrest Luffy. PX-5 attempts to attack Luffy again, but Luffy avoids all of its attacks. Then, by using Haki and Gear Second, he completely destroys PX-5 prior to running away.\nWhile running away he comes across the actual Zoro and Sanji. Sentomaru orders PX-7 to attack them, only for them to simultaneously defeat him, shocking the recruits of the fake Straw Hats, making them realize they are indeed the real deal. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji all start running together towards the Thousand Sunny. Luffy stops for a moment because he senses Rayleigh. Luffy thanks him for everything he has done for him in the past 2 years and yells that he is definitely going to become the Pirate King making Rayleigh look at him and smile.",

        "long_summary": "Big Mom contacts Kaidou through Den Den Mushi, telling him that she would be visiting Wano Country to personally kill Luffy. Kaidou objects, claiming that his grudge against Luffy was greater. Kaidou had previously operated a SMILE fruit operation with Donquixote Doflamingo, but Luffy destroyed the factory, ending the operation. Kaidou wanted to be the one to personally kill Luffy. However, Big Mom refuses to back down, suggesting that they form an alliance against him.\nMeanwhile, in New Marineford, the Marines manage to wiretap the call, learning about the Emperors' plans to kill Luffy in Wano Country. Kizaru suggests Marine intervention, but Sakazuki refuses, since Wano Country was not part of the World Government and was thus outside their jurisdiction.\nGarp has a conversation with Hina on the matter, and tells the story of Luffy's adventures after the Marineford War. Immediately after the war concluded, Luffy returned to Marineford and rang the Ox Bell, signalling the beginning of a new era and hinting at his crew members to meet again in two years. The Straw Hats trained separately, reunited at Sabaody two years later, and resumed their adventures.\nGarp continues the story. The Straw Hats reached Fish-Man Island to cross the Red Line. After defeating Hody Jones and thwarting their coup d'\u00e9tat against the Ryugu Kingdom, Luffy would personally pick a fight with Big Mom herself. He would continue his adventures in Punk Hazard. During his struggle against mad scientist Caesar Clown, Luffy formed an alliance with Trafalgar Law of the Heart Pirates, planning to take down another Emperor, Kaidou. On his next adventure, Luffy infiltrated Dressrosa and clashed against its tyrannical king, Donquixote Doflamingo. During this struggle, not only did Straw Hat put an end to Kaidou's SMILE fruit operation, seven powerful crews would join Straw Hat's army.\nLuffy continued onto the island of Zou. There, the Mink tribe and the Kouzuki Family would both join Luffy's alliance with Law to take down Emperor Kaidou. However, Sanji was forced to split away from the crew due to a political marriage. The crew would split into two groups, of which Luffy's group went to Totto Land to fight against the Big Mom Pirates and rescue Sanji. Luffy dealt a heavy hit to the Big Mom Pirates because he destroyed Big Mom's castle, foiled a political marriage and an assassination attempt, and took down their most formidable fighter, Katakuri. Although the Straw Hats escaped Totto Land, Big Mom continues to pursue Luffy for revenge.\nBack in present day, Shanks infiltrates Pangaea Castle and speaks with the Five Elders. He wishes to speak to them about a certain pirate.",

        "long_summary": "The Big Mom Pirates's head chef Streusen leads several other cooks in making the wedding cake for the upcoming wedding, singing a song connecting the cooking to life in the process. At the eastern inlet of Whole Cake Island, Pekoms is kept under the watch of the Sun Pirates. Aladine assures him that Jinbe has reported Bege's treachery to Big Mom, and his crewmates readily back him up, but this only causes Pekoms to grow suspicious, and the Sun Pirates grow worried as he resists their lies.\nLuffy and Sanji make their way to the Fire Tank Pirates' hideout, where they are greeted by Vito, who is excited to see Sanji. Chopper, who looks like he has come out of the bath, comes out and reunites with his crewmates, and Luffy and Sanji are confused about his appearance. Chopper confirms that he has been bathing, which Luffy does not like as he wants to meet with Bege quickly. However, Vito reveals that Bege will not meet with them until they are clean, and the scuffed-up Luffy and Sanji realize that they will have to bathe.\nIn the women's bath, Nami and Carrot talk to Chiffon while they bathe. Nami tells her about her experiences with her sister Lola, and wonders about Big Mom telling her in rage about a time that Lola ran away from her arranged marriage. Chiffon reveals that no giants live on Totto Land because they have a bad relationship with Big Mom, but this nearly changed when Loki, the prince of Elbaf, fell in love with Lola at first sight and proposed to her. However, after Lola refused to marry him and ran away, Big Mom attempted to use Chiffon as a substitute, but the giants quickly realized the deception and their relations with Big Mom only grew worse. Ever since, Big Mom has given up on trying to mend relations with the giants and has focused instead on turning people into giants, which she had commissioned Caesar Clown to work on. Big Mom hated Lola for ruining her efforts toward reconciliation, and this hatred extended to Chiffon as well for looking exactly like Lola. This resulted in Chiffon being abused every time Big Mom saw her, and with her frequent wounds still on her mind, Chiffon has no problem with Bege's plan to assassinate her mother. She notes that Lola probably does not even know Big Mom wants to kill her because of her happy-go-lucky personality.\nElsewhere, after bathing, Luffy and Brook get some milk from the fridge to heal their injuries despite the Fire Tank Pirate guard's disapproval. To his shock, Luffy regains his lost tooth and Brook's head injuries heal thanks to the milk. With everyone clean, the Sanji Retrieval Team picks out new outfits, with Luffy initially donning the costume of the robot from Sora, Warrior of the Sea. Sanji leaves the room and runs into Nami, and as she passes by him, she tells him that she will make him work hard for her when he rejoins them, but this just makes him ecstatic. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Diesel have bathed as well, and they sit tied up in the hallway. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e gets angry at Chiffon for going against her family, but Chiffon states that Bege and Pez are her family now and Lola's life is in danger. The Sanji Retrieval Team makes their way to the meeting room, and Luffy looks around for Bege. Bege then arrives and prepares to see whether or not this potential alliance can work out.\nIn Sweet City, Big Mom's fourth son Charlotte Oven heads to the Whole Cake Chateau. The liquid on the ground sizzles when he steps in it, and when the gatekeepers prepare to open the entrance for him, he says there is no need as he steps into the door and melts it, allowing him to enter. The tea party is set to begin in three hours and 30 minutes.",

        "long_summary": "Bellamy laughs at Luffy's demand that he give back Mont Blanc Cricket's gold. After their last encounter in Mock Town, he doubts Luffy even knows how to throw a punch. Sarquiss still believes the bounty poster for Luffy with his new 100,000,000 bounty is a fake. He questions if the old one for 30,000,000 is also real as he watches Luffy's fight with Bellamy. Bellamy breaks off the roof they are on and springs at Luffy with Spring Snipe, but Luffy jumps out of the way. The Bellamy Pirates sit back to \"watch the show\". Bellamy manages to hit Luffy when he's falling from the rooftops, and smashes him into the boardwalks. Luffy gets up as if nothing has happened, but Bellamy is still unimpressed with his effort.\nWanting to finish it, Bellamy begins springing off all the nearby buildings around Luffy with his Spring Hopper technique, all the while mocking Luffy for being among the pirates who chased dreams. Angered, Luffy cracks his knuckles, recalling Bellamy asking if he even knew how to throw a punch. As Bellamy springs toward him to finish him off, Luffy punches downward, striking Bellamy down through the boardwalks so hard he leaves an imprint of his fist in the now-unconscious pirate's head. Sarquiss urges Bellamy to get up, thinking Bellamy was fooling around. But it turns out the drunkard that found Luffy's new wanted poster was right about Luffy's notoriety. With Bellamy's blood dripping from his fist, Luffy demands Cricket's gold back, and the town's people scatters in a panic after learning Luffy and Zoro's bounties are real.\nBack at Cricket's camp, all of his associates are back to work retrofitting the Going Merry thanks to Chopper's care. Nami berates Zoro for not going with Luffy to challenge Bellamy, even though he was beaten up earlier too. He does not take kindly to her insults, and Usopp tries to cool them down as they start beating on the ship in their argument. Back in Mock Town, Luffy sacks up Cricket's gold. With Bellamy still laying in the broken boardwalk, Sarquiss tries to challenge Luffy, but is held back by the others. When asked where he is going, Luffy raises his fist, still covered in Bellamy's blood causing Sarquiss to fall to the ground in fear. Luffy then points upward and tells them, \"The sky!\"\nDrifting in the ocean, Dracule Mihawk gets Luffy and Zoro's new posters. He is pleased to see that they can now shake the World Government with their defeat of Crocodile.\nMeanwhile, at Mary Geoise, the Five Elders\u2014the de facto rulers of the world\u2014find out from a Marine that \"Red Hair\" is trying to get in contact with \"Whitebeard\" via messenger. They determine that the two meeting is too dangerous, and they must find a successor for the defeated Crocodile among the Seven Warlords of the Sea quickly to maintain balance between \"the powers\". They also admit that they cannot keep Luffy unchecked. Indeed, a meeting of the remaining Warlords of the Sea has been ordered. Two arrive: Donquixote Doflamingo and Bartholomew Kuma, both of whom had massive bounties before becoming privateers. When he arrives, Doflamingo toys with two of the present Marines, using his powers to make them fight each other out of sheer boredom. He is told to stand down by the Fleet Admiral of the Marines, Sengoku, who is impressed that even two of the remaining six Warlords of the Sea showed up. Doflamingo said he only came because his \"island business\" was running so well he was bored of it. Shortly after, they are joined by Mihawk, making it three Warlords. He says he was merely an onlooker in these proceedings, as he's interested in the pirates responsible for Crocodile's defeat.\nShortly after, a foreign voice joins in, and the room is invaded by a tall, lanky man with tap shoes. One of the Marines present identifies him as Laffitte, a former peace officer from West Blue who was chased from his country for his cruel methods. He says he is here to recommend someone to replace Crocodile.\nSomewhere on the seas, a captain receives a letter from Shanks. His men insult the messenger, Rockstar, a relative newcomer to the Red Hair Pirates who has a 94,000,000 bounty. The intended recipient of the message, Whitebeard, rips up Shanks' letter. The captain appears to be ill, as he has nurses all around and is connected to several IVs and an oxygen line. He tells Rockstar that if Shanks wants to send a message, he should deliver it personally, and bring good booze along with it. Rockstar alerts Shanks by Den Den Mushi. Shanks apologizes for putting Rockstar through all that, and tells his men to get ready to set sail to meet Whitebeard.\nAt Mary Geoise, Laffitte recommends his captain, Marshall D. Teach, to replace Crocodile as a Warlord. Sengoku does not even know who this pirate is, but Lafitte tells him that his crew, the Blackbeard Pirates, are hatching a plan to make their names known.\nIn Mock Town, while the citizens were talking about Bellamy's defeat, Teach looks at Luffy's reward poster, and comments on it. Then Sarquiss runs into him and tells him to get out, so Teach buries his head into the ground. Then, he declares that he does not intend to capture weaklings, but one man out of 100,000,000, so he and his companions begin to leave the city, while discussing Laffitte and fate.\nLuffy, however, is already on his way to the other side of Jaya with Cricket's gold.",

        "long_summary": "Inside the Whole Cake Chateau, Sanji and Pudding rehearse their vows with a priest. The priest states that the marriage will be sealed with a kiss, and Sanji notes that this will be when Pudding attempts to shoot him. However, when Pudding talks to him, he is quickly taken aback by her beauty and struggles to remind himself of who she truly is.\nOutside the wedding venue, Bege checks on the Straw Hats' status, but finds Luffy leaning out of his body to look around. Luffy opens up the doors in Bege's body and jumps across them before being punched and taken back by Nami, and Bege remarks that he maybe should have killed them. Vito then calls out from atop the venue wall, remarking in excitement that Morgans is talking to Judge. He then reveals that Katakuri, Smoothie, Perospero, Compote, Daifuku, and Oven of the Charlotte Family are all in attendance, noting their strength and remarking that they will not be good enemies to have. The gate homie nearby is taken aback to hear that, and Bege tells Vito and Gotti to go check downstairs. Inside the Whole Cake Chateau, two of the Fire Tank Pirates are disguised as cooks and report to Bege that the cooks are enjoying a banquet after having made the wedding cake. With all passages and signals to the wedding venue closed off, the Fire Tank Pirates go off to complete their next task. However, they are stopped by a drunk cook, who notes that he does not recognize them. However, the cook is struck down by Gotti as he and Vito arrive.\nInside the wedding venue, some Chess Soldiers carry the portrait of Mother Carmel and place it on the table in front of Big Mom. She is joyful to see it, but no one else knows who Carmel is. When one person asks how she is related to Big Mom, Big Mom shouts at him to not intrude on her memories as she releases her Supreme King Haki and knocks him out. Her guests then present her with gifts that they acquired from exotic locations, and Morgans asks about the report of her acquiring a great undersea treasure. Big Mom confirms this, revealing the Tamatebako from Fish-Man Island, which she plans to open during the feast after Pudding's wedding. Outside, Bege's men return to him with their mission completed, and Bege tells Caesar to come out of his body with the mirror. Caesar does so, and Bege briefs him on his role, telling him that he will be flying the mirror into the venue once they assassinate Big Mom so they can escape. At this point, the gate homie realizes that the Fire Tank Pirates are plotting something, but her face is then immediately sliced off by Gotti. Bege then goes inside his body to check on the Straw Hats, only to find everyone except Jinbe sleeping. Jinbe says that they have gone a while without sleep, and promises to wake them up ten minutes before the wedding starts. With everything ready, Bege has his subordinates enter his body and goes into the venue, saying that there is no turning back now.\nBack in Sanji and Pudding's room, Sanji attempts to make conversation with Pudding, trying to act nervous about the upcoming affair. Pudding answers sweetly, making him lovestruck and causing him to struggle to remember her true nature. He asks if Pudding does not want to be kissed on the mouth, and Pudding says that she does, which causes him to get a nosebleed that makes him rocket around the room and stains his suit in blood. Pudding acts concerned, but is really extremely appalled and angered by Sanji's display of foolishness. Sanji is treated, and he and Pudding prepare to be brought out to the wedding venue, with Pudding gleefully anticipating her planned assassination. In the wedding venue, the Charlotte Family talks with the Vinsmoke Family about the imminent union between their two families, and Big Mom and Judge make a toast. Bege talks with Perospero, and they talk about preparing for the upcoming event. Inside Bege's body, everyone except Luffy is awake and ready to go as Sanji and Pudding arrive on a teacup carried by Zeus. Glitter and confetti floats through the air as the wedding guests celebrate, and Sanji acts very lovestruck, which causes Bege to think he is just acting well. With the bride and groom nearing the altar, the clock strikes 12 and the wedding has officially begun.",

Kujaku uses her Devil Fruit abilities to trap the bounty hunters in a circle of buildings before Prince Grus informs Tashigi they are ready for Garp's attack.\nGarp launches his ship into the air with his fist, then rides the ship onto the island.

However, behind all the celebrations and cheers, there are new troubles on the horizon. Blackbeard is on the move with his new crew members from Impel Down's Level 6. Also, upon Whitebeard's death, the world's balance has crumbled, and with his last words confirming the existence of One Piece, pirates all over the world are simmering at the brim.",
        "long_summary": "Sengoku has declared the war officially over. While the Marines and the people of the world are celebrating the Marines' victory in the war, they lose sense of what really was going on. They soon find out that with Whitebeard dead, more ruthless pirates will be coming ashore and torture the people. More pirates now know that the One Piece is real and so, more pirates will begin to form in search for One Piece. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Brannew tells Sengoku about Impel Down's state. Magellan is severely injured and blaming himself for the defeat. Many prisoners escaped while some were taken in by Blackbeard. Sengoku is shocked at this news and tells Brannew to get their files, wanted posters and all their information but he denies and says that the World Government intends to keep it secret. In response, Sengoku becomes angry and screams, \"Damn them!\"\nElsewhere, in the backstreets of Marineford, Gecko Moria is being attacked by Pacifistas commanded by Donquixote Doflamingo, who states that Moria is too weak to continue being a Warlord of the Sea, and that it would be better if the people believed he died in the war. When Moria angrily demands if this was Sengoku's order, Donquixote told him to try higher. Meanwhile, the other Supernovas (except Luffy and Zoro) were witnessing the whole Marineford fight from their ships far away. Scratchmen Apoo questions why Trafalgar Law, known for his brutality, would save Monkey D. Luffy and states there must be some catch. Hawkins thinks it is odd that the odds of Luffy being alive never reaches zero. Eustass Kid tells his crew that nothing is over however, it is the beginning of the New Era, one which no one has ever laid eyes on.\nMeanwhile in the Heart Pirates' submarine, Bepo feels really hot because of his fur and wants to surface. After they surface, Bepo looks to see if all sides are safe but finds out a Marine ship was beside them. He also sees Salome and is shocked about it. Boa Hancock lands in the submarine from the Marine ship and tells them that she turned all the Marines in the ship to stone. Law comes out and tells her about Luffy's condition. Emporio Ivankov along with his escapees from Impel Down shows up on the Marines ship and talks about how brave Luffy was and what made him lose consciousness. He also asked why Law saved Luffy, but before he could say anything Ivankov stopped him and said that sometimes instincts tells you what to do. Jinbe comes out from the submarine, still heavily wounded and tells them how shameful he feels because he failed to protect anyone precious to him while Law tells him to rest or else the wound might open up. The episode ends after Luffy is seen, still in a coma.",

He recalls how both of them had always been together, how they always ate together, slept together, and even tested their skills together.\nThere is then a flashback of when Luffy and Ace met each other at Arabasta. It shows Ace expressing how he was part of the Whitebeard Pirates, and how the mark on his back was his pride. Ace tells Luffy that Whitebeard was the strongest pirate that he has ever met, and wants to make him Pirate King, not Luffy. With Luffy bluntly stating that he will just have to fight Whitebeard. The scene switches to when Ace was on Luffy's ship, with Luffy asking him if he wanted to join his crew and Ace's explaining how he was hunting down Blackbeard. The scene switches again, to when Ace and Luffy part ways in Arabasta, and where Ace gives Luffy his Vivre card. Another memory appears of when Luffy met Blackbeard for the first time in Mock Town, arguing on whether the pie tasted good or not. Which continues to the fighting with Bellamy, the customers laughing at their belief of Sky Island, and Blackbeard claiming that a pirate's dream is everlasting. Luffy is then in the Kuja palace, showing his disbelief of the war that was to commence and how Ace is sentenced to execution. Continuing on with the flashbacks, Luffy is in Impel Down and meets Blackbeard, attempting to strike him but to be stopped by Jinbe. It is there that Blackbeard explains how capturing Ace would allow him to become a Shichibukai and how Luffy should be thanking his brother for interfering, or else he would have captured Luffy instead.\nBack to the present, Jinbe talks about how Ace's hunt for Blackbeard began. On the other hand, the Marines assembling at the bay, where Ace is locked up. Ace recalls the fight he had with Blackbeard and his defeat. The episode ends with Ace locked up and gritting his teeth, three hours prior to his execution.",

        "long_summary": "On a certain island, the Guardians prowl around near its shore, and they look at the ruined buildings close to them. Blackback is impatient as he waits for Nekomamushi to return with Marco, but Roddy reminds him that they cannot go where their ruler is to avoid scaring the residents. Behind a nearby waterfall is a small blissful village where Marco works as a doctor, and he uses his phoenix flames to heal a pet sphinx named Tama.\nMarco was once the First Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, whose captain, Whitebeard, treated his crew like his own sons. During the Summit War of Marineford two years ago, Whitebeard was betrayed by his subordinate Squard, whose entire crew had been killed by Gol D. Roger. However, Whitebeard instantly recognized that Squard did this as a result of resenting his crewmate Ace, whom they were trying to rescue, being Roger's son, which had been craftily stoked by Akainu beforehand. As a result, he immediately forgave Squard. After successfully rescuing Ace, Whitebeard elected to remain behind and allow his crew to escape, and he asked Ace if he had been a good father, which Ace tearfully affirmed. However, Whitebeard ultimately met his end at the hands of Blackbeard, a former crewmate whom he refused to consider family after Blackbeard had killed his crewmate Thatch. Several decades earlier, a young Whitebeard was asked by his crewmates what his biggest desire was after he showed no interest in their treasure, and Whitebeard had responded that it was a family.\nAfter Whitebeard's death, Blackbeard stole his Devil Fruit, wielding it alongside his own Yami Yami no Mi power to gain unfathomable strength. Blackbeard would go on to conquer nearly all of Whitebeard's possessions en route to taking his spot among the Four Emperors, and Marco led the remainder of the Whitebeard Pirates in an attempt to stop him in the Payback War. However, Blackbeard proved too powerful for them, and now all Marco can do is keep watch over this island, which is where Whitebeard grew up. It suffered from immense poverty that prevented it from becoming a member of the World Government, and so frequently came under attack by pirates and marauders. Whitebeard left the island at an early age, but for the remainder of his life, he sent the treasure that he won to the people there, allowing them to prosper, as this island was his greatest treasure. Marco tells Nekomamushi that the Shichibukai Edward Weevil was going around claiming to be Whitebeard's son and looking for Whitebeard's treasure. Marco has no idea whether or not Weevil is actually Whitebeard's son, though he does know that his mother, Buckin, did sail with Whitebeard around 40 years ago. Regardless, there is no treasure, and so Marco anticipates that Weevil and Buckin will eventually come after him and this island someday. Thus, he will be unable to leave the island with Nekomamushi, and tells him to give Luffy a message. He asks what they will be doing in Wano Country, and is shocked when Nekomamushi reveals that they are aiming to take down Kaidou.",

        "long_summary": "Two years have passed since the Summit War of Marineford. Sakazuki is now the new Fleet Admiral of the Marines. Due to the catastrophic destruction of Marineford, the Marines decided to build a new headquarters named New Marineford. New Marineford is an even greater fortress built to acclimate to the raging pirate era. It has become the new home of justice located at the entrance to the New World.\nSakazuki is angered when he learns that Fujitora has gone to Mary Geoise. He had only allowed the Admiral to set foot on a Marine base if he had captured Luffy and Law. Fujitora rationalizes his visit by saying that Mary Geoise isn't technically a Marine base. Sakazuki then finds out that Ryokugyu is also at Mary Geoise, so he orders T-Bone to have Ryokugyu turn Fujitora away when he sees him.\nHe and Borsalino talk about how Luffy's bounty has gone significantly higher. This makes Sakazuki regret not ending Luffy's life when he had the chance back in Marineford. He curses the Great Pirate Era and vows to end it. He recalls Whitebeard saying that, like there are people who have inherited Roger's will, there will also be others who will inherit Ace's. He adds that no matter how they might destroy their spirit, no one will be able to extinguish their flame.\nMeanwhile, Sengoku also muses about how quickly the Great Pirate Era gathered so much momentum in just two years. He commends Luffy for making history by being the first intruder to infiltrate Impel Down. Even if he snuck in alone, Luffy was able to escape with an army of inmates who had become allies, including former enemies. He also notes Luffy's ability to make miracles happen, such as when the Gates of Justice opened for Luffy's ship as he and some inmates tried to escape. He then recalls the events in Marineford, such as Whitebeard's arrival, the intense battle between the Marines and Whitebeard's fleet, and Luffy falling from the sky to rescue Ace.",

Marguerite then realizes that she cannot afford to be friendly with Luffy, and attacks him, forcing him to flee. A few kilometers from the island, Boa Hancock - the Snake Princess and one of the Shichibukai - meets with a Marine vessel commanded by Vice-Admiral Momonga, who informs her of Portgas D. Ace's upcoming execution and the likelihood of Whitebeard intervening. He orders her to join the fight against Whitebeard's forces or risk losing her status as a Shichibukai and having the treaty between Kuja and the World Government nullified. Hancock refuses and, using her Mero Mero no Mi powers, turns his men to stone and leaves.",
        "long_summary": "On Amazon Lily, Luffy sets himself back into shape and reminds Marguerite he needs to meet up with his crew. She thinks of how men look and when Luffy asks for help taking the womanly vest off, Marguerite is confused, but nonetheless removes it. As Luffy prepares to leave, he hopes his crew are still alive and that's all that matters. He also thinks of the horror that Kuma put him through and prepares to get stronger. He almost hand-walks off the island, but then asks for a ship. Marguerite reminds him the island is on a Calm Belt. As such, sailors will not make it to the island. Her leader's flagship, the Yuda is charioted by two large snakes. Luffy insists on making a raft to make it to Sabaody Archipelago, but it breaks beneath his weight. This prompts Marguerite to get him out of the water. She begins to think that men will sink like rocks. Angered, Marguerite worries she'll become attached to Luffy and fires some arrows, which the Straw Hat captain dodges. He realizes the arrows can be powerful enough to pierce rock. Marguerite points out the arrows are imbued with Haki. Just then, Kikyo and the others give chase. Sweet Pea informs Marguerite that the leader will be coming soon. Meanwhile, a group of Kuja pirates argue with some marines over a dead sea king. The agreement between the Kuja and the World Government forbids the Marines from going within 3 kilometers of the island. Momonga tells of how he encountered the Sea King and how he was impatient with meeting the woman pirate. The marines bullets were anemic against the Sea King, but then Momonga breached the monster's mouth and killed it from the inside out with an x-shaped opening.\nMomonga then grows more impatient and demands Boa Hancock's presence. Some of the pirates tell him to leave. Momonga then points out that Hancock is to attend the public execution of Portgas D. Ace and will not take no for an answer. If rejected, Hancock will be stripped of her title as Shichibukai, leaving the Kuja as ordinary pirates. Suddenly, footsteps are heard within the Yuda. Boa Hancock comes out to the deck complaining about a kitten blocking her way. One of the Kuja takes responsibility for her crime. Momonga then advises the guard be kept up as Hancock can be very frightening and beautiful. Meanwhile, Luffy continues fleeing from the Kuja warriors wishing Nami were with him. Desperate, Luffy climbs a tree and hops through the jungle. Kikyo then becomes determined to kill Luffy before Hancock arrives. The young Straw Hat captain almost climbs a rock wall, but is knocked into the jungle by an arrow. Hancock and her sisters stand before Momonga,, but refuse to go to war with Momonga, wanting to retain her status. She also demands the cargo from Momonga's ship. The vice-admiral tries to defy her, but the marines begin to comply. With the execution one week away at Marineford, Whitebeard will try to rescue Ace. The entire Marine Headquarters would need every moment to prepare.\nThe Kuja leader still refuses to give in and one of the marines had an accident, being turned into stone. The marines learned that one of their ships had an entire crew turned to stone with loving looks on their faces. Sandersonia and Marigold point out how their sister gets her way. No matter what anyone does, Hancock says she is beautiful. The Kuja and Marines cheer, then Hancock fires a Love Love Mellow, shooting energetic hearts at the aroused Marines, turning them into statues. Momonga is horrified and angered with a knife in his hand. He also says one is not zero. The Kuja enjoy their loot and Hancock sets course for Amazon Lily. Determined, Momonga then orders that if she does not come back in two days, she will be stripped of her title. Hancock then dares him to do what he likes.",

        "long_summary": "While the rest of the world is finding out about the Straw Hats' new bounties and events at Enies Lobby, Blackbeard is seen reading an earlier account of the Straw Hat\u2019s activities at Enies Lobby, commenting that their bounties should rise afterwards. Lafitte wonders if the Straw Hats hijacked a Sea Train from Water 7 to get to Enies Lobby. Van Auger comments that Water 7 isn\u2019t too far from the Blackbeard Pirate\u2019s current location and thinks they\u2019ll cross paths again while Doc Q suggests that fate may allow them to meet again and take action when it happens. Jesus Burgess laughs while carrying a sack and asks what they\u2019re waiting for, and Blackbeard responds in agreement and announces his intent to stop the Straw Hats before the Marines can.\nMeanwhile, the townspeople are seen defeated and scattered around. As Blackbeard's crew walks ahead, they pass by an observing Ace, who is seen squatting in a roof near them. Ace calls out Blackbeard by referencing him as Teach, stating that they need to talk. The narration then plays, confirming that history-changing events are taking place in this small island called Banaro Island, three days before the Straw Hat\u2019s fate and bounties were revealed to the world.\nBlackbeard looks up in surprise and addresses him as Commander Ace, to which Ace responds by stating that he has no right to call him that anymore. Lafitte comments that this must be the famous pirate \u201cFire Fist\u201d Ace that they\u2019re witnessing. Ace confirms Lafitte\u2019s address and then notes that Blackbeard is a captain of his own crew now. Blackbeard responds that it\u2019s been a while since they interacted, and teases Ace if he\u2019s been looking for him. Ace responds to Blackbeard to cut his act and that there is only one reason for him to be here. In response, Blackbeard asks him to join his crew instead of fighting, claiming that he has the perfect plan to become the Pirate King while mentioning that Whitebeard\u2019s days are numbered. Blackbeard further mentions that he plans to head to Water 7 to kill Luffy and present it as a gift to the World Government.\nA surprised Ace then reveals to Blackbeard that he won\u2019t let him kill his younger brother. Upon refusing to join Blackbeard\u2019s crew, Auger shoots Ace with a bullet harmlessly piercing through his Mera Mera no Mi\u2019s Logia Devil Fruit abilities. Ace smirks and comments that Blackbeard\u2019s crew weren\u2019t taught manners, to which Ace retaliates at Auger with Fire Gun. From behind, Burgess launches a hotel towards Ace to which he burns up with Flame Commandment Fire Pillar. The rubble lands near Blackbeard who yells at Auger and Burgess, warning them that they\u2019re not strong enough to fight Ace by themselves. As Burgess apologizes, Ace launches Fire Fist at Blackbeard\u2019s crew, managing to hit their captain. Engulfed in flames, Blackbeard rolls around in pain while his unscathed crew runs to his aid. As Auger fans the flames out, Ace walks towards them. Blackbeard dismisses his crew\u2019s help and tells them to stand back. As Blackbeard recovers, he understands Ace\u2019s intent to finish him, before admitting to the crime of murdering their former crew mate, fourth division commander Thatch.\nBlackbeard reveals that he had no choice but to kill Thatch in order to obtain the Yami Yami no Mi, a Devil Fruit he\u2019s been chasing after for decades and so the rule goes in Whitebeard\u2019s ship: whoever finds a devil fruit can claim it as theirs to eat. Blackbeard emphasizes that he memorized the shapes and colors of many Devil Fruits until he recognized the Yami Yami no Mi sitting in Thatch\u2019s hand. He further states that by lying low in Whitebeard\u2019s crew, he would have the best shot at finding it someday. Blackbeard tells Ace to witness the power he gained, stating its power is unique among Logia types. With his right hand, Blackbeard forms a black pillar into the sky and tells Ace that just as he is made out of fire, his own body is made out of darkness. The townspeople catch sight of Blackbeard\u2019s dark pillar, describing it as the weird black smoke from before. Seeing no other options, the townspeople run away in fear.\nBlackbeard continues his fruit\u2019s display, stating that it is said to be the most powerful of them all. He tells Ace to witness his power, and Ace urges him on. Meanwhile, Blackbeard\u2019s crew is seen running away, with Burgess stating that their captain may kill them if they don\u2019t get away in time. Doc Q falls over and is dragged away by Burgess and Auger. Stronger subsequently collapses behind them, and Burgess proceeds to yell at him for also falling down.\nThe pillar descends into Blackbeard\u2019s position and then spreads out, engulfing the ground of the town. The remaining townspeople observe the darkness spreading further out, wondering if it\u2019ll suck them up as well. More of them run away, as Blackbeard continues his speech about his power: darkness is like gravity, and it swallows everything around it. Ace acknowledges his claims, but mentions its not surrounding him. Blackbeard tells him this is intentional, as he wants him to see the power of the Yami Yami no Mi. Blackbeard uses Black Hole, which destroys and sucks up the entire town. The townspeople watch in fear as Blackbeard continues his speech, stating his power crushes and compresses everything his darkness touches. Moments later, the townspeople see the vast emptiness that is left of their town. With his left hand swallowing the remnants of the dark hole, he uses Liberation, and a black pillar forms out of his back and throws out everything the dark hole had just swallowed up and destroyed.\nBlackbeard marvels at his power, stating that this was worth killing Thatch over before pausing to see green balls of light appear towards him, which is Ace\u2019s Firefly Fiery Doll. Blackbeard is engulfed in flames and withers in pain, to which Ace comments that he understands his darkness power, but not at his sensitivity to pain. Ace states that as a Logia type, the flames should not hurt, let alone hit Blackbeard. Blackbeard\u2019s power absorbs the flames and responds that his power absorbs everything around him including pain, stating that he is unable to simply turn into an element and dodge an attack. He claims the pain he then receives is much greater than what a normal human feels. Even so, he states the tradeoff is worth utilizing the power, stating that there is one more thing his power can swallow. With his left hand, he summons Black Vortex, which utilizes gravity to pull a Devil Fruit user into his grasp. Ace\u2019s hat flies away as he is being pulled in, and comments that the power is indeed strong. Blackbeard appears before him, being able to grab Ace\u2019s shoulder and both of them realize what had just happened. Blackbeard punches Ace and sends him flying towards the rubble, commenting that it must have been a while since the last time he was hurt like that. Blackbeard finally states that his power can even absorb Devil Fruit powers, so long as he is in contact with the user.\nWiping blood off his mouth, Ace states then all he has to do is avoid contact. Blackbeard reminds him that gravity is stronger than he thinks, and he summons Black Vortex. As Ace is pulled in, he uses St. Elmo\u2019s Fire, sending two pillars of fire through Blackbeard. Blackbeard manages to grab Ace anyways and punches him away, before dealing with his new damage again. His power absorbs the fire pillars away, and Ace realizes that Blackbeard\u2019s power will be more difficult to manage than he expected. Ace fires Cross Fire at Blackbeard and the impact falls a giant rock named Banana Rock which the townspeople observe. The townspeople fear that the ongoing combat may destroy their island in its entirety. Meanwhile, Auger and the rest of the crew are watching from afar, as he comments that unlike other users in combat, Ace isn\u2019t handicapped to only utilizing his Logia abilities.\nAfter some moments, both Blackbeard and Ace are seen in exhaustion, with Ace on his knees while Blackbeard stands tall. Blackbeard once more asks Ace to join his crew, stating that it would be a waste to finish him here. Ace struggles but stands up, stating that if he joined, he can never call himself a man again. Ace says no matter what happens, he won\u2019t submit and live a life of regrets. Blackbeard dismisses his morals, stating that they\u2019re meaningless if he is dead. Blackbeard understands that Ace won\u2019t change his mind, and summons a black pillar towards him. In response, Ace summons a giant fireball at the tip of his finger, the Great Flame Commandment Flame Emperor. Blackbeard remarks that this is the sun facing against darkness and that only one can win. Ace responds that he will make Whitebeard the King, or he will die trying. The two charge at each other with their massive attacks and from afar, the island is seen with their attacks colliding in the center, before the scene shines away into a view of Ace\u2019s hat lying on the ground. The narrator concludes that this clash would set off a chain of events that would change the world.",

Zoro takes the opportunity to jump into the air with Usopp's trampolina and decapitates the dragon.\nMeanwhile, Nami, Chopper, Franky, Brook, and Sanji had fallen asleep due to sleeping gas and abducted by men in hazmat suits except for Brook who they thought had already died.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy, Zoro, Robin, and Usopp are now facing the dragon who asks who they are. Luffy exclaims that the dragon just talked, but Usopp says that he is hearing things, while running away. As they remain intrigued about the dragon, it lets loose a burst of fire, which they all narrowly evade. Usopp trembles in fear while Luffy and Zoro get excited about facing the dragon. Luffy uses Jet Pistol, which does not seem to effect the dragon much, and he realizes that its hide is really hard. The dragon slams Luffy down with its tail forcefully. Zoro charges towards the dragon, but gets distracted when the dragon talks again and it stretches its head out to bite, which Zoro narrowly evades. Zoro uses a technique called 'Ultra-Hunt' which shakes the dragon up a bit, but it recovers quickly and tries to bite Zoro again, which he manages to block but proclaims that the dragon is very resilient and strong. An enraged Luffy then breaks out from the rubble and kicks the dragon, taking it by surprise and hurting it. Zoro tells Luffy that he heard it speak, while Robin and Usopp also witnessed it speaking.\nThe dragon flies and uses another fire breath attack, while asking if they are allies of \"that\" Shichibukai. The Straw Hats take cover under some rocks and walls, Usopp gets scared even more while Robin questions if it has a grudge against the Shichibukai. Luffy and Zoro are making a \"plan\", with Luffy jumping up to knock the dragon down. When he grabs hold of a wall to launch himself, Luffy realizes it is hot and while he is air-borne, the dragon tries to knock him off with another burst of fire. Luffy stumbles and rolls around on the dragon's body, while exclaiming that it is hot, and finds a pair of legs sticking out of the dragon. The dragon then tries to bite Luffy, but accidentally bites its wing which is thrusted forward by Luffy, making it yelp in pain and fall. Zoro then starts to charge forward and yells at Usopp, who uses Trampolia to enable Zoro to jump up and he uses a technique called Iai: Shi Shishi Sonson, and cuts the dragon's head off. While they fall, Luffy starts laughing and says that the dragon looks yummy. Zoro then says that they could have a barbecue with the flames on the island as Robin uses her powers to catch the two.\nBack at the Thousand Sunny, Sanji finishes making a meal for Nami and calls for her, but finds everybody is asleep with some fog floating around. Sanji, realizing that it is not fog but actually gas, tries to contact Luffy by reaching for the Den Den Mushi, but is put to sleep himself for breathing in too much of the gas beforehand. A group of peculiar individuals emerge in hazmat suits with the letters PH on them and capture the crew, except for Brook. They mention a master that they are taking their captives to.",

Hancock begs Luffy not to cause trouble. Luffy promises he will not and calls Hancock her real name and not \"Hammock\", causing Hancock to fall to the ground swooning. As Hancock goes to the lower floors, she sees Luffy and prays for his good fortune. Luffy tries to say thanks via lips, Hancock however mistakes it as \"I love you\" and collapses. On Level 1, Luffy runs into Buggy, who is trying to escape from the prison. With Luffy's cover blown thanks to Buggy, they decide to team up together to defeat the enemies.",
        "long_summary": "Upon entry to Impel Down, the Surveillance Den Den Mushi glares for anything suspicious. Boa Hancock believes Domino will make her powerless. Just as Domino is about to apply the Seastone handcuffs, Hancock flirts with the guard and fires a Love-Love Mellow beam at her, turning Domino and the Den Den Mushi into statues. With the guards in shock, Monkey D. Luffy comes out safely. Hancock insists that it is where they part ways. If she had removed her cloak, there would be no place for Luffy to hide.\nShe also worries about the horrors that Impel Down has in store if her new friend were captured. But Luffy is confident and promises to not let her down, saying \"Hancock\" instead of \"Hammock\" for the first time. Hancock dreams of marriage with Luffy thinking she will die happy. Outside, Hannyabal and Momonga are impatient.\nSuddenly, Hannyabal gets a call and moves to check on Hancock. Just then, Hancock and Domino walk out having completed the body search. He accepts that the check was short. Luffy sneaks away waiting for Hannyabal to leave. The Vice-Warden warns the group must go through the Burning Heat Floor by the warden. As the elevator doors close, Hancock wishes Luffy luck and suddenly thinks Luffy loves her.\nLuffy learns that Portgas D. Ace is being held in the basement level and the Vivre Card is almost burning out.\nOutside, a Sea King is cut through by Blugoris to be stored in the fridge for dinner.\nAs Hannyabal's party continue their descent, they pass the suffering of minor offense prisoners. Hannyabal explains that Level 1 is the Crimson Floor, a secret even to him; Level 2 is the Floor of Wild Beasts from Hell; Level 3 is the Starvation Floor, and Level 4 is the Burning Heat Floor, where prisoners are boiled. He also hopes the group will enjoy the torture of prisoners.\nWhile Luffy races down the stairs, a group of prisoners are surprised that Buggy has begun breaking out. He plans to leave the prisoners behind thinking it is every man for himself. Buggy runs through the halls and is nearly spotted by a Surveillance Den Den Mushi. But as he continues his run, it spots him and he bids a greeting. Angry, Buggy decides to try and fight his way out. The Blugori guards chase down Buggy.\nMeanwhile, Luffy supposedly comes to a dead end and dodges some guards. Luffy swings through the doorway. On the Crimson Floor, the Straw Hat captain hears Buggy crying in distress. The clown pirate tries to escape and stops near a danger button. He unexpectedly presses it, causing spikes to nearly drop onto Luffy and spears to come out of the wall.\nJust then, guards are attracted to the shenanigans Luffy was causing. Luffy is then spotted by the prisoners that Buggy left behind. He explains he was coming in and was not behind bars. The mention of Ace intrigues the prisoners. They point Ace is locked on Level 5, a block where prisoners with high bounties are held. As the prisoners request Luffy to free them, the Blugoris run towards Buggy as well as Luffy. Buggy continues running even when split in two.\nThe clown pirate is shocked to see Luffy again even after their past encounter. The Straw Hat pirate informs Buggy he just broke into the jail. As the two argue, a Blugori almost hits them. Angry that the escape plan is botched, Buggy looks back in his despising of Luffy and Shanks, then he and Luffy decide to fight through, knocking out some Blugori guards.",

        "long_summary": "Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper are fishing off the side of the boat while the rest of the crew relaxes. Chopper catches a large fish, and Usopp catches a small one. Sanji offers Nami some tropical juice that he says will make her skin smooth, and Luffy and the others ask for some, too, as they want to look cuter. Luffy keeps fishing and pulls out a large sea snail, and the crew discuss whether or not to cook it. Before they can, a hatch on the side of the snail's shell opens and a man comes out. He introduces himself as Rice Rice, a traveling salesman from the Den-Den Company who was lost in a storm during a delivery. He thanks them by offering them free product catalogs. While he was explaining his trade to most of the crew, Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper wander into his Escar and begin playing with his inventory. He interrupts them and takes the Buru Buru Blade from Luffy, explaining its different features and apparent value. When he sees Chopper playing with the Ab-Ab Slider he does the same, claiming that both were his company\u2019s \u201cNumber 1\u201d product. He then straps Usopp into the Golden Fish, much to Usopp\u2019s dismay, to demonstrate its functions and then offers the three products, Mero Mero Juice, a stack of encyclopedias, and binoculars for 23,800.\nAs the crew thumbed through the catalogs, Sanji noticed the company\u2019s knife collection. Rice Rice pitched him a super flexible knife from High Mountain and then offered him a dozen table knife set, scissors, a peeling knife, and an electric sharpener for 2,980. He tried to pitch his Silky Smooth Skin Soap to Robin,and she commented on his company\u2019s vast inventory. Luffy asked him if they sold live animals and when Rice Rice told him they did not, the captain was disappointed.\nNami asked if he sold paper strong enough to resist weathering. Rice Rice revealed his Millennium Paper, explaining its qualities and possible uses. When Luffy asked if it could be used to make paper airplanes, Rice Rice annoyedly said that doing so would be a waste. Recognizing Nami\u2019s strong desire for the paper, he tried to cheat her and drive up the paper\u2019s price. He offers it to her for a \u201creduced rate\u201d of 48 million and she asks if he could take it down further. When he offers to sell it for 47.5 million she countered offered with 2 million. Though Rice Rice drops back to a 4.8 million offer, Sanji said they would pay for it. He ties up Luffy and proposes they turn him into the Marines and Rice Rice realizes that he was the notorious pirate Monkey D. Luffy. As he trembles in fear he notices the crew\u2019s jolly roger and falls to the ship\u2019s deck, nervously cowering. He quickly jumps to his feet and makes an excuse that he had an appointment to get to, climbs into his Escar and flees the ship in haste.\nWith Rice Rice gone the crew notices that he has left the inventory he was showing them, including the Millennium Paper Nami wanted. She takes it into her room telling her crewmates to keep quiet and watch the clouds for any weather changes. She decides to start making her dream of drawing a map of the world a reality, settling down to draw Little Garden, Drum Island, and Arabasta. She recalls standing on a cliff in Cocoyasi Village with Bell-m\u00e8re and Nojiko, asking her mom where the wind and sea come from. Bell-m\u00e8re answers, laughing and patting her daughter's head. Nami then recalls when she returned to that spot after stealing books from a shop in her village and her mom came up to bring her home for dinner. Nami asks her mom about what is past the sea, to which Bell-m\u00e8re responds saying that she did not know past the Grand Line. She then told her mom her resolve to travel the world and make a map of everywhere she goes.\nBack outside, Sanji orders Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper to clean the ship's deck. Zoro argues that Robin should help instead of relaxing with her book but Sanji defends her. Zoro and Sanji begin to fight over this causing the ship's deck to shake. With the rumble, Nami's ink pen slides across the paper while she is mid-stroke. Aggravated, she comes out of her room and hits both of them over the head telling everyone to be quiet. She returns to her drawing and starts a new draft.\nBack outside, Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper try cleaning the ship by riding on the Ab-Ab Slider with a mop. They use the Silky Smooth Skin Soap and make sudsy bubbles which cover the entire deck. Nami comes out when she hears them laughing loudly and is surprised by the bubbles. Getting carried away, Luffy falls off the Ab-Ab Slider and overboard. He grabs the figurehead to prevent himself from falling into the sea but he launches himself straight into Nami's room knocking all of her map-making supplies to the floor in a crash. Furious, she demands they all stay quiet or else she would charge them all 100,000. Luffy tries to apologize, but she pushes them all out. Chopper is both scared and saddened by Nami's frustration.\nNami returns to her map-making and everyone except Chopper falls asleep on the ship's deck. He notices the clouds change and a tornado appears before them. Terrified, he tries to tell Nami but recalls her threat. Unsure what to do he sits on the ship's deck in fear. Nami finishes her first map and exits her room to find Chopper crying about the tornado and not being able to tell her. She reassures him that everything will be alright and wakes up the crew. They all jump to raise the sails and steer the ship, except Robin, who continues to read in the rain. After they pass the storm Nami tells everyone about her first map and reaffirms her dream to chart the whole sea. Robin finishes reading and closes her book and the crew lowers the sails to continue onward.",

Momonga states regardless he is still going to Impel Down for being a pirate.\nMeanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates have Nami create a plan for the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates to rescue Lily's father. Chopper, Robin, Brook, and Luffy are the diversion group while Usopp, Sanji, Zoro, and Lily are in the submarine. Luffy goes on the submarine because he finds the diversion group boring. As they go to rescue him, Usopp mentions to Lily that they have met giants before such as Dorry and Brogy, surprising Lily that they met them and states that her father have been friends with the two since they were kids. They execute the plan as Robin uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to take out the Marines around the ships while Brook uses his Yomi Yomi no Mi abilities to scare them away. Sanji uses Sky Walk to fight the Marines from another ship while Zoro cuts the chains around Panz Fry. They rescue Panz Fry, but Momonga attacks Luffy, forcing Zoro to intercept him on the spot.\nAs Lily is reunited with her father, the reunion is ruined as a person named Shuzo intercepts them and attacks Panz Fry. Momonga is shocked to see him, as the two reveal a history together. Shuzo states that the Marines sending a pirate to Impel Down is pathetic and that all pirates from the New World need to be killed and he, along with the Neo Marines and their leader, Z will execute all pirates in the world. Momonga is shocked by the name, having known Z for a while, as the latter is a former Marine Admiral.\nShuzo now decides to kill Panz Fry himself and goes to attack him, but Sanji intercepts and Shuzo is tackled to the ground by the pirate. Luffy attempts to attack and is thrown into the water prompting Zoro to abandon his fight with Momonga and save Luffy. Luffy eventually is saved and prepares to fight Shuzo himself while Zoro will fight Momonga.",

At the scrapyard, Bonney attempts to kill Vegapunk. Meanwhile, a masked assassin approaches Egghead.",
        "long_summary": "Shaka continues explaining his visit to Ohara. When Vegapunk visited the island to pay respects, he discovered giants fishing the books out of the lake. Though Vegapunk was initially concerned with the giants\u2019 intentions, Monkey D. Dragon appeared and explained that the giants intended to transport the books to Elbaf to withhold them from the World Government. Vegapunk then travelled to Elbaf to read the books, gaining knowledge from the scholars that the World Government attempted to suppress. The Ohara Incident also led Dragon, a friend of Clover, to later form the Revolutionary Army, joining forces with Emporio Ivankov and Bartholomew Kuma. Finishing his story, Shaka confirms to Robin that the leader of the giants was Saul, the same person who saved Robin from the Buster Call. Shaka then leads the Straw Hats to the security room.\nMeanwhile, Luffy\u2019s group questions Vegapunk, who is known for his balloon-like head but currently wears only an apple-shaped cap in its place. Vegapunk explains he ate the Nomi Nomi no Mi, making him a \u201cBrain Human\u201d and allowing him to absorb nigh-infinite amounts of knowledge. However, as he learned more, his brain grew as a result, becoming inefficiently large. So, he detached his brain and replaced it with an antenna. The still-expanding brain, dubbed the \u201cPunk Records,\u201d is the giant egg floating above the island, and remotely connects to Vegapunk\u2019s body via the antenna. Furthermore, Vegapunk split his personality into six different satellites (Shaka, Lilith, Edison, Pythagoras, Atlas and York), which use the same brain but serve different purposes.\nBonney suddenly attacks Vegapunk, wielding a beam saber and demanding justice for her father. However, the beam\u2019s light attracts a swarm of insects, which causes Bonney to faint in shock as Shaka\u2019s group watches via surveillance footage. Vegapunk deems the saber a failed invention for its tendency to attract such insects.\nVegapunk explains that Momonosuke\u2019s Devil Fruit was also a failed experiment. He created an artificial Devil Fruit intended to replicate Kaidou\u2019s Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu, which was later accidentally eaten by Momonosuke. Despite granting all the abilities the original fruit provided, the fruit was deemed a failure based on colour alone, as the eater became a pink dragon instead of an azure one.\nLuffy questions Vegapunk about the robot, but Vegapunk explains that the legendary Iron Giant is not one of his inventions. Instead, it was created two hundred years prior and attacked Mary Geoise.\nIn the distance, a masked assassin accompanied by a pigeon approaches Egghead, tasked with eliminating Vegapunk.",

An unharmed pirate ship proceeds past them. Meanwhile, the Five Elders are informed that the Whitebeard Pirates and the Red Hair Pirates have broke through the Marine's defenses and that the two crews are arranged to have a meeting.\nOn Whitebeard's ship, Whitebeard is informed of Shanks arrival. At Navy Headquarters, Marine soldiers are on standby after hearing the news of the meeting. Shanks boards Whitebeard's ship, as Marco orders the newcomers to go inside the ship. However, the message comes too late. Members of the Whitebeard pirates faint when Shanks walk pass them using his Supreme King Haki. Shanks apologizes, since it hard to stay calm on an enemy ship. Whitebeard orders his men to leave. When the crew is out of sight, Shanks prepared drinks of alcohol for the two captains.\nAfter a sip of the drink, Whitebeard said Shanks has made quite a leap as a pirate since Gol D. Roger's death, and asked about Buggy. Shanks replied that he hasn't heard anything about him since they parted ways at Loguetown after Roger's execution. Whitebeard was curious and asked why Shanks was missing an arm. He replied that he bet it on the new era. Shanks changed the subject to his scars, pointing to one scar across his face. Declaring it came from a member of Whitebeard's crew; Marshall D. Teach. He then asked Whitebeard to stop Ace's search for Teach. Whitebeard becomes furious, and says that Blackbeard needs to learn his lesson. He then throws his bottle at Shanks. Shanks draws his sword and said that the world will be thrown into chaos. The two clash swords, and the sky divides from the impact.\nThe next day, the Franky Family reads the newspaper on Enies Lobby, relieved that they were not mentioned. At the Galley-La Company, the Straw Hat Pirates react to the news, wondering why the Franky Family was not in the article. Sanji and Chopper are excited, as they can't wait for their new bounties. Meanwhile, Franky prepares the new ship for the Straw Hat Pirates. Iceburg arrives and offers to help, then Paulie, Tilestone, and Peepley Lulu appears and offers to help as well.

        "long_summary": "The scene opens on an early dawn, where all of the Straw Hat Pirates are asleep. Nami, who is above deck, wakes up and discovers an island in the distance. She calls out to the others, and after a humorous fight between Zoro and Sanji, Luffy awakens and climbs up onto the deck, sees the island, and gives a howl of joy.\nUpon landing on the island, Sanji notices that it's abundant with fruit. He suggests that they gather fruit as surplus, therefore, Nami has the remaining crew draw straws to see who gets to stay behind and watch the Going Merry. Luffy takes three, thinking that would make him smarter (which it did not), and in the end, Chopper ended up drawing the longest straw, so he got to stay behind. And so, Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp go to gather fruit while Nami goes to survey the island and draw a map of it, and Sanji follows her, swooning.\nThinking he's all alone on the ship, Chopper decides to play captain, giving out pretend orders to his fellow crew members. For a while, he has fun doing it until he discovers that the newest member of the crew, Nico Robin, was below him the whole time, reading a book. Chopper immediately gets freaked out remembering she was once a Baroque Works Officer Agent and that her specialty is assassination. He tells her he does not trust her and runs off into the ship (though Robin didn't seem to be paying attention). Once inside the ship, Chopper forgets about Robin for a bit and decides to make more Rumble Balls. While he does so, Robin enters and begins to make more coffee, though Chopper does not notice. Instead, he remembers the first time he made a Rumble Ball.\nA flashback occurs to before Chopper met the Straw Hat Pirates, back to when Chopper was still learning medicine. He was experimenting with some of Dr. Kureha's medicine until he heard her coming and accidentally dropped a few of them in. Acting quickly, but not exactly thinking, he pressed the ingredients together and tossed the ball in his mouth and swallowed it. His body then went under an unusual change as his arms suddenly became muscular and grew larger without him doing so on his own.\nThe flashback ends and Chopper begins to wonder how Dr. Kureha is doing. Then he finally noticed Robin was in the room the whole time and panics again. Thinking she was trying to learn the Rumble Ball's secrets and assassinate him he quickly eats a Rumble Ball and attacks breaking a barrel of water. He changes back into his Brain Point form and uses his Scope move to try to find Robin's weakness. Robin just laughs and uses her Devil Fruit power to tickle Chopper. She also says he's funny and cute to which Chopper insults her while doing a happy little dance. Then Robin hands him an empty barrel saying that since he broke the other barrel he should refill this barrel with more water. Chopper agrees and heads off into the island.\nMeanwhile, Luffy goofs around with monkeys and Usopp acts as though he was dying trying to gather fruit for this crewmates, making a dramatic scene. Zoro, while grumbling about being ordered by a woman (especially Nami), does what he is told and gathers lots of fruit by cutting them down from trees using his Three Sword Style. Nami, in the meantime, is busy surveying the island as Sanji showers her with compliments and expresses his love. Nami says he's in the way, and knocks him out of the way.\nWe then go back to Chopper, who, along with Robin go to gather water. When Chopper wonders why she came along she simply says it has been a while since she has gone for a walk like this. They finally reach a lake on the island and Chopper proceeds to fill the barrel. Robin sits in a nearby field of flowers. Chopper asks if she was really wanted by the Marines and all alone ever since she was 8, to which Robin replies \"Yes\". She goes on to say she survived by working for various pirates. She then asks Chopper about the person he was talking about before. Chopper describes Dr. Kureha as \"a woman who dresses like a pirate who is a doctor\".\nHe starts by saying he has spent 6 years learning how to be a doctor from her. In another flashback he is seen yet again messing with medicine when Dr. Kureha shows up. She asks if he's finished reading the pages he was supposed to read but Chopper complains, asking when he is going to do stuff doctors actually do. He then goes on to say he's already memorized all 200 of the books she gave him. Then suddenly, Dr. Kureha collapses. Chopper runs over to her, asking what's wrong. Dr. Kureha mentions that she might have gotten sick from one of her patients. She then says that he will have to treat her as a test and if he fails, she will die.\nChopper immediately puts her to bed and runs some tests. After checking several books and mixing medicine, he gives her a green sphere-shaped ball which Dr. Kureha takes. Chopper wonders if she's going to ask what's in it and she explains that there is no patient who has room in his/her heart to ask such a question; illnesses cannot be cured unless the patient completely trusts their doctor. She then eats the medicine. Chopper asks if she's any better, but Dr. Kureha says medicine does not work that fast and that she needs her rest. Later that night when Chopper was about to go out to get more water Dr. Kureha tells him he did a good job for someone like him.\nBack in the present, Chopper continues to say that was the only compliment he had gotten from Dr. Kureha in all those 6 years. So instead of acknowledging him as a doctor, she trusted him with her life; that's the kind of person Dr. Kureha is. Then Chopper realizes he's said too much but Robin had already gotten up and was ready to head back for the ship. Before she goes she tells Chopper she wishes she had someone to write to like he did. They went back together with Chopper carrying a full barrel of water (still in Brain Point).\nLater that night all the Straw Hats were eating the fruit Zoro gathered. Nami was disappointed with Luffy and Usopp, but congratulated Zoro on a job well done and said he'd get to collect fruit through the night. Sanji swooned but Zoro tells him to shut up. Before they got into a fight Nami holds them both back saying she was just kidding. While everyone laughs Luffy asked how Chopper's day was. Chopper said nothing special happened, then looks over at Robin, reading her book, and then added, \"...But it's been a great day!\"",
