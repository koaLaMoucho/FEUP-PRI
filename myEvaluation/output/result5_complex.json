        "title": "The Fighting Fish Strike! Break through the Deadly Iron Bridge",
        "air_date": "April 6, 2014",
        "short_summary": "The episode starts with a previous flashback of the Block B match, depictions including the King Punch and Bartolomeo's victory, much to the resentment of the crowd. Luffy is seen still hanging, and slingshots his way into the building after watching Bartolomeo win. He walks to the main entrance where the injured fighters are being carried off. He converses with an injured Bellamy, who acknowledges Luffy's strength and use of Haki. When he calls Luffy \"Straw Hat\", Bartolomeo hears this and is shocked. Later, it is announced that the Block C match is about to start.\nThe scene changes to Law and his group, who are about to cross the bridge. They are attacked by a school of Fighting Fish, but manages to get to Green Bit safely. Law is revealed to have Caesar's heart, the latter who is freed of his bonds for help. They also overhear strange voices at a point on the bridge. Green Bit is shown to be a dense jungle. \nThe plot shifts to Sanji's location, where he and Violet arrives at the next town. Sanji attacks some thugs in a warehouse and disposes of them easily. When the two recent lovebirds share a moment, Violet cuffs Sanji and is revealed to know Sanji's true identity as Black Leg, much to Sanji's astonishment.",
        "long_summary": "After the B block battle royale has finished Bellamy is being taken away on a stretcher and as he passes Luffy he comments that he has not changed a bit, Luffy on the other hand disagrees and that he has changed. Bellamy laughs at this and tells Luffy that he is the one that has changed, commenting on his exceptional Haki, he then tells Luffy that the whole rooting for him thing has crushed his pride and calls him \"Straw Hat\", which gets the attention of Bartolomeo who is standing a couple feet away.\nAt the bridge to Green Bit the \"Caesar Exchange Team\" is making their way across the iron bridge with 45 minutes left until the agreed upon time to exchange Caesar Clown. Unfortunately for them they are being attacked by a school of Fighting Fish who are so big that the iron bridge bends easily under their weight, which prompts Robin to wonder if they really are fish to which Law responds that they are, although Usopp disagrees and Caesar says they are the same as sea monsters. But Law does not seem very agitated by the fish and comments that it is not a problem that Usopp and Robin cannot handle, which confuses Usopp who believes that since Law is a Shichibukai he should be the one dealing with the fish. The school of fish starts to attack the bridge again forcing Robin and Usopp to deal with them, much to the happiness of Law, but realizing that there are too many fish to deal with they decide to make a run for it. Law also tells Usopp to take off Caesar's handcuffs so that he may help out, stating that Caesar will not run away as long as he is still in possession of Caesar's heart, which angers Caesar. Caesar helps out by defeating some of the fish while the other three run, Usopp then asks Law again as to why he is not fighting to which Law responds that he has to save all his energy for his fight with Doflamingo much to Caesar's shock.\nThe group then encounters some more bad luck as the next part of the bridge has been destroyed by the fish as well as the fact that it is surrounded by fog and what is worse another fighting fish jumps out of the water to attack the group. Fortunately the fish is stopped by some kind of fishing net much to the surprise of the group, voices are then heard on the other side of the bridge which makes the group wonder who it may be and Usopp calls out asking if anyone is on the other side and if they can help them get across. This however surprises and scares off the mysterious strangers, Law then makes Caesar use his gas powers to fly the group over to Green Bit much to the annoyance of Caesar.\nUpon arriving at Green Bit the group can not find any traces of the people who captured the fish and notice both the large number of wrecked ships and the giant, lush forest of Green Bit. Law then obverses that the southeast beach is just up ahead while Usopp notices a Marine ship that had crashed into the island and Robin uses her binoculars to confirm that the ship had damaged the plants and trees just recently. Robin also notes that the ship itself is not very damaged and Caesar starts to get paranoid that the exchange has been compromised and complains to Law who is wondering how to make his next move. Caesar begs Law to call off the exchange as the Marines are there and he is an enemy of the Marines, but Law refuses, noting that since he is an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates the Marines are now his enemy too and that he will need Robin and Usopp's skills to check out the forest and make sure there is nothing strange going on.\nMeanwhile, Sanji is still with Violet and finds some of Doflamingo's men who attempt to attack Violet, to which Sanji easily defeats them. Just then, Violet takes advantage of Sanji's affections and cuff him, revealing her true nature.",

They are all soon called to celebrate their victory at the Ryugu Palace with the banquet that was originally planned.\nAs the party begins to wind down, Robin asks and discusses a troubling and dangerous secret with King Neptune surrounding his daughter, Shirahoshi, the ship Noah, and the mysterious Joy Boy. Robin reveals the location of the ancient weapon from Skypiea she read two years ago being on Fish-Man Island and that Poseidon is on the island and deduces that the Mermaid Princess during the Void Century name was Poseidon and discovers that Shirahoshi is the now current ancient weapon, Poseidon.",

        "long_summary": "The royal family have made a decision to release the human slaves that were under Hody's control as they were only on this island for resting and traveling like other pirates. The rest of the New Fish-Man Pirates have also been released however they cannot go back to the Fish-Man District. They are ordered to live on the main island working for the king, under the supervision of the Neptune army stating they will not let the Fish-Man District get out of control again. From this day forward, the Fish-Man District will be sealed off and nobody will be allowed to enter. Neptune then asks Fukaboshi where Luffy is and he says Luffy ran away with the others.\nThe scene changes to the Straw Hats, who are flying above the island on the Thousand Sunny, still toting its bubble balloon. Shirahoshi is following along side the ship, and asks why they left in such a hurry. Zoro is mad at himself for fighting in that big of an open area. He tells Shirahoshi if they had stayed any longer, the people would have lifted them up like heroes, shivering at the thought. Zoro tells Shirahoshi that heroes have to share their alcohol, something which he does not want to do. Nami is appalled to hear Zoro reciting the same reason Luffy told Jinbe. Looking over her shoulder, Nami sees Luffy trying to convince Jinbe to join the crew. Jinbe replies that he cannot join, but is very happy to be asked. He tells them that he has some business that he has been putting off for a long time. After he has taken care of it, he promises he will come back to them and asked them to promise to invite him again, should they still see him fit to join. Sanji tells Luffy not to back Jinbe into a corner. Robin remarks that he has taken a liking to the crew. And Franky remarks that of course they would wait for a man who captivated Luffy as much as Jinbe did. Zoro then asks if they should head to the New World now. Shirahoshi is upset by their departure and asks them to stay so she can thank them all. Sanji uses this opportunity to propose staying at the Mermaid Cafe for a whole week. Usopp slaps him, saying there is only one reason Sanji would go there, but he does agree with him.\nAn Ammo Knight calls out to them, and then informs Neptune via baby Den Den Mushi that they caught up to the Straw Hats' ship. Through the Den Den Mushi, Neptune tells Luffy he wants to pick up where he left off with the banquet he initially promised. Luffy agrees, and tells Neptune he will get Hatchan and Camie as well.\nThe scene changes briefly to the Fish-Man District, where all the buildings have been wrapped in yellow tape. It then goes to Ryugu Palace, where Hody, his officers, and Vander Decken IX are all in a prison cell, still unconscious. At the main entrance to the island, guards are telling Surume to carry Wadatsumi to the far ends of the earth, telling the giant fish-man that they do not have a cell that can hold him, and that he is banished from the island. In Coral Hill, people are preparing food to bring to the palace banquet. They are carrying large racks of Sea King meat, boxes of seaweed cakes and other sweets, and alcohol by the cartload, enough to bathe in, as one fish-man put it.\nAt the palace, the Straw Hats and their guests are being carried on two large flounders to the banquet hall, a completely inundated room, which makes some of the Straw Hats nervous. Below them on the floor packed with soldiers, guards cheer and say the heroes have arrived. Luffy tells not to call them heroes as he is going to eat all the meat. Shirahoshi points out a stage in the front of the room to Luffy, and they notice someone standing on it. The woman on stage is introduced as Maria Napole, a singer called the diva of the ocean floor and the pride of the island. Maria Napole begins to sing, and her voice completely entrances Nami and Usopp, who feel as if they could melt from hearing it. Brook gets excited, as he notices Maria Napole's accompaniment, a jazz quintet. The music starts up, and then it is Sanji's turn to be in awe, as the Mermaid Cafe dancers are introduced. More mermaids come in carrying trays of food that they take to the Straw Hats and the rest of the people in attendance. Everyone is singing, dancing, cheering, and enjoying the festivities. Pappag is dancing with the Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets. Luffy and Jinbe are eating and laughing with two other mermaids. Zoro, Franky, and Hatchan toast gourds of alcohol. Sanji turns to stone in the arms of two mermaids, while another one grabs Brook and starts kissing him on the cheek. Luffy is then seen having a toast with Usopp, Neptune, Shirahoshi, Camie, Jinbe, and the Minister of the Right. All the soldiers raise their glasses high. Robin is seen laughing and drinking with the Minister of the Left. Brook is playing his guitar on stage with Maria Napole. Nami is seen celebrating her victory against Fukaboshi in a drinking contest, while Ryuboshi and Manboshi dance together.\nRobin is then seen standing just outside the banquet hall, when Neptune, a bit tipsy from drinking, stumbles out. He asks Robin what she wanted to talk to him about. Robin apologizes, saying she thought they would be able to be alone. Neptune, thinking she was coming on to him, starts telling Robin he could never betray the love he has for his wife, dead though she may be. Before he can go on, Robin cuts him off, asking who Joy Boy is. Neptune drops his gourd in surprise. Robin goes on to tell him that she read the poneglyph in the Sea Forest, and then asks Neptune who he was and what he was apologizing for. Neptune, instantly sobering up, is surprised Robin can read poneglyphs. Robin explains she is from Ohara and Neptune does not have to tell her anything he does not want to. Neptune says he will tell her what he knows stating he knows he can trust her.\nNeptune explains that Joy Boy was a person from the surface who lived during the Void Century. His message was for the Mermaid Princess living on the island at that time. It is an apology for breaking his side of a promise he made with the island. Neptune tells her he does not know the details of the promise, only that some day someone is supposed to come and carry out the promise made by Joy Boy. He explains it is a legend passed down in the royal family. Neptune says that their promise to Joy Boy was to watch Noah and keep it safe. Only when the promised time comes will Noah's purpose be known. Robin tells Neptune that she heard that Noah, after the events in and above Gyoncorde Plaza, was carried to the Sea Forest by Sea Kings. Robin asks Neptune if Joy Boy could control Sea Kings. Neptune tells her that ability belongs to the Mermaid Princess from then and now. Robin then concludes that Shirahoshi has the ability, confirming her theory. Neptune says she is right, and today that ability was fully awakened, which is not a good thing. Robin agrees. She then tells Neptune about the Poneglyph she read while in Skypiea two years ago. It gave the location of one of the ancient weapons, and said it was located on Fish-Man Island. She then asks Neptune if the Mermaid Princess from Joy Boy's time went by another name. Neptune starts to understand and begins to become fearful of what he's about to listen to. Robin tells him that Shirahoshi, by having the same ability, also inherited the same name as that princess. Her other name is the ancient weapon, Poseidon.",

        "short_summary": "The Marine Headquarters have started rebuilding, and the Marines had a meeting about Monkey D. Luffy. A Marine ship returned, but does not stop at the bay; instead, it shot at the island and began to circle it. The Marines began firing back, and discovered the ship to be carrying Jinbe, Luffy, and Rayleigh. After completing one circle around Marineford, the three disembark onto the island, with Jinbe and Rayleigh distracting the Marines while Luffy runs to the Ox Bell. While news reporters and other bystanders watch him, Luffy rings the bell sixteen times. He then dropped a bouquet of flowers into the largest crack in the ground, put his straw hat to his chest, and closed his eyes. The reporters excitedly photographed the incident, before Luffy, Rayleigh, and Jinbe leave the island.\nIn a meeting between Fleet Admiral Sengoku and Commander-in-Chief Kong at an unknown location, Sengoku tells his superior that he wants to retire from the Marines, and nominates Aokiji as his replacement. Koby wakes up in hospital, and learns that he now possesses the skill of Haki. Captain Smoker decided to go to the New World to go after Luffy, and asks Aokiji for a transfer to G-5. In the New World, Hawkins is seen being challenged by the pirate Brownbeard, and Eustass Kid is shown killing another pirate crew for displaying weakness and wishing to return to Paradise.",
        "long_summary": "The episode started with a view of Marineford being rebuilt. It showed a room full of vice-admirals as Lieutenant Commander Brannew talked about how Luffy is revealed to have survived the Summit War of Marineford and caused trouble again. A flashback followed, showing what happened two days ago. Two reporters are seen talking about how the Marines will go after the pirates involved in the war. Suddenly, some Marines see the warship which Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh are on. They made a full circle around Marineford before entering the bay (which is done in a funeral). After that, all three of them got to the plaza. Luffy then ran toward the Ox Bell and rang it sixteen times. Afterwards, he went to the largest crack from the battle in the ground and dropped a bouquet of flower in it and held his hat to his chest in a manner of paying respect. Reporters who were at the scene excitedly took photographs of the incident. Soon afterwards, a huge whale-shark appeared in the bay as Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh escaped from Marineford. After that, the newspapers printed the story and delivered it to all around the world, including Water 7, Sabaody Archipelago, Arabasta, and Foosha Village. The flashback ends as Brannew stated that it is humiliating for them to have let Luffy go.\nAfter that there was a scene showing the Five Elders discussing who should fill the vacancies in the Shichibukai positions and that Blackbeard was turning out to be a lot of trouble. They also comment on how those with the \"D\" are beginning to stir up trouble at the same time.\nThe next scene showed World Government Commander-in-Chief Kong and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku discussing Sengoku's retirement. Sengoku also recommended Admiral Aokiji to be the next Fleet Admiral.\nThe scene changed to Koby, Helmeppo, and a doctor in the hospital, discussing how Koby has obtained Observation Haki. Koby, talking within himself states that he feels different with this new power and he has to train more to become stronger; as strong as \"him\" (\"him\" referring to Luffy).\nAfter that, Admiral Aokiji and Smoker talked about what Luffy did at Marineford and about Smoker's transfer to the Marine base G-5.\nIn the New World, Eustass Kid and his crew were talking about Luffy's actions. Kid asked what the Ox Bell is. Killer explained what it is and the reason he thinks why Luffy rang it sixteen times.\nThe scene changes to Capone Bege's ship, which was being pulled up to a huge black ball in the sky, and Urouge's ship, which was approaching an island that was constantly being hit by lightning. An old woman offered to sell the crew some umbrellas. It then goes back to Kid as he declared that he will defeat Luffy in the New World.",

On the deck of the Marine Ship, Momonga spotted Captain Buggy's ship and it seems familiar to him. The Buggy Pirates spotted a Sea King that emerged adjacent to them and fell back into the sea. The Buggy Pirates were worried about their Captain that was taken away to Impel Down and wanted to free him, but it would be impossible for them to break inside. Alvida suggests that they should take a small boat if they want to get to Impel Down, so they conclude it would be too dangerous for them and quit the breakout attempt.\nPrisoners of Impel Down are being tortured; a new prisoner refuses to obey another prisoner's orders and starts a fight. Minotaurus stopped them and took them both to a different prison cell where they were eaten alive.\nMomonga's ship arrives at Impel Down through the Gate of Justice. Other Marine ships wait at the entrance of Impel Down. With all of the Marine ships, Luffy wonders if someone used a Buster Call. Momonga, Hancock, and Luffy, hidden under Hancock's cloak, departed the ship and enter Impel Down. Hancock struggled to put up with the Marine's love for her, but Momonga politely suggested to her not to petrify them. Around about this time, Buggy the Clown escaped from his cell on Level 1.\nPrisoners inside Impel Down were screaming. Hannyabal greeted Momonga and Hancock at the prison. Hannyabal told Momonga that he wanted to see Warden Magellan of Impel Down. Vice Jail Manager Domino escorts Hancock to a room where she could privately search Hancock as usual with all visitors. Domino took her search on Hancock seriously by making Hancock wear a Seastone handcuff to disable her Devil Fruit powers. Hancock accepted it, but her heart is beating from the tension.",

Koala's time with the Sun Pirates becomes fun as all the members (except Arlong) get along.\nKoala reaches her hometown and Fisher Tiger accompanies her. Koala reunites with her mother and cries after seeing her. She says to her mother that fish-men are nice people and says her goodbyes to Tiger stating she will never forget him with Tiger just smiling back at her.\nJust as Fisher Tiger leaves, he gets attacked by Marines with Rear Admiral Strawberry stating that someone from the village has informed him about his arrival, but the people on the island were alright with the Marines attacking him in exchange that Koala will not return to the Celestial Dragons as property. He tells Tiger that his crimes are assault and evasion. Jinbe hears gunshots and sees Marine battleships arrive and start attacking the ship while Arlong comments on how this is what humans are. Meanwhile, Jinbe says to Arlong that they need to go and find Fisher Tiger to bring him back safely. Arlong hijacks one of the Marines ships and Jinbe and the others manage to save Tiger. Tiger however, has sustained several injuries with blood all over him from the bullet wounds while Koala is unaware of what happened and her mother not telling her what happened.\nOn the ship they hijacked, Aladine tries to perform a blood transfusion to save Tiger because human blood is the same as fish-man's, but Fisher Tiger refuses to transfuse human blood into his body, stating it has the blood of humans who hate fish-men and that their blood is tainted and he will not give in to humans. Tiger explains to his crew that he was a slave and how he escaped and why he saved all the slaves. He says that both humans as well as fish-men need peace and admits that Otohime was right and that only the children of the next generation like Koala who aren't prejudiced, and asks his crew not to tell the island of what really happened nor of their grudge and hatred towards the humans for the sake of the future. He states that his body would reject that blood due to the demon that dwells inside his heart and he's tried but he just cannot ever love a human. Jinbe and Aladine beg Tiger to live and reassure him of how he's the hero of slaves and the greatest fish-man ever, giving Tiger comfort as he remembers his youth and the episode ends with Fisher Tiger's death and his crew grieving the loss of their beloved captain.",

The Franky Family, along with the Galley-La Company, Yokozuna, Oimo, and Kashii are still alive after their Buster Call encounter. When all hope seems lost, the Straw Hats hear a familiar voice that tells them to jump into the sea; the voice belongs to the Going Merry.",
        "long_summary": "The Marines of the Buster Call are stunned by the announcement of Rob Lucci's defeat. The thought of a pirate able to defeat one believed to be the most powerful, most ruthless Agent of the World Government fills all of them with dread at just what the Straw Hat Pirates are capable of performing. On the other side, the Straw Hats and their ally Franky are all reinvigorated by Luffy's victory, and they begin the push to clear the way for their escape. Suddenly, the Den Den Mushis are filled with voices of congratulations. Usopp suddenly stops and tries to track something with his ears: something familiar. To Franky's joy and relief, the voices are Zambai and the Franky Family along with Paulie and the Dock 1 shipwrights. While they had been surprised by a Buster Call attack and knocked over the edge, Paulie had used his Rope Action to throw up a net. The giants Oimo and Kashii had endured the brunt of the attack, allowing everyone to survive. With the Buster Call focused on the Straw Hats, Zambai assures them they can get away.\nEventually, the Vice-Admirals get the Marines over the shock and the fight resumes on the Bridge of Hesitation. But the Straw Hats and Franky continue their stubborn defense. So, the Buster Call decides to zero in on Luffy: too tired to even move from the spot where he fell in victory. Usopp is the first among the Straw Hats to realize Luffy's problem. First, the Marines destroy the escape ship. Thankfully, Sanji had evacuated Chopper, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe from it before the attack hit. The Straw Hats soon realize the Buster Call is redoubling its efforts and strategically cornering them: even at the expense of their own men. Eventually, they're isolated on the second column: unable to reach Luffy in the first column while the battleships take aim. Just then, Usopp hears that voice again. Soon the rest of the Straw Hats hear it, too, telling them to look down. Usopp finally recognizes it and proposes a bold gambit: jump into the sea. All the Straw Hats wonder what he could be thinking, particularly given Luffy, Robin, and Chopper's mutual problem with the sea. But Usopp insists they jump anyway: they have a friend down there. Once Robin conveys Luffy off the column with Cien Fleur: Delphinium, everyone else jumps. And to their amazement, a friend does wait below them, ready to receive them: the Going Merry.",

        "long_summary": "As Luffy continues running up the pathway created by Inazuma, with his Choki Choki no Mi powers, Helmeppo is crying over Koby, who apparently passed out after being punched by Luffy. The marines then attempt to shoot at Luffy, but Boa Hancock intervenes and stops them with her Slave Arrow move. Garp, Luffy's grandfather, continues shouting that Luffy must kill him in order to pass.\nLuffy then has a flashback of a training session where he attempts to continuously ward off fighting monkeys, but eventually gets tired and then asks his grandfather, \"Why do I have to keep fighting them, it only makes me hungry\". Garp says, \"So that you'll be a strong marine soldier\". Luffy defiantly shouts that he wants to be a pirate.\nAs he continues running, Luffy has yet another flashback, again training. This time he is attacking a Gorilla, but fails to hit the Gorilla. He attempts a Gomu-Gomu no move, but fails and snags his arm into a near-by tree. Garp helps him down and fixes his straw hat. As his grandfather does so Luffy says, \"I'm going to become a pirate, not just a pirate, the Pirate King\". Angered by his statements Garp becomes frustrated and blames Red-haired Shanks for influencing Luffy into becoming a pirate and thus dismisses the Gorilla saying, \"I must beat some character into my grandson\". Directly proceeding to kick Luffy. He then carries Luffy on his back speaking to him of himself and his wishes.\nAs the flashback ends Garp shouts, \"Luffy, I now consider you my enemy!\" Luffy then goes into Gear Second and gets ready to unwillingly punch his grandfather, who is also preparing to punch his grandson, but in the midst of the commotion he is caught up in his loving heart for Luffy and gets knocked out by his own grandson.\nThe pathway then begins to crumble, as Garp continues to fall to the ground head first. Luffy then jumps through the rumble, making his way to the platform where Ace is being held. When Luffy attempts to unhandcuff his brother, Ace, Admiral Kizaru splits the key in half. Mr. 3 then realizes that its Luffy and makes a key for him. As Luffy uncuffs his brother Admiral Sengoku transforms into a large Buddha like figure using his devil fruit powers. He then punches them, but Luffy expands using Gear Third.\nGaldino, Luffy, and Ace begin to fall from the platform after the punch from Sengoku. Meanwhile all the marines fire cannons at them. They seem to be directly hit, but Ace uses his devil fruit abilities to save them. Ace is free and Luffy, Galdino and Whitebeard are alive.",

        "long_summary": "Freed from her sea stone handcuffs by Franky, Robin returns to her normal self. With no way back, the two decide to capture the ship Spandam had intended to use to bring Robin to the Marine headquarters. Unfortunately, Vice-Admiral Doberman, one of the respondents to the Buster Call, arrives. His battleship takes a shot at the stockade and blows a hole in it. The next attack by Doberman is shooting at the Tower of Justice, causing its already broken upper half to crush down into the waterfall. Usopp narrowly escapes as it crashes into the abyss below and demolishes the damaged drawbridge with it. Zoro and Sanji realize that because the Gates of Justice are fully open, the waterfalls surrounding the island have vanished because the water current no longer has to go around them. This will allow the battleships to take a clear path into Enies Lobby. The resulting loud noise created reaches Luffy and Rob Lucci beneath the Bridge of Hesitation. Luffy's use of Gear 2 begins to take a toll on him. He pants heavily throughout its activation, and then Gear 2 completely wears off during his fight. Lucci figures out Luffy is doping his blood by using his legs as pumps\u2014a move that would cause a normal person's heart to explode from the excess blood pressure. It is a move only Luffy can use due to the resilience of his unique rubber inner organs, but it risks shortening his lifespan. Luffy does not care about the damage he is doing to his body if CP9 is going to tear apart his life by taking his friends away, and yells at Lucci for making light of his crew's dire situation as if it were a game. Anticipating that the Straw Hats would emerge through the underground passage, Lucci tears a hole into a wall of the underwater chamber, flooding it and the passage. Meanwhile, Nami catches up to Kokoro, the unconscious Chopper, Chimney, and Gonbe in the passageway, with Zoro and Sanji about to do the same, none knowing a torrent of water is headed straight for them. Spandam desperately calls on all the Marines he can find to save his skin and try to stop Robin from escaping, but she and Franky easily defeat the reinforcements. However, both sides are now out of time. From the horizon, the rest of the Buster Call ships arrive and target the entire island, only ignoring Nico Robin on orders from Admiral Aokiji. Oimo and Kashii flee Enies Lobby with the Galley-La shipwrights and the Franky Family in tow as cannon fire wastes the judicial island. Robin looks on with great fear as her old nightmare comes back for revenge.",

Otohime comments that they could never have stopped him after hearing the voice in his heart. Tiger's attack on Mary Geoise is spread throughout the whole island and everyone celebrates his attack and freeing the slaves, calling him the hero of Fish-Man Island. Otohime tries to get others to sign her petition for migrating to the human world, only to be turned down by the people due to them celebrating Fisher Tiger and his attack and they all leave. At the Fish-Man District a young Hody Jones and New Fish-Man Pirates all comment on Tiger's attack, wishing to have joined them. They cheer them on believing that their goal is killing humans.\nAt the Sun Pirates, Hachi tells the boss that there is a Marine ship coming and the crew prepare for battle. Arlong leads the attack and the Marines are having a hard time attacking them due to them being underwater. Rear Admiral Kadar demands that they return the slaves and the Marines are being attacked under the ship. A Marine states to Jinbe that it's a crime for freeing slaves and that the Fish-Men should never go against humans. Jinbe, enraged, brutally assaults the human and asks why freeing slaves is a crime while slavery is not a crime and asks Otohime if this is the peace they can have with humans. Tiger begins his attack on the Marines and Kadar demands that he gives back the slaves only for Tiger to defeat him with a kick and ask what slaves are on the ship, stating that if they have a slave mark, then they should be found but due to the sun mark they cannot tell which is which. Tiger declares he will not have them killed, but will take their belongings and Arlong tries to kill a human for stating that being a human is sinful and Tiger tries to stop him but is too late.\nAt Marineford, Vice Admiral Borsalino is hearing a report from Rear Admiral Strawberry, about the crew and how powerful they are, for defeating Kadar and how dangerous they are in the water. Back at the Sun Pirates, Tiger is scolding Arlong for killing that Marine despite his protests. Jinbe states that they are out to kill the crew and they have to step up to be ready for them. Tiger states that killing them will make them as bad as the humans, stating this is not for revenge and neither what he did at Mary Geoise. He states that the Sun Pirates are about freedom and liberation and that they will never kill anyone. Arlong protests stating they should kill humans to make an example out of them and scare them only for Jinbe to punch him in the head for disobedience. At night, Tiger has a private talk with Jinbe and tells him that the \"demons\" that dwell within his heart are the most terrifying. Over time, as Otohime continues to try gaining supporters for her petition, Tiger and Jinbe gain bounties of 230 million and 76 million, respectively.\nThree years later, on an island, Tiger would be asked by the people to take a former slave named Koala home and agreed while Koala would thank Tiger for what he did. Arlong is disgusted for having a human on board and assaults her for constantly smiling while Hachi holds him back. She gets up and rips some of her pants and starts cleaning the deck while blood is coming out of her nose, confusing the crew and even Arlong. Jinbe asks what she's doing and she just continually apologizes and states she will not stop working and will not cry so she will not be killed. Jinbe is shocked and takes pity on how traumatized she is and realizes how afraid she is of them because she wants to go home. Aladine states that she's acting like this because she may have seen other slaves been killed for taking breaks or not smiling and thinks she cannot trust anyone. Tiger decides to take her to his room and marks her with the sun symbol stating while it's harsh, she cannot forget the fact she was once a slave but can hide the mark. She later wakes up and apologizes for passing out, but did not cry, causing Tiger to yell stating it's alright to cry, stating they are not like the stupid World Nobles. He takes a gun and throws it overboard to prove a point and states that they will not kill anyone and tells his crew that they'll take her home no matter what, causing Koala to finally cry.",

However, Vice-admiral Borsalino is there and easily defeats Arlong. Arlong states he's here to kill all the humans that sold Tiger out and how Tiger is now dead while Borsalino just states now he's gonna take him with him. At the G-2 Base, Arlong is being interrogated and yells how if not for human's blood being the cause of Tiger's death he would still be alive and states that humans killed Fisher Tiger. The next day Jinbe is reading the newspaper and notes how Arlong left out several details and lied to the Marines. Aladine states he did so that Tiger's reputation and pride would stay safe. Jinbe, agreeing with Aladine, states that they have to continue on now and prepare for battle and states that they will not kill anyone. At Marineford, Strawberry tells Borsalino about how dangerous Jinbe is.\nAt the palace, Neptune and Otohime are reading a letter from Jinbe about the truth of Tiger and how they support Otohime's cause. Otohime gains more confidence and strives to gain more peace with humans and merfolk. She continues to gain more signatures, but the citizens are even more distrusting towards humans due to the news about Tiger and how they just cannot trust humans because of this. After the day, Shirahoshi at age 4 and the princes comfort her from her long day. Jinbe goes on to state how she continued to save humans and teach children about the outside world and continuing to gain more signatures. One day, a citizen asks how many signatures Otohime has. Otohime states there are 5 million people on the island and she only has 1,000 signatures, but still has a long way to go. The citizen and others ask for their signatures back, and so do some of the children having been told so by their parents. They state that they listen to her because she's queen, but it's the humans and cannot live with them and are tired of her speeches. They take all the signatures and the Minister of the Right can only take pity on the queen. At the palace, Otohime returns and is crying to herself with Neptune listening in depression. The next day, Otohime, drunk, makes a broadcast announcement for the whole island about how they choose to live on the bottom of the surface because of how there's a little light and air to live off of. She goes on to state how the children sneak off to view the outside world and how the people of the island are afraid of change for the world and if they can change that, then maybe they can see all the true wonders of the world. This seems to have an effect on the people.\nOne day, Jinbe receives a message from the World Government about becoming a Shichibukai. Macro states that because his bounty is now at 250 million and they are afraid of him. Jinbe actually decides to take them up on this offer. At the palace, Jinbe is speaking with Neptune about his decision to become a Shichibukai to promote peace for merfolk and Neptune is grateful, stating Otohime would appreciate this and this is what Tiger would have wanted, however, Hody Jones does not like this.\nJinbe decides to have Arlong released from Impel Down and the crew all rejoice that he's back. Arlong decides to leave since Jinbe is now a dog of the government and will take his Arlong Pirates to do what he wants and if Jinbe wants to stop him, he will have to kill him and yells that he will become the rage of Fish-Men. Jinbe, finally losing his temper with Arlong, brutally beats him half-dead with his fists, but, due to everything they've been together, cannot bring himself to kill him and lets him go. Aladine reassures him that if Arlong decides to do anything funny, they'll be there to stop him while Jinbe shows his frustration on how Arlong cannot understand Tigers wish. The episode ends with Arlong's and Macros crew leaving the Sun Pirates.",

The executioners prepare to execute Ace, but Crocodile intervenes, saying he can kill Whitebeard later and he does not want the Marines to win. Aokiji attacks Luffy, but Marco knocks him away before he can finish him off. Mr. 3 hides in the passageways below Marineford, having managed to escape Aokiji's freezing. The Whitebeard pirates rush toward the opening in the wall, prompting the Marine forces to fire their cannons at them, but Whitebeard commands a submerged paddle ship to surface, and Oars propels it into the plaza with the pirates on board. As Whitebeard's forces reach the plaza, Sengoku and Garp prepare to fight them.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy kicks the frozen mast, and the shrapnel hit the admirals, but to no effect. Both Koby and Helmeppo are greatly shocked at Luffy's action and comment on how the admirals will kill him. The ice shards resulting from Aokiji's defense create a fog, which Luffy uses to activate Gear Second and pass through the admirals. His efforts are futile as Kizaru kicks him at lightspeed. Sengoku then orders for Ace to be executed, much to the surprise of Whitebeard, Jinbe, Marco and the commanders. However, the executioners are struck by Crocodile's sand, shocking and angering Sengoku. When confronted, he claimed \"he does not want them to taste victory\" and his head is then sliced by Donquixote Doflamingo, who claimed he is \"jealous that he joined with Whitebeard\". Crocodile soon recovers, and both fight as Crocodile claims he \"will team up with nobody\". Luffy is then attacked by hordes of Marines, and defeats a high ranking Marine with ease. Akainu is about to intercept Luffy but Aokiji pins Luffy down, and claims he owed a favor to Garp, but that Luffy has chosen \"his own path of death\". Boa Hancock wants to interfere, but Marco proves to be faster and kicks Aokiji away. Galdino, who has infiltrated deep inside Marineford, believes he is being chased by the Marines when an alert is announced and falls in panic. The Whitebeard Pirates decide to swim across the boiling water toward Oars Jr. and Sengoku is immediately alerted. In a desperate attempt, high ranking Marines give the order to shoot cannon balls at them, but the lower ranking Marines begin to panic as the pirates keep advancing without hesitation. Soon after a hidden coated ship appears and takes the pirates in, much to the Marines' surprise and Sengoku's annoyance. The Marines order to shoot down the ship, but it is too fast. Sengoku orders them to shoot at Oars, but he is already able to pull the ship out of the water, allowing the pirates a safe pass through the plaza. Garp soon commends Whitebeard for his tactics and Oars is gunned down and falls unconscious, telling Whitebeard to save Ace. Whitebeard enters the plaza, and unleashes a massive shock wave with his weapon. Whitebeard orders his pirates to save Ace and destroy the Marines. Knowing that Whitebeard is about to attack with all his forces, both Sengoku and Garp decide to fight.",

        "long_summary": "Shanks stands firm before Akainu while Garp recognizes the former for corrupting his grandson into being a pirate. Almost all the pirates and Marines are surprised, while an amused Teach catches notice. The Red-Haired Pirates had arrived. While Law's submarine sails away, his crew members race to save Luffy and Jinbe who are rapidly losing blood. As they prepare for transfusion, Bepo reminds his captain they need to go underwater soon. The Marines learn that Shanks' crew had a run-in with one of the other Four Emperors, Kaido, yesterday. Buggy freaks out at seeing Shanks, as the latter is surprised to see him but the clown pirate doesn't want to be in Shanks' presence. Shanks throws his straw hat to Buggy for the clown to loan to Luffy. The clown pirate yells that he doesn't want anymore favors from the red-haired pirate. Shanks also says he has got a treasure map that could suit Buggy fancy. When Shanks moves to give the map to another, Buggy quickly decides to comply to his former crewmate's request and get the Straw Hat to Luffy. Lucky Roux wonders if Shanks is going to let Luffy leave without a chance to greet him.\nWith their times flying by, Shanks thinks back to his first meeting with Luffy, and how he sacrificed his arm to save him from the Sea King. He begins to wonder what Luffy would say at their moment. Bepo calls to Law for attention as they don't want the Marines to hit their submarine hard, or for the captain to drown. Buggy then races with the Straw Hat and slings it into Law's hand. The pirate surgeon and Bepo head inside the submarine and it begins to submerge. With the two racing to Luffy's side, Shanks knows that his reunion with Luffy will have to wait. He also thinks back to when he gave his Straw Hat to Luffy and expects it returned in good condition and will meet whence Luffy becomes a great pirate. Once the submarine submerges, Shanks says he can't see Luffy again just yet. Law begins his operation as Akainu ran both Jinbe and Luffy through, but is more worried about the emotional scars that Luffy has suffered.\nMeanwhile, Akainu curses Shanks for allowing Luffy's escape while his comrades are determined to finish Luffy with Aokiji firing an Ice Age, threatening to freeze the water. With Luffy's pulse steadying, the submarine is struck, but Jean Bart makes the submarine go full speed for a dive. Just as the ice is inches from giving the submarine a fatal blow, it evades. Bepo breathes a sigh of relief. However, Kizaru fires a Yasakani Sacred Jewel shower, rocking the submarine heavily. Hancock tries to protest. When he stops, the light admiral says that if Law's group survived, luck may not be on the side of the Marines. Hancock hijacks a Marine ship and tells the crew she will capture Luffy on her authority as a Warlord. Shanks stares at the horizon as Luffy leaves the area.\nBuggy lashes out at Shanks as the treasure map was all a trick. The Red Haired Pirate Captain says he was just having fun with his old friend and is happy to see him again. The Clown pirate reacts angrily to this and reminds Shanks that if he hadn't spotted him with the Bara Bara no Mi or the map, he would not lose it. Buggy yells that Shanks is a prodigy when it comes to making him angry. He also declares war on Shanks, as his impressed followers internally promise to serve him forever. Shanks leaves Buggy to handle his business with the war, as Buggy protests this but soon realizes he could hitch a ride with Shanks' crew to safely leave Marineford.\nShanks walks past Marco, informing him that there is no further need for combat and he must resign. Mihawk walks past the Marines as they protest, he firmly tells them while he agreed to fight Whitebeard's crew, Shanks was another matter telling the Marines to quit and he leaves the area. Shanks warns to everyone present on Marineford that their fighting is becoming pointless. Every blow one party lands, it goes back to their own as well. He draws his sword as he tells them that if anyone wants another fight, the red-haired pirate dares the pirates and marines to fight him. The Marines are in shock, while Teach's crew stands in idle. Shanks confronts Teach and asks if he wants to escalate things. An amused Teach compliments Shanks for the scars that he left on Shanks' eye. Just as both crews prepare to duel, Teach laughs as he announces to his crew to resign. He declares he already had what he wanted and doesn't wish for another fight with Shanks, at least not yet. The Blackbeard pirates pull out and leave the area.\nSengoku shifts back to his human form and Shanks sheathes his sword. With Ace and Whitebeard dead, Shanks tells everyone to accept the losses, honor the fallen and leave with their dignity intact. Whitebeard's crew mourn the loss of their captain and the Marines tend to their fallen. At Sabaody, Reuder remarks that the war seems to be ending.\nShanks requests that Ace and Whitebeard be given a proper burial and doesn't want their corpses paraded through like trophies. With the Marines ultimately victorious, they want to string their dead enemies up as proof of their triumph. However, Sengoku consents and allows Shanks to give Ace and Whitebeard the proper burial, something that the pirate thanks. Sengoku then orders the injured to be tended to and announces the war is finally over. As the wounded are gathered, Garp orders the soldiers not to lose anymore good men while he sheds tears at his loss.\nShanks then looks upon the bodies of Ace and Whitebeard as he sadly looks on.",

The episode ends as the giant shockwave from the attack approaches Whitebeard.",
        "long_summary": "Ace apologizes that he did not listen to his crew when they warned him not to go after Blackbeard, but they insist that Whitebeard told him to go\u2014that they look after their own. Doflamingo and Moria are excited for battle, but Mihawk and Hancock stay quiet. Hancock is disgusted by the hot headed men, with the exception of Luffy who she prays is alright.\nThe water levels strangely recede. To this same affect Luffy's ship is pulled back from the Gates of Justice, and Jinbe is the only one who realizes why. Luffy panics, but Jinbe assures him that they'll make it on time, to Buggy's disbelief. In an apparently miraculous turn of events, the water rushes forward pushing them quickly ahead. However a large shadow suddenly looms over the ship.\nWe cut back to Marineford to a tense standoff between the pirates and marines. The water levels rise, and off in the distance, giant waves are spotted. The waves look like they are about to drown the whole of Marineford, but Aokiji jumps up and freezes them with his Hie Hie no Mi's power, \"Ice Age\". He attacks Whitebeard with ice arrows that Whitebeard quickly disposes of along with hitting Aokiji. Aokiji breaks into pieces and falls toward the water which he quickly freezes as well. It traps all the ships in the bay, but the pirates use the frozen water as a foothold and charge forth. The marines also start their attack and everything quite quickly dissolves into all out battle, Smoker and Tashigi included. The admirals show their faces, although the men tell Tsuru she can just sit back and relax. She ignores them, telling them it did not matter how far back she went, there was no escaping this fight.\nSquard, one of Whitebeard's loyalist supporters, tells his own crew to charge forth. Meanwhile it seems the Seven Warlords are finally ready to get involved. Surprisingly, it is Mihawk who seems ready to jump into battle. It appears he wants to see the distance between Whitebeard and himself. Although there are others, such as Vista who would also like to test themselves against \"The World's Greatest Swordsman\". Mihawk unsheathes his meito sword, \"Yoru\" and slashes it at Whitebeard.",

        "short_summary": "Big Mom contacts Kaidou, informing him that she will be going to Wano Country to take Luffy's head. Kaidou objects, having his own grudge against Luffy.\nBack at the Red Port, Garp has a conversation with Gion, Hina, and Tokikake.",
        "long_summary": "Big Mom contacts Kaidou through Den Den Mushi, telling him that she would be visiting Wano Country to personally kill Luffy. Kaidou objects, claiming that his grudge against Luffy was greater. Kaidou had previously operated a SMILE fruit operation with Donquixote Doflamingo, but Luffy destroyed the factory, ending the operation. Kaidou wanted to be the one to personally kill Luffy. However, Big Mom refuses to back down, suggesting that they form an alliance against him.\nMeanwhile, in New Marineford, the Marines manage to wiretap the call, learning about the Emperors' plans to kill Luffy in Wano Country. Kizaru suggests Marine intervention, but Sakazuki refuses, since Wano Country was not part of the World Government and was thus outside their jurisdiction.\nGarp has a conversation with Hina on the matter, and tells the story of Luffy's adventures after the Marineford War. Immediately after the war concluded, Luffy returned to Marineford and rang the Ox Bell, signalling the beginning of a new era and hinting at his crew members to meet again in two years. The Straw Hats trained separately, reunited at Sabaody two years later, and resumed their adventures.\nGarp continues the story. The Straw Hats reached Fish-Man Island to cross the Red Line. After defeating Hody Jones and thwarting their coup d'\u00e9tat against the Ryugu Kingdom, Luffy would personally pick a fight with Big Mom herself. He would continue his adventures in Punk Hazard. During his struggle against mad scientist Caesar Clown, Luffy formed an alliance with Trafalgar Law of the Heart Pirates, planning to take down another Emperor, Kaidou. On his next adventure, Luffy infiltrated Dressrosa and clashed against its tyrannical king, Donquixote Doflamingo. During this struggle, not only did Straw Hat put an end to Kaidou's SMILE fruit operation, seven powerful crews would join Straw Hat's army.\nLuffy continued onto the island of Zou. There, the Mink tribe and the Kouzuki Family would both join Luffy's alliance with Law to take down Emperor Kaidou. However, Sanji was forced to split away from the crew due to a political marriage. The crew would split into two groups, of which Luffy's group went to Totto Land to fight against the Big Mom Pirates and rescue Sanji. Luffy dealt a heavy hit to the Big Mom Pirates because he destroyed Big Mom's castle, foiled a political marriage and an assassination attempt, and took down their most formidable fighter, Katakuri. Although the Straw Hats escaped Totto Land, Big Mom continues to pursue Luffy for revenge.\nBack in present day, Shanks infiltrates Pangaea Castle and speaks with the Five Elders. He wishes to speak to them about a certain pirate.",

        "long_summary": "While the rest of the world is finding out about the Straw Hats' new bounties and events at Enies Lobby, Blackbeard is seen reading an earlier account of the Straw Hat\u2019s activities at Enies Lobby, commenting that their bounties should rise afterwards. Lafitte wonders if the Straw Hats hijacked a Sea Train from Water 7 to get to Enies Lobby. Van Auger comments that Water 7 isn\u2019t too far from the Blackbeard Pirate\u2019s current location and thinks they\u2019ll cross paths again while Doc Q suggests that fate may allow them to meet again and take action when it happens. Jesus Burgess laughs while carrying a sack and asks what they\u2019re waiting for, and Blackbeard responds in agreement and announces his intent to stop the Straw Hats before the Marines can.\nMeanwhile, the townspeople are seen defeated and scattered around. As Blackbeard's crew walks ahead, they pass by an observing Ace, who is seen squatting in a roof near them. Ace calls out Blackbeard by referencing him as Teach, stating that they need to talk. The narration then plays, confirming that history-changing events are taking place in this small island called Banaro Island, three days before the Straw Hat\u2019s fate and bounties were revealed to the world.\nBlackbeard looks up in surprise and addresses him as Commander Ace, to which Ace responds by stating that he has no right to call him that anymore. Lafitte comments that this must be the famous pirate \u201cFire Fist\u201d Ace that they\u2019re witnessing. Ace confirms Lafitte\u2019s address and then notes that Blackbeard is a captain of his own crew now. Blackbeard responds that it\u2019s been a while since they interacted, and teases Ace if he\u2019s been looking for him. Ace responds to Blackbeard to cut his act and that there is only one reason for him to be here. In response, Blackbeard asks him to join his crew instead of fighting, claiming that he has the perfect plan to become the Pirate King while mentioning that Whitebeard\u2019s days are numbered. Blackbeard further mentions that he plans to head to Water 7 to kill Luffy and present it as a gift to the World Government.\nA surprised Ace then reveals to Blackbeard that he won\u2019t let him kill his younger brother. Upon refusing to join Blackbeard\u2019s crew, Auger shoots Ace with a bullet harmlessly piercing through his Mera Mera no Mi\u2019s Logia Devil Fruit abilities. Ace smirks and comments that Blackbeard\u2019s crew weren\u2019t taught manners, to which Ace retaliates at Auger with Fire Gun. From behind, Burgess launches a hotel towards Ace to which he burns up with Flame Commandment Fire Pillar. The rubble lands near Blackbeard who yells at Auger and Burgess, warning them that they\u2019re not strong enough to fight Ace by themselves. As Burgess apologizes, Ace launches Fire Fist at Blackbeard\u2019s crew, managing to hit their captain. Engulfed in flames, Blackbeard rolls around in pain while his unscathed crew runs to his aid. As Auger fans the flames out, Ace walks towards them. Blackbeard dismisses his crew\u2019s help and tells them to stand back. As Blackbeard recovers, he understands Ace\u2019s intent to finish him, before admitting to the crime of murdering their former crew mate, fourth division commander Thatch.\nBlackbeard reveals that he had no choice but to kill Thatch in order to obtain the Yami Yami no Mi, a Devil Fruit he\u2019s been chasing after for decades and so the rule goes in Whitebeard\u2019s ship: whoever finds a devil fruit can claim it as theirs to eat. Blackbeard emphasizes that he memorized the shapes and colors of many Devil Fruits until he recognized the Yami Yami no Mi sitting in Thatch\u2019s hand. He further states that by lying low in Whitebeard\u2019s crew, he would have the best shot at finding it someday. Blackbeard tells Ace to witness the power he gained, stating its power is unique among Logia types. With his right hand, Blackbeard forms a black pillar into the sky and tells Ace that just as he is made out of fire, his own body is made out of darkness. The townspeople catch sight of Blackbeard\u2019s dark pillar, describing it as the weird black smoke from before. Seeing no other options, the townspeople run away in fear.\nBlackbeard continues his fruit\u2019s display, stating that it is said to be the most powerful of them all. He tells Ace to witness his power, and Ace urges him on. Meanwhile, Blackbeard\u2019s crew is seen running away, with Burgess stating that their captain may kill them if they don\u2019t get away in time. Doc Q falls over and is dragged away by Burgess and Auger. Stronger subsequently collapses behind them, and Burgess proceeds to yell at him for also falling down.\nThe pillar descends into Blackbeard\u2019s position and then spreads out, engulfing the ground of the town. The remaining townspeople observe the darkness spreading further out, wondering if it\u2019ll suck them up as well. More of them run away, as Blackbeard continues his speech about his power: darkness is like gravity, and it swallows everything around it. Ace acknowledges his claims, but mentions its not surrounding him. Blackbeard tells him this is intentional, as he wants him to see the power of the Yami Yami no Mi. Blackbeard uses Black Hole, which destroys and sucks up the entire town. The townspeople watch in fear as Blackbeard continues his speech, stating his power crushes and compresses everything his darkness touches. Moments later, the townspeople see the vast emptiness that is left of their town. With his left hand swallowing the remnants of the dark hole, he uses Liberation, and a black pillar forms out of his back and throws out everything the dark hole had just swallowed up and destroyed.\nBlackbeard marvels at his power, stating that this was worth killing Thatch over before pausing to see green balls of light appear towards him, which is Ace\u2019s Firefly Fiery Doll. Blackbeard is engulfed in flames and withers in pain, to which Ace comments that he understands his darkness power, but not at his sensitivity to pain. Ace states that as a Logia type, the flames should not hurt, let alone hit Blackbeard. Blackbeard\u2019s power absorbs the flames and responds that his power absorbs everything around him including pain, stating that he is unable to simply turn into an element and dodge an attack. He claims the pain he then receives is much greater than what a normal human feels. Even so, he states the tradeoff is worth utilizing the power, stating that there is one more thing his power can swallow. With his left hand, he summons Black Vortex, which utilizes gravity to pull a Devil Fruit user into his grasp. Ace\u2019s hat flies away as he is being pulled in, and comments that the power is indeed strong. Blackbeard appears before him, being able to grab Ace\u2019s shoulder and both of them realize what had just happened. Blackbeard punches Ace and sends him flying towards the rubble, commenting that it must have been a while since the last time he was hurt like that. Blackbeard finally states that his power can even absorb Devil Fruit powers, so long as he is in contact with the user.\nWiping blood off his mouth, Ace states then all he has to do is avoid contact. Blackbeard reminds him that gravity is stronger than he thinks, and he summons Black Vortex. As Ace is pulled in, he uses St. Elmo\u2019s Fire, sending two pillars of fire through Blackbeard. Blackbeard manages to grab Ace anyways and punches him away, before dealing with his new damage again. His power absorbs the fire pillars away, and Ace realizes that Blackbeard\u2019s power will be more difficult to manage than he expected. Ace fires Cross Fire at Blackbeard and the impact falls a giant rock named Banana Rock which the townspeople observe. The townspeople fear that the ongoing combat may destroy their island in its entirety. Meanwhile, Auger and the rest of the crew are watching from afar, as he comments that unlike other users in combat, Ace isn\u2019t handicapped to only utilizing his Logia abilities.\nAfter some moments, both Blackbeard and Ace are seen in exhaustion, with Ace on his knees while Blackbeard stands tall. Blackbeard once more asks Ace to join his crew, stating that it would be a waste to finish him here. Ace struggles but stands up, stating that if he joined, he can never call himself a man again. Ace says no matter what happens, he won\u2019t submit and live a life of regrets. Blackbeard dismisses his morals, stating that they\u2019re meaningless if he is dead. Blackbeard understands that Ace won\u2019t change his mind, and summons a black pillar towards him. In response, Ace summons a giant fireball at the tip of his finger, the Great Flame Commandment Flame Emperor. Blackbeard remarks that this is the sun facing against darkness and that only one can win. Ace responds that he will make Whitebeard the King, or he will die trying. The two charge at each other with their massive attacks and from afar, the island is seen with their attacks colliding in the center, before the scene shines away into a view of Ace\u2019s hat lying on the ground. The narrator concludes that this clash would set off a chain of events that would change the world.",

        "long_summary": "Inside the Whole Cake Chateau, Sanji and Pudding rehearse their vows with a priest. The priest states that the marriage will be sealed with a kiss, and Sanji notes that this will be when Pudding attempts to shoot him. However, when Pudding talks to him, he is quickly taken aback by her beauty and struggles to remind himself of who she truly is.\nOutside the wedding venue, Bege checks on the Straw Hats' status, but finds Luffy leaning out of his body to look around. Luffy opens up the doors in Bege's body and jumps across them before being punched and taken back by Nami, and Bege remarks that he maybe should have killed them. Vito then calls out from atop the venue wall, remarking in excitement that Morgans is talking to Judge. He then reveals that Katakuri, Smoothie, Perospero, Compote, Daifuku, and Oven of the Charlotte Family are all in attendance, noting their strength and remarking that they will not be good enemies to have. The gate homie nearby is taken aback to hear that, and Bege tells Vito and Gotti to go check downstairs. Inside the Whole Cake Chateau, two of the Fire Tank Pirates are disguised as cooks and report to Bege that the cooks are enjoying a banquet after having made the wedding cake. With all passages and signals to the wedding venue closed off, the Fire Tank Pirates go off to complete their next task. However, they are stopped by a drunk cook, who notes that he does not recognize them. However, the cook is struck down by Gotti as he and Vito arrive.\nInside the wedding venue, some Chess Soldiers carry the portrait of Mother Carmel and place it on the table in front of Big Mom. She is joyful to see it, but no one else knows who Carmel is. When one person asks how she is related to Big Mom, Big Mom shouts at him to not intrude on her memories as she releases her Supreme King Haki and knocks him out. Her guests then present her with gifts that they acquired from exotic locations, and Morgans asks about the report of her acquiring a great undersea treasure. Big Mom confirms this, revealing the Tamatebako from Fish-Man Island, which she plans to open during the feast after Pudding's wedding. Outside, Bege's men return to him with their mission completed, and Bege tells Caesar to come out of his body with the mirror. Caesar does so, and Bege briefs him on his role, telling him that he will be flying the mirror into the venue once they assassinate Big Mom so they can escape. At this point, the gate homie realizes that the Fire Tank Pirates are plotting something, but her face is then immediately sliced off by Gotti. Bege then goes inside his body to check on the Straw Hats, only to find everyone except Jinbe sleeping. Jinbe says that they have gone a while without sleep, and promises to wake them up ten minutes before the wedding starts. With everything ready, Bege has his subordinates enter his body and goes into the venue, saying that there is no turning back now.\nBack in Sanji and Pudding's room, Sanji attempts to make conversation with Pudding, trying to act nervous about the upcoming affair. Pudding answers sweetly, making him lovestruck and causing him to struggle to remember her true nature. He asks if Pudding does not want to be kissed on the mouth, and Pudding says that she does, which causes him to get a nosebleed that makes him rocket around the room and stains his suit in blood. Pudding acts concerned, but is really extremely appalled and angered by Sanji's display of foolishness. Sanji is treated, and he and Pudding prepare to be brought out to the wedding venue, with Pudding gleefully anticipating her planned assassination. In the wedding venue, the Charlotte Family talks with the Vinsmoke Family about the imminent union between their two families, and Big Mom and Judge make a toast. Bege talks with Perospero, and they talk about preparing for the upcoming event. Inside Bege's body, everyone except Luffy is awake and ready to go as Sanji and Pudding arrive on a teacup carried by Zeus. Glitter and confetti floats through the air as the wedding guests celebrate, and Sanji acts very lovestruck, which causes Bege to think he is just acting well. With the bride and groom nearing the altar, the clock strikes 12 and the wedding has officially begun.",

Thirteen years ago, his benefactor Corazon was killed by Doflamingo and was not only a top executive of the Donquixote Family but was Doflamingo's brother.\nRobin's group reaches Viola and Doldo's location and plan their next move. Rebecca and Bartolomeo offer to give Law's handcuffs key to Luffy. Doldo is hesitant to trust pirates, but with Viola's and Leo's persuasion, believing the pirates are the only ones who can help them since the Government has allowed Doflamingo to do as he pleases, they believe the Straw Hats are the only ones who can save them. Meanwhile, Franky tries to destroy the factory but is interrupted by Senor Pink, and they engage in another battle.",
        "long_summary": "The fighters below notice that Pica's stone body has frozen, and take advantage of this to head for Doflamingo's castle, intent on his head. Luffy, Abdullah, and Jeet continue riding away from Pica, the latter two refusing to get off despite Luffy's demands. Suddenly, Law snaps out of his thought, admitting to Luffy that his plan had been a detour to crush Doflamingo, but that he, too, wanted to repay the Shichibukai after losing to him before. He then tells Luffy how Doflamingo took away the most important person to him 13 years ago. This person was Corazon, his benefactor and the former top executive of the Donquixote family, as well as Doflamingo's biological younger brother.\nPica's larger stone body remains still due to his confrontation with Roronoa Zoro, allowing the Colosseum group to push forward. The Donquixote Family subordinates attempt to hold them off, but to no avail. Dellinger, Machvise, Gladius, Baby 5, and Lao G watch on from the second level of the newly located Royal Palace, amused at the group's momentum. They are impressed, but still confident that they will not make it through Admiral Fujitora's forces. Baby 5 comments that the Straw Hat Pirates still managed to stop Pica.\nA map of Dressrosa is shown, showing the locations of: Zoro as he battles Pica; Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law as they reach the first level of the palace; the Colosseum group advancing towards the Marines; and Kyros fighting his way through individually. The Dressrosa citizens attempt to reason with Kyros to give himself up without a fight. They explain that they aren't interested in his bounty, but that their deaths are guaranteed if all of the bounties aren't collected. Kyros empathizes with their logic, but tells them that he too must accomplish something, charging at them. At the former Royal Plateau, Nico Robin's group reach King Riku and Viola from the Colosseum, along with Tank Lepanto. Bartolomeo is disappointed that Luffy is not there, while Leo and the Tontatta are confused by Pica's larger form and the new location of the Royal Palace. Rebecca points out that they still have pursuers, but Robin easily dispatches them by making the net she had created for climbing up the plateau disappear.\nViola finds the key to Law's handcuffs, and expresses her intent to free him. King Riku attempts to persuade her otherwise, because Law and Luffy are pirates, but she replies that is precisely why they are the ones who can truly help their country. She goes on to say that the World Government granting Donquixote Doflamingo a special status and protection as a pirate is precisely how their country ended up in this predicament, and therefore she has no interest in their definition of justice. She claims they only listen to the cries of the people when it is convenient for them, whereas the Straw Hats have acted from a place of sincerity. The Tontatta agree, and bring King Riku up-to-date on how Usopp was responsible for the lifting the curse of the Hobi Hobi no Mi. They tell him that they also support the Straw Hats wholeheartedly. Rebecca decides that she will get the key to Luffy, with Bartolomeo enthusiastically asking to come along as well so he can see Luffy again. Viola warns her niece of the danger, but Rebecca assures her that she will be fine. This prompts Leo and Kabu to also offer to accompany Rebecca for further support. Everyone agrees to meet up again at the Royal Plateau afterwards.\nFranky finally reaches to the factory, and prepares to fire his Radical Beam. However, before he can release it, Senor Pink emerges and attacks him, wishing to continue their previous fight.",

        "long_summary": "As the citizens of Dressrosa continue running from the shrinking Birdcage, Marines and pirates alike assist the handicapped. Some citizens notice with a shock that the buildings not being sliced up by the Birdcage are being pushed along with it, making them even more afraid. On the second level of the palace plateau, Baby 5 explains how shrinking the Birdcage was Doflamingo's way of preventing his evil actions from being told. Sai then orders the Corrida Colosseum gladiators who are still standing to rescue the fallen and take them out of the plateau, and Baby 5 inwardly squeals in pride at her future husband's leadership, which Chinjao notes as well. Meanwhile, Viola, Usopp, and Hack climb down the King's Plateau, and Viola notices that the center of the Birdcage is shifting toward Doflamingo's location, meaning even the King's Plateau will be sliced apart. This causes Usopp to become frightened and order Hack to climb down faster. Zoro, Kin'emon and Kanjuro reach the streets of Dressrosa, and Zoro begins running in a direction. When asked where he is going, Zoro reveals that they are going to stop the Birdcage, shocking the two samurai. On the Flower Field, Cavendish examines Law's former severed arm, which had been treated by Leo and Mansherry. Cavendish says that when he worked as a toy in the underground harbor shipping Underworld materials, he realized that it would not be enough to just defeat Doflamingo himself. He tells Law that defeating Doflamingo would cause ripples all over the world, and Law replies that that is what they were after.\nOn the palace rooftop, Luffy casts off his sandals and Doflamingo watches in interest as he activates Gear 4. Luffy coats his arm in Armament Haki and blows into it, inflating his muscles to massive proportions. The air moves into his torso and causes it to balloon, and Luffy's Haki takes the shape of tribal flames on his chest. With that, Gear 4: Boundman has been activated, and Luffy keeps bouncing on the ground. Doflamingo laughs at the absurdity of Luffy's new form, especially the constant bouncing. However, Luffy says that he used this form during his two-year training in order to put the animals into submission, as he remembers struggling to keep up with them with normal attacks. Doflamingo is still not impressed, but Luffy begins compressing his fist into his forearm and flies toward the Shichibukai at high speed. Doflamingo attempts to block Luffy's compressed punch that was named \"Kong Gun\" with his own Haki, but the punch sends him flying into the town far below.\nDoflamingo slides into a building at high speed, causing it to fall over. The citizens nearby turn to see what has happened, and Viola reveals to Usopp and Hack in shock that Luffy has taken on a new form and sent Doflamingo flying into the street. The citizens stare at the fallen Doflamingo in shock and fear, wondering what has happened to their king. Two Marines attempt confronting Doflamingo, but the Shichibukai's anger causes them to lose their footing as the citizens run away in fear. Doflamingo looks up at the palace, angered and amazed that he had been sent flying that far. Suddenly, he sees that Luffy is flying toward him by compressing his legs and jumping off the air. Doflamingo tries attacking Luffy, but his attack misses as Luffy appears behind Doflamingo and dropkicks him with \"Rhino Schneider\", sending him crashing through several buildings. The citizens stare in shock at Luffy, and get even more confused as they watch the pirate bounce uncontrollably through the streets. On the third level of the palace plateau, Bartolomeo screams in delight at Luffy's new mode, and tries to tell Kyros how big of a deal this is. However, Kyros smacks Bartolomeo out of the way because he was blocking his eyesight.\nDoflamingo ends up by the King's Plateau and struggles to comprehend Luffy's new form as he flies into the air. Luffy flies up to Doflamingo's location, and the two face off. Doflamingo attacks Luffy with several string attacks, but Luffy breaks them all as the two clash head-on. Doflamingo activates Armament Haki and exchanges blows with Luffy, but the pirate physically overwhelms Doflamingo and headbutts him a long distance away. As Doflamingo flies, Luffy tries hitting him with a long punch, but Doflamingo dodges it and appears behind Luffy. Doflamingo kicks the defenseless Luffy with a Armament Haki kick, but to his shock Luffy's body absorbs the blow despite also being covered in Haki. Luffy's body recoils from Doflamingo's kick and sends the Shichibukai flying back, and Luffy prepares another punch. Doflamingo dodges it again, but using his Python technique Luffy keeps changing the punch's direction. Doflamingo uses Overheat to stop Luffy, but Luffy's punch destroys it as it finally reaches Doflamingo and hits him in the face.",

Bill reveals to Desire that he used everyone in his Silver Pirate Alliance to give him wealth so that he could live the most luxurious life in the world, and questions whether she really intends to defeat him and if she really believes she is stronger than him. Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill. The Silver Pirate Alliance members attack Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire as Bill prepares to kill them all with a bazooka. However, Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to knock out the pirates and their battle boats, leaving Bill alone and shocked. Luffy sees where Bill is, and Bill fires a cannonball at him, but Luffy shatters it as he punches Bill into the underground mine.\nBill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.\nBartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island. At the coast, the Silver Pirate Alliance and the Sweet Pirates get everyone onto a large ship as they prepare to escape the island's destruction. The Sweet Pirates worry about Desire, but are forced to set sail. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Barto Club are worried about Luffy and Bartolomeo, but Zoro is confident that they are all right since Luffy's vivre card is fine. Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.\nLater in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles. Inside Gran Tesoro, Tanaka arrives and reports to the Monster of the New World, a man named Gild Tesoro. Tanaka reports that Bill sank along with Silver Mine, but Tesoro is fine as he already had his fun with Bill and now was time for the real entertainment to start.",

Pedro is surprised that a former Shichibukai is one of Big Mom's subordinates, and Brook notes that Jinbe's allegiance to Big Mom is why she protects Fish-Man Island. He tells Pedro that Jinbe is important to their crew, recalling their time in Fish-Man Island and how Jinbe agreed to join them after he took care of some business. Brook is surprised that Jinbe would do something like what was mentioned in the newspaper article. Pedro calls Brook to join him around the corner of the building, and they look in the window to see Pudding trying on wedding dresses. She tries to leave because she has other arrangements, but her attendants and Tamago keep her in as they show her possible dresses. Brook and Pedro are shocked to see her there, knowing she should be at the coast and wondering what the Pudding that Luffy saw really was. Brook then recognizes Tamago, and Pedro states that he knew the Baron. A Chess soldier then asks to speak to Tamago, and they go outside. They then go over the locations of the Sanji Retrieval Team, and Brook and Pedro quietly panic as they realize that the Big Mom Pirates have known their every move. The only team members whose locations they do not know are Brook and Pedro themselves, and Tamago states that he knows Pedro and knows what he will try to do. He tells the Chess Soldier to continue searching for Pekoms, as he wanted to bring his teammate back to Big Mom to plead for his forgiveness.\nMeanwhile, on the northwestern coast of Whole Cake Island, Capone Bege calms down his infant son Capone Pez by making a silly face before turning to the captive Pekoms, who is standing close to the edge of a cliff wrapped up in chains. As he stands along with his wife Charlotte Chiffon and the members of his crew, Bege remarks on how Pekoms' life is ending right as Pez's is beginning. He tells Pekoms that he gave him his chance, but Pekoms steadfastly brushes off Bege's words. Recalling Pekoms' display of weakness on Zou, Bege says that the lion mink is not cut out for this business as he points his gun at him. He remarks that this is a good place to get rid of someone, as below the cliff is an ocean full of hungry sharks. As Pez starts to cry again, Bege asks Pekoms if he has any last words, and Pekoms shouts at him to not underestimate Big Mom. Bege then shoots Pekoms as Pez bawls, sending the lion mink falling into the ocean, where the sharks quickly converge on him.\nIn the Seducing Woods, Luffy chases after Sanji, who fails to recognize his captain and is acting much like a monkey. After a while, Luffy catches the Sanji figure with a Gomu Gomu no Ami and ties him up, and it heavily resists captivity. Luffy prepares to bring the creature, whom he thinks is the real Sanji, back to the crew, only to suddenly see another duplicate of Sanji that is also acting like an animal standing in front of him.\nIn the Whole Cake Chateau, Caesar Clown stands in the throne room before Big Mom herself, and she inquires about the state of the experiments she commissioned him to do. A terrified Caesar claims that he vigilantly worked on his research, and Big Mom reveals that she has had him look for a method to achieve Gigantification so that all races of the world can be the same size as her and they can sit at a table together like family. Previously, Caesar had told her that he was almost done with the experiment but needed some more funds, and Big Mom inquires about any results he may have found. Caesar reflects internally that those were all lies, as the gigantification experiments he had performed on the children in Punk Hazard had resulted in the subjects' poisoning and impending death. With no way to succeed, Caesar had blown Big Mom's money on a life of hedonism, purchasing Girls' Ships to come to the island every night. He was confident that he could escape Big Mom's wrath as long as Doflamingo protected him, only to be shattered once he read the news of Doflamingo's defeat. In the present, he lies to Big Mom that his research was disrupted after Luffy and Law destroyed his laboratory, saying he could only achieve the results he needed there. However, Big Mom reveals that she had the Minister of Candy construct an exact replica of his lab on Whole Cake Island, and asks Caesar how long before he can achieve results. Caesar is then brought outside to his new lab, and he is met by the Minister of Candy and Big Mom's first son, Charlotte Perospero. Caesar is given two weeks to finish the gigantification serum, and if he fails, Perospero will turn him into candy and lick him. Perospero also has possession of Caesar's heart, which he uses to torture the scientist, and Caesar remembers how Sanji gave Vito his heart on the Big Mom Pirates' ship; he then starts despairing over his impending doom.\nBack in the Seducing Woods, an exhausted Luffy carries duplicates of Sanji and Pudding to the clearing where the buried man is. He throws the duplicates onto the pile of his allies, which all act like animals. There are multiple duplicates of some of his allies, and an extremely confused Luffy wonders in desperation what is going on.",

        "long_summary": "At his base, Franky finally recognizes Spandam's voice and Spandam is eager to see Franky at Enies Lobby to teach him a lesson. Spandam then slashes at a nearby lamp with his sword but the candle ends up burning him and he hangs up the Den Den Mushi. Kaku then has Blueno tie up Franky and Rob Lucci leads the other CP9 agents out. However, before they can go any further, Usopp suddenly speaks up and demands the agents to let Franky go. Lucci simply turns to Usopp with a defying stare and Usopp quickly apologizes much to Franky's disappointment. Kaku then remembers Usopp from the Straw Hat Pirates. Outside the Galley-La Company, the shipwrights are seen trying to put out the fire. Inside, Paulie and Iceburg are seen tied up and unconscious and Chopper is seen grabbing a nearby sword.\nAt the Sea Train station, two men are discussing about the Sea Train's departure before Aqua Laguna hits. One of the men notices that the people boarding the Sea Train are secret agents for the World Government. They continue talking about how they might know the undercover agents and how they are rich. One of the men says that the agents will board the Sea Train soon and will know their true identities. Back at the Galley-La Company, the people are still trying to put out the fire to little success. Suddenly, Chopper rushes out of the building with both Iceburg and Paulie on his back and puts them down gently. Chopper then notices Nami injured and attempts to help her but passes out. The people then tend to the aid of Iceburg and Paulie and then agree to help Chopper since he saved Iceburg and Paulie's lives.\nBack at Franky's base, Kaku has just easily defeated Usopp much to Franky's disappointment and embarrassment. Kaku then hears that even though Usopp has left the Straw Hats, he is still living his life as a pirate. Kaku then states that Usopp also has to go to Enies Lobby and orders Kalifa to tie him up. Kaku then turns his attention to the Going Merry upset that Usopp hasn't disposed of it yet. Usopp angrily tells Kaku to stay away but Kaku knocks the Going Merry off of the chain and onto the water. Kaku then says that even though it was a temporary disguise, they are still respected as shipwrights and he opens the doors leading to outside. Usopp says that it's his ship and he can do whatever he wants to it but Kaku pulls down on the lever which causes the Going Merry to move closer into the sea. Usopp attempts to stop him but Kalifa ties him up with her thorny rose and the Going Merry crashes into the sea badly damaged now. Usopp tearfully screams out Merry's name.\nBack at the Galley-La Company, the people continue to struggle to put out the fire with the building itself starting to fall into pieces. Suddenly, Iceburg starts to wake up much to the shock and excitement of the people. The people then notice Nami also starting to wake up but are confused on what to do with her. Iceburg is now seen standing and he asks the other people that he needs to speak with Nami alone. Iceburg and Nami are now seen sitting alone and the other people wonder what they could be talking about. However, they continue to focus on putting out the fire as the other foreman are still trapped inside. Iceburg then apologizes to Nami for falsely accusing her and the rest of the Straw Hats and promises to clear it up. Iceburg, however, wants to talk about Nico Robin and asks Nami that when they first came to Water 7 did Robin started acting strangely. Nami agrees saying Robin went into town and never came back and that the next morning, she was the prime suspect in Iceburg's attempted murder. She continues saying that as soon Sanji and Chopper saw her, Robin said it was goodbye and wouldn't return to the crew. Nami then says that she and the others broke into his mansion in hopes of finding out the truth and recalls Robin saying she did it to make her wish come true. Nami then wonders what wish will force Robin to give up her friends and Iceburg says that he may know the answer. Iceburg says it may have happened as soon Robin got separated from the rest of the crew and says there is a good reason she did what she did. Iceburg then tells Nami that he and Robin have the plans to revive an ancient weapon that has the means to destroy the world much to Nami's shock.\nIn a flashback, Iceburg, still held down, has just told Robin that the blueprints that the other CP9 agents just found are fake and says he will rather die than hand over the real blueprints. Iceburg says if Robin is still searching for the Poneglyphs, then he has to do everything to stop her. Robin says she is only studying the Poneglyphs to learn more of the history of the world and doesn't care about the ancient weapon. Iceburg yells at Robin to take responsibility briefly remembering telling Franky eight years ago that weapons are made to hurt people. Iceburg then says that if Robin is still doing this, then she is better off dying right there and now and mentions Ohara. Robin angrily responds to Iceburg saying he knows nothing of Ohara and continues saying he knows nothing how the World Government has warped her life. Iceburg wonders if Robin hates the World Government so much, then why is she helping them. Robin says it's to make her wish come true and lets go of Iceburg. Robin then tells Iceburg that as soon she came to Water 7, CP9 presented her with two conditions: The first being to pin his assassination on the Straw Hats and leave their crew and the second being to turn herself over to the World Government and follow their every word. Iceburg tells Robin that the World Government won't let her live and wonders why, for escaping them for over twenty years, help them now. Robin then says that the World Government gave CP9 permission to activate a Buster Call against the Straw Hats. Iceburg is confused on the term Buster Call and Robin explains it's an emergency action that summons five Vice Admirals and ten battleships to the same location. She says that no matter how strong you are, nobody is able to survive a Buster Call and says that Admiral Aokiji gave CP9 the right to make the call. She says that as soon she heard his name, she surrendered saying if she hadn't, she and the rest of the Straw Hats would have been annihilated. Robin says she cannot turn her back on the Straw Hats as they helped her out which is why she hasn't run away. Iceburg then wonders what Robin's wish is and Robins says excluding her, the rest of the Straw Hats will be able to leave safely. Iceburg says that as long she has that, she doesn't care what happens to the rest of the world and Robin confirms this. Iceburg then picks up the nearby pistol and prepares to shoot.\nThe flashback ends with Iceburg telling Nami he couldn't pull the trigger saying he couldn't criticize her. Nami suddenly falls to the ground and tells Iceburg that she is happy that Robin hasn't betrayed them. Nami is eager to tell the rest of the Straw Hats the news saying now that Robin needs saving, she and the rest of the crew will not give up. Nami attempts to roughly wake up Chopper much to the horror of the other people. Meanwhile, at the Train Station, Robin can be seen and an agent is eager to see Robin has finally turned herself in. Not to far away, Sanji can be seen and finally is able to locate Robin again.",

Giolla reveals that their goal is to capture Momonosuke and since the ship is deformed, the Straw Hat Pirates have no way of leaving Dressrosa.\nIn the Colosseum, Bellamy receives a second chance to earn Doflamingo's favor by assassinating Luffy. Ricky refuses to be treated with the injured but gives in when he meets Rebecca who he seems to remember as a child. Luffy is becoming a crowd favorite when he tamed Ucy and is riding the beast all around the ring. Unfortunately, they bump into Hajrudin, a giant from Elbaf who proceeds to crush Lucy as well as the Bull. Though Luffy is not harmed, his new friend is not as fortunate to avoid injury, and with anger, Luffy delivers a Haki infused punch on the giant's face, knocking him out of the tournament.",
        "long_summary": "Off the coast of Dressrosa on the Thousand Sunny, Nami, Brook, Chopper, and Momonosuke are inspecting what has happened inside of the ship. Suddenly, someone appears and uses a strange power to redesign the door shocking the others. The women walks out of the room and Nami askes who she is. Two men appear and they introduce her as Giolla of the Donquixote Family under Trebol's Army. Giolla then says she has an idea and uses her strange powers to redesign Nami, Brook, Chopper, and Momonosuke into odd-looking characters. The four are shocked at their appearances and Giolla laughs saying they are a piece of art. Nami demands Giolla to turn them back and Giolla says she will only if they hand over Momonosuke. Nami urges Momonosuke that they won't do that and Giolla, hearing Nami, flings another cloud of art at them. Fortunately, Nami opens the hatch to block the attack and she and the others escape after the smoke clears away. Giolla and the two men wonder where they went and Chopper sneaks by and opens the lower doors allowing Nami, Momonosuke, and Brook to escape.\nGiolla is angry that they managed to escape and Nami and the others taunt Giolla to chase after them. Brook comments to Nami on how to get the interior of the Thousand Sunny back to normal but Nami doesn't know but says they need to prevent it from getting more messed up. Chopper still hopes that Giolla will go after them but is surprised that she has turned in the opposite direction. Giolla suddenly calls out for more of her troops and they arrive on Donquixote Doflamingo's submarine. Giolla tells the troops to chase after the Straw Hat Pirates and get Momonosuke. Giolla then starts to get another vibe preparing to use another art attack and the Straw Hats urge Giolla to send the attack their way. Giolla, not falling for the trick, unleashes her powers onto the Thousand Sunny completely redesigning it. Giolla is pleased at her work while Nami, Brook, Chopper, and Momonosuke looked on horrified. Giolla then says that the Straw Hats will never leave Dressrosa and urges them to surrender.\nAt the Corrida Colosseum, Ricky does not want to be treated by the employee. The employee urges Rick to take off his helment but Ricky angrily rejects. Suddenly, Rebecca walks over to him and Ricky remember her from when she was younger. Rebecca tells Ricky that he needs to get treated and Ricky agrees. At a different location, Diamante is seen giving a note to Bellamy telling him to kill Luffy. Bellamy is reluctant to do so as he remembers that Luffy cheered for him during his match. Diamante tells Bellamy that if he does so, then he'll be promoted to an higher member of the Donquixote Family. Meanwhile, Bartolomeo can be seen walking with a suitcase and walks beside Cavendish who congradulates him on his win. Bartolomeo heard that Cavendish wanted to kill \"Lucy\" knowning it's Luffy in disguise and Cavendish, thinking that Bartolomeo also wants to kill Luffy, tells him not to get in his way. However, Bartolomeo says that his connection with Luffy is \"much deeper\".\nOn the stage, many competitors are seen battling it out in Block C. The announcer Gatz informs everyone that there is literally one Giant sticking out of the group. This giant is revealed to be Hajrudin who easily knocks away numerous of competitors without much effort. Hajrudin then announces he will wield the Mera Mera no Mi and will become the king of the Giants. Suddenly, a Fighting Bull known as Grim Reaper can be seen knocking away competitors and the rider is none other than Lucy (Luffy). Luffy quickly becomes popular with the crowd much to Cavendish's annoyance. However, Luffy and Ucy run into Hajrudin and the giant crushes them both with his giant fist. Hajrudin celebrates but Luffy gets up unharmed (due to his ability) and tends to his fallen bull friend. Angry, Luffy uses Gear 2 to boost his speed and hardens his arm with Armament Haki to punch Hajrdin and takes the giant down with one hit. The entire crowd looks on shocked on how Luffy easily took down a giant.",

        "long_summary": "Conis is seen riding a waver towards Angel Island. At Lovely Street, McKinley announces to the public that Conis, Pagaya and Gan Fall, their former God, are on the run and that any information related to their capture should be reported to him and the White Berets. The citizens are concerned that if the three are hiding nearby, then God's judgement may land on the citizens as well. Just then, a soldier reports to McKinley that Conis has appeared at the harbor. As Conis advances with her waver, the White Berets are shooting arrows towards her. McKinley wonders why Conis is acting like she wants to be captured and proceeds to order for her capture. As the White Berets prepare to stop her advance, Conis continues to approach them with full speed, asking them to get out of her way. She manages to run over McKinley and as she jumps off of the waver, the waver crashes into McKinley and against a building. Conis finds herself surrounded by worried citizens who are afraid that God's judgement will be cast upon her, and that they'll get caught in it.\nAt the Arc Maxim, Enel is laughing and mentions to Nami that Conis has caused a scene at Angel Island, to which Nami responds that she was supposed to be at the Going Merry. Nami asks Enel about his Mantra abilities, particularly on his ability to identify people. Enel explains that he is able to use his lightning powers to read radio waves within Skypeia and if he hears a conversation he doesn't like, he casts his judgement. Nami begins to worry again and wonders how she'll escape. Enel stares at her direction and she asks him if something's wrong. Enel stares away and wonders whose presence he is sensing and then mentions to Nami that it was nothing.\nBack at Angel Island, Conis is begging the crowd to hear her out, to which the citizens respond back to stay away from them. A soldier attempts to attack her but Conis aims her Burn Bazooka at him, threatening to shoot. She then tells the crowd to go to the edge of the clouds at Cloud End so they can escape by boats to the Blue Sea, as the island will be destroyed by Enel. The crowd remains skeptical and a child throws a tomato at her face. Conis drops her Burn Bazooka and McKinley wonders what she is about to do. Shocking the crowd, she yells out that she does not accept Enel as God. The crowd runs away and hides, as to not receive God's judgement.\nEventually, the crowd notices that nothing happened to her and she responds saying that there's no point to God casting judgement on her when the whole island will be eliminated. She tells them that this message is from a soldier who risked his life to tell Pagaya and her this information, before judgement was cast on her father and the soldier. The crowd remains uneasy, as the same child asks why a God that helps them would do such a thing. Conis again pleads them to go to Cloud End, but the citizens express concern on leaving their homeland and relocating in the unknown Blue Sea. She tells them this is better than getting killed and that for the past six years, they all should know what kind of man Enel is. The crowd remains uncertain, believing that the events she fears may not happen or that a miracle will save them.\nIn shock at the crowd's stubbornness, Conis shoots her Burn Bazooka into the clouds. She reminds them that Enel has the power to keep them in despair and that time is running out and that waiting for a miracle to happen won't save them. She concludes to them that lying low as victims is no longer safe and that they must take action now to leave the island, for they can no longer protect their lives by blaming someone later. The crowd is moved by this and many of them go to pack their things and head to Cloud End. Some members of the crowd remain, asking of the status of their family members that are part of the Divine Squad, to which she responds that she doesn't know. They ask what the Divine Squad is doing in the first place, and McKinley interrupts them saying the White Berets will figure it out and tells the crowd to go ahead and that the Divine Squad will catch up to them.\nThe crowd is convinced and leaves, and McKinley tells Conis that he can't let this island turn into Birka, a southeastern sky island that Enel was raised on that disappeared six years ago, implying Enel destroyed his home island before coming to Skypeia. McKinley reveals that prior to Enel's arrival, McKinley used to serve under Gan Fall's Divine Squad. McKinley formed the White Berets knowing that while it would appear to betray the Divine Squad, he would be able to protect the island by enforcing Enel's rule. The White Berets gave the island years of stability by ensuring that no one would anger God, but McKinley now admits it was all for nothing if the island is truly eliminated. Conis tells McKinley that he had the people's safety prioritized, and that is nothing to be ashamed of. Conis asks him to continue to protect the people so she can help the Straw Hats escape.\nLuffy and Aisa riding on Pierre are seen running towards the location of the Arc Maxim. Robin wakes up and realizes that she can't carry Zoro, Wyper, Chopper, Gan Fall and herself up the stalk to escape at once but that they still need to escape to the upper area. Enel realizes that the presence he senses is not one of the five that survived and wonders where this new presence was hiding. Enel jumps towards the edge of the Arc Maxim to see and hear Luffy screaming for him. Nami runs over to see a determined Luffy ready to fight back. As Enel and Luffy exchange words, Aisa and Pierre are hiding and witnessing their display and she worries for Luffy's safety. As Nami attempts to warn Luffy of Enel's powers, Enel stares at her which stops her from talking. Enel comments that he can hear Angel Island running about and that they must've realized what will happen to them. Luffy asks him what makes him God and Enel responds he'll know soon enough. Luffy runs up and stretches his arm to get onto a platform, to which Enel comments that Luffy is no ordinary human either, but only a Paramecia user.\nAs Enel charges El Thor, Luffy rushes towards him, but El Thor is fired. Nami and Aisa scream at the display. As the smoke clears out, a giant hole is seen in the walls, and Luffy looks at it questionably before returning his gaze to Enel. To Nami's surprise and to Enel's amazement, Luffy dodged the attack. Enel charges up 60 Million Volt Jamboule and fires it at Luffy, which catches him this time. The smoke clears again to show an unharmed Luffy. Enel zaps out of his space to appear directly in front of Luffy this time and uses 100 Million Volt Vaari. Nami then realizes that Enel's attacks are useless, as electric attacks don't affect the rubber properties of Luffy's body. Luffy yells out that he's had enough and after that final attack by Enel failed, shocked faces from Nami, Aisa, Pierre and finally Enel are revealed. Enel shakes his head thinking that physical attacks won't harm his body but as Luffy runs towards him, he successfully kicks and damages Enel. Nami now realizes that Enel's lightning effects can't protect him either, and that Luffy may be the only natural enemy to Enel.\n",

        "long_summary": "Luffy and Chopper gaze in awe at the town before them, which not only has a large variety of people walking around, but is also composed almost entirely of chocolate. On the Sunny, Nami and Carrot excitedly wear their new dresses, and Nami beats up Brook for peeking under her skirt. Pekoms tells them that it takes a day to get to Whole Cake Island from their current location, so he tells them to get groceries before they depart. Carrot notes that a large variety of races are gathered on the island, including minks. Pekoms then explains Big Mom's dream: a utopia where every race can coexist peacefully. He reveals that there are 34 islands surrounding Whole Cake Island ruled by ministers, which are all collectively known as Totto Land. The town they are in is Chocolat Town on Cacao Island, which is ruled by Minister Chocolate and is made entirely out of chocolate. Carrot asks if the chocolate can be eaten, and Pekoms affirms this, but reveals that it is illegal to consume the roofs because they protect residents against the precipitation the island gets. Pekoms tells them to come back quickly and that he will stay on the ship, but asks them to bring him back some chocolate. He then looks for Luffy so he can get into his disguise, but Carrot and Nami reveal he has already gone to explore the town, outraging Pekoms. Nami says to not worry, as they should find him easily, and her assertion is affirmed as a person cries out that someone has eaten a cafe.\nIn town, an angry policeman confronts the very rotund Luffy and Chopper for eating an entire cafe, but they reply that they had a good reason, which was that it was too good not to eat. The police officer angrily tells them that they are coming to the station with him, and Pedro prepares to free Luffy and Chopper by force despite Brook's pleas. Suddenly, someone comes flying down on a carpet telling the policeman to wait, and he recognizes the person as the proprietor of the cafe. A woman comes down and the policeman shows her what happened to her cafe, but she unexpectedly yells at Luffy and Chopper for not eating the entire building. She puts jam, biscuit, and chocolate in their mouths as she confirms the policeman's realization that they are actually dismantlers that she hired. The policeman warns Luffy and Chopper to put up a notice before they dismantle anything else, and apologizes for the chaos he caused. He then congratulates the owner, Charlotte Pudding, on her upcoming marriage, which makes her very happy. The Sanji Retrieval Team is bewildered by their unexpected savior, when suddenly a wolf mink approaches Pedro, asking what he was doing there. Pedro shuts his mouth, whispering that he was on vacation and telling him not to alert others of his arrival. Nami is surprised that Pedro knows people in this town, and Pedro says he will tell her later.\nLater, the Sanji Retrieval Team eats at another cafe, and Luffy thanks Pudding for bailing them out. Pudding, however, is thankful to him for declaring her cafe to be delicious, revealing that it was made from a recipe she created from scratch. Brook cries at Pudding's generous nature as Luffy shares his love of chocolate with her, but Nami says that they cannot stay long. Pudding understands, but asks if they want tea first to wash down the chocolate. As she makes the tea, Pudding asks the Sanji Retrieval Team what their names are, and Luffy tells her who he is despite Nami futilely attempting to cover his mouth, which makes her aghast.\nOn Whole Cake Island, Big Mom asks how long they have before the Tea Party, and two singers respond that they have three days. The two singers also confirm that Sanji has arrived, and people continue singing as Big Mom asks about the wedding cake and its ingredients. Her subordinates call in from different islands, having acquired ingredients for the cake by murdering the people guarding them. Big Mom and her entourage sing as they celebrate the upcoming ceremony, and Big Mom remarks that she has heard of Luffy's presence in her territory.",

Zambai and the rest of the Franky Family follow behind with their King Bulls, Sodom and Gomorrah. Zambai thanks Luffy for allowing them to come and fires the connection cannons that link their ship with Rocketman. Zoro yells at them for almost hitting him. Luffy asks Kokoro if Rocketman can go any faster and Kokoro says it will once they reach the railway. Kokoro then spots the railway and attempts to get the Sea Train onto them but it keeps moving away much to her annoyance. Suddenly, Chimney and Gonbe are seen on the front much to the shock of Kokoro who thought they stayed with Iceburg. Kokoro asks Luffy to get them but soon, Rocketman gets on the railway and it's speed increases dramatically. Luffy, Chimney, and Gonbe are sent flying away but fortunately, they fly into one of the larger members of the Franky Family.\nThe two Sea Train employees are watching as Rocketman finally reaches the railway and speeds off. They comment on Kokoro's experience on handling the Sea Train. They think they should inform Iceburg on the current situation. Elsewhere, Iceburg can be seen looking worried. Iceburg remembers how Kokoro told him that Franky survived being run over by a Sea Train so he will be alright. Iceburg remembers awhile back on how Kokoro is seen drinking and is saddened thinking that Franky had died. Kokoro tells Iceburg that she know he can doing being the first apprentice of Tom. Iceburg then tells Kokoro that they will share a drink someday and says that he will watch over Tom's dreams. Years later, Iceburg is informed by Kalifa that someone named \"Cutty Flam\" is here to see him. Iceburg looks very shocked but tells Kalifa to turn him away. Later that night, Iceburg meets up with Franky in a different location. Iceburg is surprised to see Franky's new body but Franky tells him that the Sea Train mangled up his old body so he had to make himself another. However, Franky is angry that Iceburg is building ships for the World Government after what they did to Tom years ago. Iceburg angrily tells Franky about who made the weapons that caused the incident in the first place. Iceburg continues saying he has never forgiven Franky even after Tom forgave him. A little while later, Iceburg is seen giving the blueprints to Pluton to Franky and tells him not to call himself \"Cutty Flam\" anymore knowing the World Government will be targeting him. He then tells Franky to leave Water 7 but Franky is worried about the World Government going after Iceburg. Iceburg, who has broken in tears, says he is glad that Franky is alive. Franky then yells out to Iceburg saying he won't leave Water 7 and Iceburg yells back at him saying it's to protect the blueprints.\nBack in the present and on the Sea Train that is heading for Enies Lobby, Franky can be seen climbing onto the top of it.  Franky wonders why he is thinking about Iceburg but is worried about Lucci telling him he's dead. In Rocketman, Luffy, Chimney, and Gonbe are brought inside after nearly dying. Zoro comments on the few extra people they got referring to Paulie, Peepley Lulu, and Tilestone. Paulie decided to come along saying the enemy that they are going after are the same ones that tried to kill Iceburg. Tilestone and Lulu agree to follow behind Paulie wanting to avenge Iceburg. Zambai speaks up saying that the enemy is also the one that kidnapped Franky. Lulu and Tilestone then tell Paulie to tell them who are the culprits on Iceburg's attempted assassination saying they won't be shocked on who they are. Paulie says that the culprits are Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa, and Blueno but, to his anger, Tilestone and Lulu are greatly surprised at this thinking the culprits were someone else. Luffy suddenly speaks up saying that even though they got into a fight with Galley-La Company and the Franky Family earlier, they all share a common enemy. Luffy says that the strongest of the group and Lucci and that he is going to be the one that fights him. Zoro says that it's a battle against those four. Nami notices the giant waves of Aqua Laguna coming but Luffy ignores this and offers to form an alliance. Paulie and Zambai agree to an alliance and Luffy says that for now, they fight as one and together, they will achieve their goal. Everyone cheers as Rocketman approaches a large wave.",

        "long_summary": "The Straw Hat Pirates are still fighting the Marines, while Luffy holds off Lucci, on the Bridge of Hesitation. Franky is shown firing into a crowd of Marines, which prompts one who is wearing boxing gloves to charge him. Franky easily dispatches him with raw power, throwing him back past the group he is fighting. The Marines are shocked at how strong the pirates are and how they are easily beating the captains of the ships they came from.\nAs Luffy and Lucci continue their fight, Nami and Nico Robin are shown out of breath and surrounded by Marines. One Marine notes that they should be fine as long as they can avoid Nami's lightning attacks. They then look up and realize there is another cloud above them. Robin has a hand come out of each Marine and slaps them. Nami then warns the Marines to be careful during the second thunderstorm, and unleashes another Thunderbolt Tempo on them, frying the whole group. Standing on the ship close by are Kokoro, Chimney and Gonbe who are seen cheering on Robin and Nami. Chopper is face-up on the deck of the ship, exhausted. Nami says they will leave Chopper's care in their hands before Robin and her take off up the stairs towards Roronoa Zoro, Franky, and Usopp. Chopper expresses his sadness over not being able to fight and wishes everyone good luck.\nAs Usopp watches Luffy battle Lucci, Marines approach him from behind. He turns and fires his Kabuto at them, but they easily dodge while jumping through the air towards him. Just as Usopp is about to be overrun a Rankyaku from Lucci flies up and takes out the three Marines that were about to attack Usopp. Usopp, who had his eyes closed, looks around to see all the Marines laid out, and promptly declares victory by starting to sing the Sogeking Song.\nFranky punches Captain Very Good, only to have him split into many smaller balls because he has eaten the Beri Beri no Mi, and begins making the balls hit Franky from every direction. Zoro steps in front of him and knocks all the attacking balls away. Franky then grabs onto Very Good's head and fires a Weapon's Left behind the head that sends it flying and crashing into the side of a battleship. Franky calls out to the Straw Hats to be careful, since some of these Marines have Devil Fruit powers. Nami and Robin arrive at the same location as Franky, Zoro, and Usopp with Marines in hot pursuit. Robin, answering Franky, says that she is also a Devil Fruit user, and turns around to face the Marines. She uses Clutch to bring down the group.\nZoro then looks over to see a Marine standing there wearing a mask. As Zoro goes to land a strike, the Marine catches his sword, which instantly rusts and turns to dust down to the hilt. The Marine tells Zoro that he is a rust-man who ate the Sabi Sabi no Mi, and that Zoro can not defeat him with swords because he will rust them all. Zoro picks up two Marine swords from the ground before charging to attack. He cuts the Marine, but the sword he used only disintegrates after being turned to rust. The Marine says again that Zoro can not defeat him with a sword, and grabs Zoro's arm and rusts his joints. The Marine begins to rust Zoro's entire body when Usopp launches a Fire Bird Star which hits the Marine and takes him out.\nMeanwhile, somewhere inside Enies Lobby, a Marine is shown talking on a Den Den Mushi to another Marine somewhere on the island. As the Marine drops the Den Den Mushi receiver and runs away, Sanji shows up and kicks in the door the guard was protecting. A large lever is revealed, as Sanji lights up a cigarette.\nUsopp is looking out with a worried face back towards where Luffy and Lucci are fighting. Usopp yells for Luffy to get up, who is on the ground bloodied and out of breath. Luffy manages to turn his head slightly, realizing that it is Usopp standing there and not Sogeking. Usopp then starts taunting Lucci saying that he has eight thousand followers and others lies that Lucci ignores. Usopp then taunts him, which finally grabs Lucci's attention.\nAs Lucci starts walking towards Usopp, Luffy tells him to leave Usopp alone and to stop. Lucci tells Luffy that he has no more business with him now that he is defeated, and to just watch from there as he kills all of them. Usopp eggs Lucci on again, telling him that he will send Lucci flying. Luffy tells Usopp to stop and asks if he is crazy because Lucci is going to kill him. Usopp then throws this back in Luffy's face, asking what he is going to do about it when Luffy is so close to death. Luffy struggles to get up, but only coughs up more blood and falls back down. Usopp tells Luffy to stop worrying him. Lucci reaches the edge of the destroyed tower, and asks Usopp if he is finished. To protect his friend from the menace of Lucci, Luffy gets up, ready to fight until he has beaten his opponent. The two of them charge at each other, each unleashing a barrage of punches.\nLuffy, about to fall backwards to the ground, remembers his promise not to fall until he beats Lucci. He stands up, arms outstretched, and lets out a blood-curdling yell. Lucci, who is bloodied and breathing heavily, turns his head to see Luffy standing there and is shocked. As he glares back at him, Luffy remembers all the times people claimed that Robin would be the Straw Hats' downfall, including comments from Admiral Aokiji and Lucci himself. Luffy lands a Jet Pistol on Lucci. Lucci flies at him, and he tries a couple more Jet Pistol's, but they miss. Lucci tries to use Rokuogan but Luffy moves away. Just then Lucci's tail grabs Luffy, holding him in place. Lucci uses The Largest Ring: Six King Gun point blank, which devastates Luffy. However, Luffy uses Jet Gatling. Lucci, seeing a huge attack coming, barely has time to use Tekkai and Lucci gets pummeled and slams into the wall. Luffy increases the power of the Jet Gatling even further hitting Lucci so much that he is projected through the wall. As the smoke clears over Tower 1, a Marine gets on the Den Den Mushi loud speaker and reports that Rob Lucci was defeated.",

Zoro separates from the group to fight the tiger.\nThe rest of the group later arrive at the ruins of Oden Castle. After seeing the graves of the Kouzuki Family, Luffy reunites with Kin'emon, Momonosuke, Sanji, Nami, Brook, Chopper, and Carrot. Once they are inside Oden Castle, Kin'emon reveals that he, Momonosuke, Kiku, Raizo, and Kanjuro came from the past.",
        "long_summary": "Heading to the ruins of Oden castle atop Komachiyo, Luffy grows restless and inquisitive after hearing Law, Kiku, and Zoro mention the existence of ghosts residing at the castle. The group notices that they are being chased by a shadowy beast, and Zoro volunteers to fend it off while the rest continue on. Zoro engages the creature, a giant white tiger wielding a sword in its mouth.\nIn the Flower Capital, the scene shifts to a school classroom in the middle of a lesson. The young students are learning about the strict isolationism of Wano Country, as well as the downfall of the Kouzuki Family. The teacher paints Oden and his samurai as foolish, treacherous men, while showcasing her strange ability to elongate her neck to her students. The children regard Shogun Orochi as a hero who brought peace to Wano. An eves-dropping old man is highly disturbed by the classroom's teachings.\nIn a different location, the city's money manager, Kyoshiro, is drinking with a friend as he shamelessly belittles Orochi for being a coward. Robin, who happens to be present preforming for the two, listens in. Kyoshiro muses about the supposed final words of Oden's wife uttered 20 years ago, before snoozing off mid-story. He then resumes, claiming that Oden's wife placed a curse on Orochi, that the nine samurai of the family will return in 20 years time to kill Orochi and restore the throne. Kyoshiro is driven to laughter, amused that Orochi seems to be frightened by the empty threats of dead men.\nLuffy and the others arrive at the castle ruins, as Zoro's battle in the woods rages on. Kiku isn't able to bare the sight of the destruction, and stays idly behind. As Law leads the way, he directs Luffy towards a cluster of nine distinct grave posts. As he inspects them closer, Luffy is taken back to see graves marked for Kin'emon and Momonosuke. He remembers how he wasn't able to contact the samurai while nearing the island, and Law confesses that he too hasn't heard from them in some time, but Luffy refuses to assume the worst has happened. Just then, a chilling presence begins lurking towards them. Luffy and Law steel themselves, before realizing who it is. It's Kin'emon, alive after all, who verifies that he's been having indigestion for days, and has been confined to the bathroom all the while. Relieved that Law was only miscommunicating, Luffy is glad to see Kinemon again, who is then suddenly embraced by Kiku, indicating that she and Kin'emon know each other well. Soon after, Momonosuke enters the scene. He excitedly reunites with Luffy, and informs him that Inuarashi has likewise made it to Wano.\nThe whereabouts of Nami, Chopper, Sanji, Brook, and Carrot are finally shown. After attempting to search for their captain, the group decided to make their way to the castle as per instruction. They've now arrived just in time to reassemble with Luffy and the samurai. They all cheerfully welcome each other back, and Law states that he was the bandit lifting food from Paradise Farm, disclosing that they should have a clean food supply.\nKin'emon invites Law and the Straw Hat Pirates to take shelter in the castle's remains. There, Kin'emon admits to his comrades that he has one last secret yet to tell them, but he fears it would be too unbelievable. Luffy implores Kin'emon to tell them everything, and Kin'emon proclaims that he, Kiku, Momonosuke, Kanjuro, and Raizo are not from this time period. In reality, they all came from 20 years in the past, and have come to present-day Wano to fulfill their commitment.",

On the way, she tells them Jack's invasion. 17 days ago, Jack led the Beasts Pirates in a raid on Kurau City in order to find Raizo the ninja. The minks claimed to not know Raizo, but the pirates attacked regardless, causing the minks to fight back.",
        "long_summary": "Law walks through the Whale Forest, and the members of his crew appear in front of him. They have a happy reunion, and go further into the forest to catch up.\nMeanwhile, Wanda takes the Straw Hats to see Duke Inuarashi through a passage in the Rightflank Fortress. The Straw Hats gaze in awe at the plants on the ceiling that provide light, and then realize that Luffy is missing. They find Luffy sitting on a tree outside the passageway eating grapes, and continue to be impressed by the beautiful scenery in the Rightflank Fortress. Wanda then reveals that the minks do not usually live in the fortress, but in Kurau City, which used to be intact and full of life. Minks of all shapes and sizes had friendly interactions with each other as they lived normal lives. However, the city was leveled just over two weeks ago, and Wanda prepares to tell the Straw Hats what happened. 17 days ago, the people of Kurau City heard a bell ringing, but soon realized that it was the Raid Bell, which they had rarely heard before. At the gate to the Mokomo Dukedom, Bariete frantically rang the Raid Bell as an unknown force pounded on the gate, and the nearby guards braced themselves for an attack. The invaders finally broke through, causing Bariete to fly into the rampart wall, and he got back up and continued ringing the bell as the invaders, consisting of several armed people and a massive quadrupedal object, raced toward Kurau City.\nThe invaders entered Kurau City, and the minks retreated as they gathered together in fear. The large object was revealed to be a mammoth, and one of the invaders, Sheepshead, revealed that they were the Beasts Pirates and the mammoth was Jack, one of the three Disasters who are Kaidou's right-hand men. The Beasts Pirates revealed that they were looking for a samurai from Wano Country, Raizo, but the minks claimed that they neither knew Raizo nor his location. Sheepshead berated Ginrummy for calling Raizo a samurai when he was a ninja, but Ginrummy replied that samurai could refer to anyone in Wano Country. Led by Monjii, the minks continued professing that they knew nothing, and offered to let Jack speak with the Duke in peace. However, Jack responded to this by destroying several buildings with his trunk, throwing the minks into chaos, and he refused such an offer as he ordered his soldiers called Pleasures to attack. One of the Pleasures targeted a frightened young mink, but the mink suddenly leaped toward him and struck him with an Electro attack. The rest of the minks followed his example as they blew the rest of the Pleasures away with Electro, and Monjii told Jack that the minks were all born warriors who would step up to defend their country in a heartbeat. Once again, he offered to have the Duke talk to Jack peacefully, but Jack refused any sort of talk as he ordered his Gifters, people with strange animal-like appearances, to attack.\nBack in the present, the Straw Hats are all shocked by the story, with Luffy being excited to hear about a mammoth and Brook quietly explaining that this is why he told them not to mention samurai or Wano Country. Luffy then sees that they are on a suspension bridge and rocks it for fun, scaring and infuriating his crewmates. As Wanda continues talking about the Beasts Pirates' search for Raizo, A crestfallen Luffy states that this probably means the ninja Kin'emon talked about was not here, which mortifies his crewmates as Wanda perks up her ears.",

Luffy then finally recognizes that man responsible for beating up Usopp and calls out to Franky wanting to fight.\nBack at the hospital, Kalifa informs the others of the Galley-La Company that Iceburg is now awake but still badly injured and can go into his room to see him. Paulie informs Iceburg that he and the rest of the company will watch over the shipyard until he recovers. Iceburg then immediately tells the others that he remembers who attacked him and says that one of them was with the Straw Hat Pirates indicating Nico Robin. Outside, the people are excited to hear that Iceburg is awake.\nBack at the shipyard, Franky taunts Luffy about attacking his gang and destroying his house. Nami only wants their money back but Franky says that he has already spent it. However, Luffy doesn't care about the money and wants revenge. The people suddenly start to move away as Franky suddenly starts taking in a large amount of air. Franky then suddenly lets out a large amount of fire that nearly hits Luffy, Nami, and the other Water 7 citizens. Nami assumes that Franky has Devil Fruit powers and Franky suddenly leaps into the water much to the confusion of Luffy and Nami. Franky then suddenly crashes into the boat sending Luffy and Nami into the air and Franky says that he hasn't ate a Devil Fruit. As Luffy falls toward Franky, Franky launches his Strong Right move right at Luffy sending him flying across the water, into the wall, and downward right on the top of his head. Franky moves onto shore as the other people run away and Nami wonders if Franky doesn't have Devil Fruit powers, then what is he. Franky then takes off his hand saying he's actually a human with robotic parts, also known as a cyborg.\nBack at the Galley-La Company, Paulie is confused and shocked to hear that one of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Kalifa confirms this and says that she had Lucci contact the government for more information. Hattori then says that Robin is a notorious criminal and is no surprise that she will do something so sadistic. Kaku then says that the next thing to do is to find the Straw Hats and Lulu wonders if they did this because they wouldn't fix their ship. However, Kaku sums up that the Straw Hats are responsible and must be dealt with. At a different location, Sanji and Tony Tony Chopper are sailing on a boat still looking for Robin. Chopper is still worried about the large wave that will sink Water 7 underwater but Sanji remembers that Chopper left something behind on the Merry. Sanji then turns around much to the excitement of Chopper.\nAt the Galley-La Company, Tilestone charges into the room loudly excited to hear that Iceburg is awake (much to the disdain of the others due to Tilestone's loud yelling). Annoyed, Paulie knocks Tilestone out of the room telling him to keep it down as Iceburg needs the silence to recover. Tilestone then apologizes and then tells Paulie that Luffy and Franky are fighting and destroying the entire shipyard in the process. Paulie is clearly angered by this and Hattori says that at least they know where to find him. Paulie then leads the other members of the Galley-La out to confront Luffy and Kalifa informs Iceburg that now he has peace and quiet. At the shipyard, Luffy and Franky continue to brawl as they wreck the shipyard as they fight. Luffy launches his Gomu Gomu Pistol which sends Franky flying backwards and Franky retaliates with a giant blast (Weapons Left). Luffy dodges the attack and attempts to counter back with a kick but Franky blocks it. Suddenly, both Franky and Luffy are suddenly punched backwards and it was revealed to be by Galley-La. The people are excited to see them and Luffy is just as confused to why they attacked him. Franky warns Galley-La not to interfere with his fight with Luffy but Galley-La simply ignores him and Paulie questions Luffy. Paulie then uses Rope Action on Luffy and slams him onto the ground (Rope Action: Haafu-Notto Ea Doribu). Franky yells out in frustration about Galley-La attacking Luffy, but the other Galley-La members prepare for a fight. Lulu then fires shots at Luffy who absorbs it due to his Devil Fruit powers and Lulu then roughly kicks Luffy onto the ground. Franky then starts to fire at Galley-La and Kaku falls down from above. Franky attempts to blast him but Tilestone knocks him away with a giant log. Kaku then grabs Franky and slams him onto the ground. Meanwhile, Luffy is in a fist fight with Lucci who eventually knocks him backward with his hand. Luffy still doesn't understand why Galley-La is attacking him and Paulie says that one of the members of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Back in the hospital room, Iceburg is remembering that one of the attackers was indeed Nico Robin and wonders if the masked man is also with the Straw Hats. He also wonders that they are after something important and, outside, the people heard that the Straw Hats are to blame for the attempted murder and are said to capture the Straw Hat Pirates.",

        "short_summary": "The human auction finally begins, and it is only then that the Straw Hats discovered that their mermaid friend is being sold off at Grove 1. After rendezvousing there (save for Zoro, Luffy, Brook, Usopp, and Robin), their initial plan to extract Camie is thwarted upon learning that the World Government and the Celestial Dragon are involved in the slave trade, so Nami decides that they'll buy Camie back in the auction itself. Meanwhile, the rest of the Archipelago receives news that the World Government is going to execute the captured Portgas D. Ace, a move that could provoke a war with Whitebeard.",
        "long_summary": "At the Marine Headquarters, a soldier reports to Vice Admiral Garp that Silvers Rayleigh is one of the slaves to be auction off at Sabaody Archipelago, making him burst into laughter. Garp says that he will handle the situation himself and orders him and his subordinate not to mention the matter to anyone else. Although the soldier is not very sure of the information, Garp is certain that it really is Rayleigh, and cautions against going up the Dark King unprepared. At the Human Auctioning House, Disco starts the auctions. The first slave is sold for 600 thousand belly. Disco seems to be in conspiracy with some of the bidders in the audience, jacking up the price. Sanji is shown the market price for the different type of slaves, which angers him. The rest of the Rosy Life Riders are still desperately searching for news concerning Camie. Usopp talks to the man who caught the giant slave and finds out that a mermaid has been brought to the auction house. They inform the rest that the kidnapper is Peterman and tells them about Camie's current location. With this, the riders head towards the auction house.\nZoro is surrounded by pirates with their swords drawn, wondering where is Grove 1. A pirate attempts to attack but is frightened by Zoro\u2019s glare, dropping his sword and pointing him in the right direction instead. Duval inquires about the information of the auction and reassures Sanji, saying that a mermaid would be the main attraction and Camie would definitely be saved for last. Sanji is frustrated at their speed but Duval claims that he has been heading for Grove 1 from the beginning and therefore, would be the first to arrive as he is their leader. However, Chopper arrives just before them and Sanji hits Duval. Franky arrives to see some of his crewmates demanding for the return of Camie from the staffs but they refuse. Franky wants to break her out and prepares to attack the house. However, he is stopped by Hatchan as there are Celestial Dragons inside. There is also the matter of the exploding collar that is on Camie. Chopper stops Sanji from attacking the staff while Nami resolves to get Camie back through their system. They enter the house and Heat brings their arrival to Eustass Kid\u2019s attention, who notes that Luffy is not present. The Straw Hat Pirates glare angrily as the auction proceeds. Nami calculates that they should have 200 million worth of treasure onboard and Hatchan says that it should be sufficient but he does not have the means to repay them. Nami states that to get their friend back, money is not an issue and the rest of the crew agrees.\nAround the island, newspapers are being distributed to the inhabitants, who are alarmed at the breaking news. X Drake informs his crew that Fire Fist Ace is about to be executed, shocking them all. He states that there is going to be a war, as Whitebeard would surely retaliate against the World Government. The remaining Straw Hats head towards the auction house, while Camie is approached by the staff of the auction house.",

        "short_summary": "The Straw Hat Pirates are ambushed by a group of bounty hunters led by Cidre out at sea. After escaping the attack, the Straw Hats go to an island with carbonated water. Luffy separates from his crew to explore the island. The bounty hunters attack him once again but Luffy also meets Boa Hancock again. They later go to the Cidre Guild's stronghold and encounter Cidre.",
        "long_summary": "Buena Festa contacts the bounty hunter Cidre to reveal to him that Douglas Bullet will be attending the upcoming Pirates Festival. Cidre looks forward to killing all the pirates in attendance, whose combined bounties are projected to total over 10,000,000,000, but is intent on taking down Bullet especially. Festa says that Bullet is not the only attraction, as Monkey D. Luffy has also been invited, but Cidre reveals that his guild is already working on taking down the Straw Hat Pirates.\nOut at sea, the Straw Hats are under attack by the Cidre Guild, who are flying on saucer-shaped vessels. Under the command of Ginger and Guarana, they blast the Thousand Sunny with carbonated water from special guns. The Straw Hats take down many of the members, but they are still overwhelmed, so they manage to escape using Coup de Burst. After landing, the crew recognizes that the Cidre Guild uses carbonation in their attacks like the Sunny does, and they immediately go to repair the damage on the Sunny. This leads them to find out that the ship's cola supply has run out, and they decide to get more as soon as possible in case the Cidre Guild attacks them again. Fortunately, they very soon reach an island, and Luffy volunteers to head out and buy a barrel of cola.\nLuffy ventures on the island to find it contains pools of carbonated water, and sits with his feet in a pool as he drinks a bottle of cola. After drinking it all, he runs into the ramune saleswoman Caramel, who reveals that he can only buy a whole barrel of carbonated drink from the island's factory. However, she warns that the island is under the control of the Cidre Guild. Luffy runs toward the factory, but is confronted by Ginger and his subordinates. Luffy battles them, but is hit by a powerful carbonated liquid attack, sending him falling into a sinkhole, where he is swept away by an underground river.\nElsewhere on the island, Boa Hancock is having a bath when Luffy suddenly emerges from one of the spouts. Hancock is very flustered and happy to see him again. However, Guarana reports to Cidre that Hancock and Luffy are together on the island, and Cidre decides to take the opportunity to take down both of them and blame Hancock's death on Luffy. Ginger then leads his forces to Hancock's bathing location, where they are attacked by Boa Sandersonia, Boa Marigold, and Elder Nyon. However, Ginger blasts through them and the wall, and they enter the bath. Luffy stands in front of Hancock to keep her Hoof of the Soaring Dragon hidden, but Hancock takes a stand as well and assists in attacking them. Nyon gives Hancock her clothes, and the group takes down all of Ginger's subordinates. Being the last one standing, Ginger unleashes carbon dioxide gas, forcing Luffy and Hancock to escape together while Sandersonia, Marigold, and Nyon are split up from them.\nGuarana reports to Cidre that Luffy and Hancock are heading toward the factory, and Cidre decides to go after them himself. Near the factory, Luffy apologizes for getting Hancock involved in the recent fight, but Hancock is happy to see him, thinking they would not reunite until the Pirates Festival. Luffy does not know what that is, and she reveals that it is an event that happens at random intervals where powerful pirates gather from all over the world. Luffy is intrigued by this, but Cidre then flies in and attacks, blowing a hole in the ground with a carbonation-powered punch. Luffy tells him he just wants cola, but Cidre says he will not sell any to pirates. He and his subordinates confront Luffy and Hancock, and he charges toward Luffy to acquire his 100th kill.",

Doflamingo tells them that he hates people looking down on him and reveals his family's past, of how his father made the family leave the life of luxury and how his mother died of illness because of their fallen status.

        "long_summary": "At the King's palace, Doflamingo is seen recovering from Luffy's Red Hawk to which he spits blood out. Law tells Luffy that all the damage they've managed to inflict are superficial wounds, stating that the strategy they used won't work a second time.\nIn Dressrosa Koala finds Sabo and sees if he's alright. Sabo says he is while Koala scolds him for not maintaining his position stating he should not be fighting an Admiral just because of his emotions. She says he could put the Revolutionary Army at war with them but Sabo retorts stating all that mattered to him was saving Luffy. Koala then violently pinches his cheeks and continues scolding him. Sabo then recalls his talk with Fujitora as the Admiral states that the Marines in this country cannot become heroes. When Sabo asks what others will think of his opinion and he states then he'll use the excuse of having been compromised. Sabo says that's a gamble, adding that he hopes the admiral has good luck. Back in the present, Sabo, who hasn't been paying attention to Koala continues to be pinched by her while she shouts that Hack and herself are always the ones that suffer in his place when people are annoyed by his selfishness.\nAt Usopp's location, the citizens begin to take Usopp and the others to Doflamingo's location to lure out the other criminals, when pirates show up and start killing off civilians to get the bounty on their heads. Despite the civilians trying to reason with them, the pirates continue killing them as Riku steps in and fights them. He releases Hack and Tank as they fight off the pirates and save the civilians. Seeing this, they all release Usopp and the others much to their confusion. They go on to state that by just manipulating Doldo for one night 10 years ago Doflamingo was able to turn the whole country against him and his bloodline. They state that after realizing the truth they just want to be saved from Doflamingo's cruel game. They go on stating that they were confused and don't know what to do, begging their former king to help them. The citizens then bow before Doldo stating if he wants them to fight they will do so. Doldo asks them to wait a little longer as he realizes he too is placing his faith in Luffy. At that moment, Fujitora shows up much to the surprise (and horror) of the Straw Hats. He states that he too will not allow Dressrosa to go to war. He then tells Doldo that he would be joining him in placing his bet on Luffy.\nBack at the plateau, Luffy continues fighting Doflamingo as Trebol tries to put himself together as he states he knows everything about Law's ability and that they originally wanted the Ope Ope no Mi for themselves. However, he can't reform himself like usual. Law reveals \"Radio Knife\" is something that creates a different incision than a normal amputation and that for a few minutes he won't be able to reattach his body. Law rushes at Trebol using a move called \"Injection Shot\" as Trebol tries to reason with Law stating he helped take care of him. Trebol uses \"Snot Sword\" but Law dodges and charges, but Doflamingo kicks Law's attack away. Doflamingo aims an attack as Trebol grabs Law's legs as Doflamingo uses \"Full Bright\" that pierces Law from above. Luffy notices this and tries to help but Doflamingo rushes over to kick him. Luffy hardens his arm with Busoshoku Haki but Doflamingo does the same to his leg and it overpowers Luffy. Doflamingo then uses his powers to tie Luffy's hands behind his back and has Bellamy slash Luffy with a sword.\nAs the duo lay incapacitated Doflamingo tells Law how he hates being looked down upon. He goes on calling them scum and that the fact that they actually thought they could defeat him was ludicrous, going on to reveal the sacred bloodline of his heritage as a World Noble. As Luffy and Bellamy react shocked by this revelation (Law already discovered beforehand back in Green Bit), Doflamingo states his father abandoned all of his former riches and privileges and took him and all his family to a garbage dump of a world. Labeling his father's wish to \"live like real humans\" as nonsense and foolish, Doflamingo ridicules his father and states how much he hated him. He then recalls himself as a child asking his father where the slaves are and wants to buy some. He then tells his father commoners refuse to bow to him, and that they are even hunting down the family. A scene of his mother dying is shown as the the rest of the family heard angry commoners shouting for the Celestial Dragon family. Back in the present Doflamingo states by the time he was 10 he saw the heaven and hell of the world and later killed him and took his head back to Mary Geoise to reclaim his heritage. However, the Celestial Dragons labeled them as a \"family of traitors\" and refused to accept him as one ever again. Doflamingo then swore he would destroy every part of the world they rule. He tells them the life they have lived is nothing compared to what he's gone through and that a grown man doesn't have time to play with them.",

Scared that he will lose his captain and friend, Usopp will attempt an impossible shot at Sugar from the plateau before the citizens stop him. With Viola's insight, he prepares to fire the special shot prepared with Kanjuro's help but at the last moment sees Luffy's aura and fires before the Dressrosa citizens catch him and everyone else with him. Viola watches as the shot successfully reaches Sugar, where it takes the shape of Usopp's face, which first defeated Sugar, scaring her again into unconsciousness. With the last obstacle gone, Luffy and Law finally reach Doflamingo himself.",
        "long_summary": "Kanjuro finishes his artwork and Usopp uses it as ammunition he dubs as \"Bagworm\". He is aided by Viola's ability to snipe at Sugar. Usopp replies that he has no other choice as he readies his Kabuto, and is ready to fulfill his role as the Straw Hat Pirates' sniper by providing support from afar. Kin'emon asks if there is any way they can help, and Riku tells Hack and Tank Lepanto to help him protect Usopp and himself from the bounty-seeking mob, who are getting closer and closer using Kanjuro's net, but also tells them not to hurt any of the people. Usopp prepares his shot with the help of Viola's powers, when the mob reaches the top of the plateau.\nThe mob prepares to capture Riku, Viola, Kin'emon, and Usopp and take them to Doflamingo, and Kin'emon offers his assistance against them. Right then, Sugar approaches Luffy and Law, and the former wonders who she is. She feigns innocence claiming she's lost as she tries to get closer to them. As Riku unsuccessfully tries to get the mob to stop, Viola guides Usopp towards Luffy, Law, and Sugar's location. The Kabuto aims for the lower part of the center palace window, and as Sugar draws closer and closer to Luffy and Law, Usopp takes aim, determined not to lose his captain. Not wanting to let Sugar get his way, Usopp prepares to fire his Great Black Kabuto, when suddenly he realizes with a shock that he can see Luffy, Law, and Sugar's auras. As the mob gets closer to him, Usopp finally fires his Bagworm Star.\nThe mob finally gets their hands on Usopp, but all he can think about is the shot's trajectory. Knowing there is a slight tailwind, Usopp put in two gunpowder boosters to help the shot go farther, and made sure that the outer wrappings would fall away so that his shot would definitely hit Sugar. However, he knew that even if it missed a little, it would still work as the shot was meant to induce trauma. This becomes clear when the shot is revealed to be a replica of the expression Usopp made that knocked out Sugar the first time. It works, and Sugar is once again scared into unconsciousness. This shocks the Donquixote Pirates and confuses Luffy and Law as Usopp's face projectile is absorbed into the wall and becomes a drawing, and it is revealed that the projectile was a drawing made by Kanjuro. With her defeat, the giant nutcrackers are turned human again. Back at the King's Plateau, Viola congratulates a tied-up and beaten Usopp, and it is revealed that the mob managed to tie up all their targets, but were sent into shock by Viola's arrival. Viola confirms that Law and Luffy have managed to reach Doflamingo.\nAt that moment, Luffy and Law stand face to face with Doflamingo and Trebol, with Bellamy unconscious on the ground. The Shichibukai asks them why they have come, and they both reply that they have come to beat him. Doflamingo appears to express disappointment at this.",

He says that CP9 and Robin will be there and continues saying thanks to Aqua Laguna, all of the rest of the Sea Train departures will be stopped. Nami is horrified to hear that especially since they have only half an hour to get to the Sea Train but wonders since Iceburg is the mayor of Water 7, that he can stop the Sea Train. Iceburg tells Robin that the Sea Train is bound for Enies Lobby and is currently being run by the World Government so he has no power over it. Nami concludes that they must make it to the Sea Train and informs Chopper about Luffy and Zoro's locations. Paulie suddenly gets up and tells the people to help out Nami and Chopper. The people disagree still thinking the Straw Hats are responsible for Iceburg's attempted murder but Paulie tells them that they aren't the culprits and should just give up on Lucci and Kaku. Paulie agrees to take Nami to the station and the people ready to get the Yagara Bulls. Iceburg secretly talks with Paulie saying he doesn't want to hurt the people about the truth.\nIn town, Nami, Chopper, and some people are seen riding on Yagaras. Nami will go to the Sea Train Station while Chopper looks for the other Straw Hat Pirates. Chopper and the other citizens continue to call out for the others even for Usopp. Paulie helps Nami show the way to the station while Nami keeps track on time. Nami tells the Yagara to go faster determined to save Robin. Back at the Sea Train Station, Robin is seen on the Sea Train while Franky and Usopp are thrown into the back. Franky threatens the guards and the guards proceed to beat him up (including Usopp). Sanji looks over the Blue Station but is frustrated to hear that the Sea Train will be departing at an earlier time. Back on the train, Kalifa says that after all the years, their mission is complete. However, Lucci angrily tells her not to talk nonsense as they aren't at Enies Lobby yet.\nNami is still trying to reach the Sea Train in time while Iceburg wishes for Franky's safety. The other people are still trying to find the other Straw Hat Pirates with Chopper leading the search party. Sanji wonders how the others are dealing with the situation but decides to board the Sea Train without them. Luffy is then seen stuck between some walls yet again trying to free himself. Zoro is now stuck in a chimney and is having similar problems. Back on the Sea Train, CP9 is informed on the Sea Train's early departure and Lucci says he has no feelings about leaving Water 7 after many years. Sanji is seen walking down the stairs while, nearby, Nami hears the whistle Paulie tells her that the Sea Train may be departing earlier than usual. Paulie knows it's because of the storm and that the World Government can leave whenever they want. The Sea Train is finally ready to depart and Robin remembers how Luffy rescued her and allow her to join his crew. Sanji closes in onto the Sea Train while Nami has finally just arrived. Nami heads down the stairs but is too late. Nami tearfully calls out to Robin as the Sea Train leaves out of sight.",

        "long_summary": "Nico Robin moves toward the palace with Usopp and Rebecca, while Sabo and Koala split to complete different tasks.\nAt Luffy's location, Law asks him if he knows what he is going to do and points out how their goal was to destroy the SMILE Factory in order to provoke a conflict between Donquixote Doflamingo and Kaidou. Law claims that Kaidou will turn his anger at losing his SMILEs to them if they kill Doflamingo now. Luffy states that this is not an issue now before demanding to know what will happen to Dressrosa if he stops now.\nMeanwhile the citizens of Dressrosa hunt for the people whom Doflamingo placed bounties on. As the Marines escort several captured citizens away from the rest of the soldiers, Bastille asks Issho if they should be trying to capture Doflamingo, only for Issho to order him to tell all units to restrain as many rampaging people as possible and focus on the Straw Hat Pirates-Law alliance.\nBack at the plateau, Luffy grabs Law and Zoro in either arm and states they will go, only for Law to remind him that he is still in seastone handcuffs. Viola states she will get the key, revealing that she saw it when they were falling. She states it must be somewhere on this plateau before stopping mid-sentence in surprise upon seeing Luffy running toward the edge of the plateau.\nAt the underground port, Koala boards one of the ships. She finds a chest filled with firearms and rips off a skull-and-crossbones sticker to reveal the seal of the Kingdom of Doerena. Koala takes a picture and, hearing voices, she hides as several men walk past while discussing what they will do if the Marines find out about their trade with Doflamingo. One of the men states that they just need to destroy the evidence along with the ship. Koala quickly defeats all of the men with ease.\nIn the city above, the citizens and Marines continue to attack each other against their will as Maynard asks Issho why they will not arrest Doflamingo despite his inability to maintain his status as a Shichibukai after this. Issho notes the Marines have been doing the same thing over and over and states Maynard has been a member for a long time before asking him if he has been listening to these cries of anger all this time. Issho demands to know if the World Government believes it is God, shocking Maynard, who falls back as Issho asks him to honor his decisions.\nMeanwhile, at the palace, Diamante notes that the Straw Hat Pirates and Law's target is the SMILE Factory, prompting Trebol to ask Doflamingo if they should not be protecting the factory right now. Doflamingo points out they can not open the doors because they are made of seastone. He then reveals he has the keys to the factory with him before cutting the keys to pieces, which shocks Baby 5 and Trebol. Trebol and Diamante apologize for failing in executing their duties and Doflamingo forgives them. Doflamingo then reveals that he already talked with Issho, and that the Marines will not pursue them, before stating that Issho will die once they are done using him.\nIn the city the Marines are ordered to restrain those who are still out of control as several of them learn of their orders to pursue the Straw Hat Pirates and Law. Watching the Marines run past him alongside Senor Pink and Dellinger, Machvise notes that the Marines are not antagonizing them. Senor Pink expresses disbelief at Franky having still had the energy to run away and wonders where he went. Elsewhere, Franky runs through the city with his shirt pulled over his head and notes that what he sees in the distance must be the SMILE Factory.\nLuffy and fall through the air and are noticed by Senor Pink's group. Luffy and Zoro begin running away from the assembled soldiers. Dellinger catches up to Luffy and disappears from sight before kicking at him, who manages to leap away in time. However, Senor Pink catches Luffy by surprise by swimming in the ground underneath him and grabbing his legs. Machvise appears in the air above them and uses 10-Ton Vise. Luffy manages to stretch himself far enough away for Machvise to miss his body, though his feet become pinned.\nDellinger tries again to hit them, only for Zoro to kick him in the back, causing Dellinger to stumble forward before accidentally kicking Machvise instead, which forces him off of Luffy's feet. As Zoro tells them to go, they are confronted by several warriors who intend to take their heads for Doflamingo's bounties. As they begin opening fire, Zoro rushes forward and effortlessly defeats those in his way while Luffy defeats the others with Gomu Gomu no Gatling. However they are interrupted by Issho, who claims that he who shoots often will not hit the mark as several Marines follow him.",

The two captains then learn how Kelly Funk betrayed them, only to be betrayed by Doflamingo in return. Luffy then decides to make his own shortcut by punching a hole in the roof and carrying Law, while leaving Ucy with the two bounty hunters.\nAt the SMILE Factory, the dwarves can help Franky in opening the doors, but first he has to deal with Senor Pink. Sabo is locked in a struggle with Issho. Doflamingo, still at the top of the palace, talks with Diamante and Trebol, reminiscing when they first met Law when he was a child, who wanted to join his crew to destroy everything in sight because he doesn't have much time to live.",
        "long_summary": "Donquixote Doflamingo confronts Monkey D. Luffy, Trafalgar Law, and Ucy, as they have fallen into a slanted well on the first level of the royal plateau. Angered by his presence, Luffy immediately attempts to punch Doflamingo but he blocks it effortlessly. After mocking them for getting caught into the trap, Doflamingo fires multiple string shots at the bull that incapacitates him and also knocks Luffy into the water. He mocks them further about how easily they were defeated, but in spite of this he commends Luffy for his ability to gather allies, especially under these circumstances. He wonders why Law would choose Luffy, and chides Law for being a coward. This upsets Law, who shouts that he will never be like Doflamingo, after having been \"saved\". As Doflamingo prepares to fire another bullet string, he is slashed and pierced from behind by Abdullah and Jeet.\nMeanwhile, Kyros is on the move and is taken aim by a bounty hunter. Luckily, an old man stops him and Kyros saves the old man. Though the civilian now holds the gun on Kyros, the latter convinces him to let him go and take down Doflamingo.\nBack at the tunnel the Doflamingo turns out to be a clone as well, but Abdullah and Jeet instead get Luffy, Law, and the Bull out of the water. After saving them, Jeet reveals that Kelly Funk betrayed them; however the clone Doflamingo showed up and slashed him down. Abdullah updates Law and Luffy that the Colosseum army has reached the 2nd level, meanwhile Kyros makes it to the first level. The Donquixote executives notice that none of the Colosseum Army has been halted by the Marines, and brace themselves for battle. Luffy punches through the ceiling of the well, creating his own passageway to the second level right in front of the Colosseum army. As Gladius berates the Donquixote subordinates for getting distracted, Chinjao takes advantage of the chaos in wake of Luffy's actions and presses toward the third level.\nBartolomeo, Nico Robin, and Rebecca continue marching forward and are shot at from below. Bartolomeo scares them away by taking his pants off and prepare to pee on them like at the Coliseum.\nAt the SMILE Factory location, Inhel and the other Tontatta have arrived. They announce to Franky that they have a plan for getting in, but require him to deal with Senor Pink first. He agrees to do so, while being slammed by Pink from behind. On the ground level, Sabo is still clashing intensely with Admiral Fujitora.\nIn the royal palace, Doflamingo comments that his clone was not able to accomplish its objective. He asks Diamante and Trebol if they remember the day they met Law. Diamante reflects on how crazy he was, while Doflamingo laments that he must kill him, as he remembers how Law used to resemble him. He recollects his first memory of a young Law: a young child has infiltrated his lair, with his entire body covered in explosives. He asks Doflamingo to let him join his crew, as he wants to destroy everything that he sees. He goes on to say that he was raised in the white city, and doesn't have much time to live.",

They later found out it was Foxy and Buggy.",
        "long_summary": "The episode starts with the narrator announcing the Spring has come, and some excited villagers, including Zoro, discussing the upcoming celebration of blooming of the sakura, which takes place once a year. Meanwhile, Chopper and Luffy are seen with Ninjin lying in bed feeling sick, and Chopper concludes he is too sick to move and better rest; Tamanegi and Piiman are disappointed with it, as they all wanted to visit the Hanami together.\nAll the Straw Hat Pirates are seen in their cafeteria, with Nami, Usopp and Sanji discussing the selling rate increase, and Luffy and Chopper feeling sorry for the fact Ninjin is sick and has to skip the festival. Luffy then states he would just like to find a way to show Ninjin the thousand-year sakura. Then both Luffy and Chopper leave, with Nami noting Luffy did not even finish his meal.\nThe day of the Hanami festival has finally arrived, and the people who gathered for its celebration note the sakura has been stolen. Usopp then remembers Luffy's words and starts suspecting him to be the thief. He then visits Nami and Sanji's cafeteria and shares his theory with them. This completely enrages Nami, and she orders Usopp and Sanji to find the thief immediately. They then proceed to look for Luffy (during this segment, Wanze is seen in the background showing the peace sign to the audience).\nUsopp and Sanji finally find Luffy in Ninjin's house, who's showing him a branch of sakura, which Usopp assumes is an evidence of Luffy's theft. He then starts interrogating Luffy, who denies all the accusations. Meanwhile, Robin spots the sakura tree on a pirate ship and quickly notifies the Straw Hats about it, who rush to the location.\nIt is then revealed that the theft of the sakura tree is a combined effort by Buggy and Foxy, and that they made an agreement that Buggy would steal the tree for Foxy for 10,000,000. However, Foxy then reveals he lied to Buggy, which prompts the latter to fire a Buggy Ball, only to be slowed down by Foxy's Noro Noro no Mi's ability. Luffy, Sanji and Usopp finally arrive to the ship and confront Buggy, who gets punched by Luffy while affected by the Noro Noro Beam, which confuses the Straw Hats, as they seem to be unaware of Foxy's powers. Foxy then uses the Noro Noro Beam to slow down both Sanji's and Usopp's attacks. Suddenly, Zoro appears, who is revealed to be sleeping all this time on the sakura tree. Foxy then attempts to use the beam on Zoro as well, but he instead parries it with his sword, reflecting it onto Buggy, who had just used the Bara Bara Festival, thus slowing him down. Zoro then punches Foxy, who immediately afterwards sustains Sanji's and Usopp's attacks, which he had previously slowed down. Luffy then delivers the exclamation point, punching Foxy with the Gomu Gomu no Pistol (while holding a sword in his hand), which sends Foxy flying. Sanji then spots Buggy, who is still under the effects of Noro Noro Beam, with Luffy punching away at him with a Gomu Gomu no Gatling Gun (while still holding a sword in his hand), which sends the separate body-parts of Buggy flying as well.\nThe Straw Hats then retrieve the sakura tree, carrying it on Foxy's ship, so all the villagers, including Ninjin, can witness it, which helps Ninjin recover almost immediately. Chopper starts wondering if the effects of his own medicine have finally taken effect, but then acknowledges that the sight of the sakura tree has cured Ninjin.",

Cracker taunts Luffy over this, and Luffy declares he will simply destroy the Biscuit Soldiers faster than Cracker can create them. Unleashing Double Culverin, he rapidly destroys the Biscuit Soldiers one by one in a continuous motion, but no matter how fast he goes, Cracker is at the ready with more Biscuit Soldiers. After this fails, Luffy decides to try taking out all the Soldiers in a single blow, so he flies into the air and blows into his arm, activating King Kong Gun. Cracker has his Soldiers form a tight defensive formation in front of him as Luffy unleashes his giant punch, and to Cracker's shock, the King Kong Gun blasts away his Soldiers like nothing as it moves quickly toward him. However, right before Luffy can land a hit on Cracker himself, Gear 4 runs out and Luffy is sent flying away as air spews out of his mouth. Luffy lands by a tree, and is angry with himself as he will be unable to attack for the next ten minutes.\nMeanwhile, the Vinsmoke Family looks on as Sanji holds the plate that Niji had thrown at Cosette. The food that was on the plate has fallen off, and Cosette tries to assure Sanji that she will clean it. However, Sanji examines the food, complimenting Cosette on its exquisite craftsmanship as he eats it, which both appalls and flusters her. The Vinsmokes are disgusted at Sanji's actions, but Sanji is just as disgusted with them, berating Niji for his despicable treatment of food and women. This enrages Niji, who tries to kick Sanji. Judge orders Niji to stop, and he stops his kick in midair, but the force of the stopped kick is still powerful enough to blow Cosette away. As Sanji helps her back up, Ichiji says that he does not comprehend Sanji's reasoning, saying that his behavior does not fit that of a royal at all. Judge agrees with Ichiji, and wonders if Sanji's bad behaviors were caused by Zeff as he pulls out a picture of the chef. Judge reveals that thanks to Big Mom, Germa 66 now has the exact location of the Baratie and can attack it anytime they choose, killing Zeff in the process. Tamago had given Judge the picture of Zeff along with the exploding handcuffs now on Sanji's wrists, giving him the tools he needs in order to keep Sanji in line. If Sanji acts out of line, the Baratie will be destroyed and Zeff will be killed, which stuns the young chef. Judge tells him that they will be meeting with Big Mom and Pudding for lunch today, so Sanji is expected to be on his best behavior, and he reflects as his sister and brothers walk out of the room.\nSanji remembers the past, where he attacked Zeff as a young child when the captain of the Cook Pirates attacked the Orbit. Zeff easily overwhelmed Sanji and kicked him into a faraway wall, but Sanji would not give up, biting Zeff's leg declaring his dream to reach the All Blue. Soon afterwards, the force of the storm around them grew, and Sanji was blown into the ocean. To his crew's shock, Zeff cursed the young child before breaking off the mast with a kick and floating on it towards Sanji. The storm passed, and Sanji and Zeff wound up on a rock in the middle of the ocean with no animals or plants. Zeff gave Sanji a bag with five days' worth of food in it and ordered him to go to the other side of the island to watch for ships. Sanji complained that Zeff's bag was significantly bigger than his, but Zeff replied that he needed to eat more since he was an adult. Sanji went to the other side of the island, and rationed his five days' worth of food to last 20 days.\nOn the 25th day, Sanji ate his last piece of bread, which had grown moldy. As he ate, he remembered his attitude on the Orbit, where he failed to understand why the chefs ate the passengers' leftovers, claiming they could just throw them out and eat the abundance of fresh food they had in stock. Sanji welled up in tears at the memory, and accidentally dropped his remaining bread into the ocean, making him distraught. On the 70th day, an emaciated Sanji decided to go to the other side of the island and see if Zeff had died. After climbing up the rock formation separating them, Sanji noticed with a shock that Zeff seemed to still have lots of food in his bag, and threatened Zeff at knifepoint for his food. Zeff did not resist as Sanji cut open the bag, but the young chef was shocked as he discovered that the bag only had treasure in it. Sanji wonders in shock what Zeff has been eating, and then sees that the lower half of Zeff's right leg is missing. Zeff revealed that his leg got stuck when he swam into a shipwreck to rescue Sanji, forcing him to slice it off with the anchor chain; he had not eaten at all since they washed up on the island. This drove Sanji to tears, and after the two of them were eventually rescued, they opened the Baratie together. Zeff was very rough on Sanji as the young chef dealt with cooking and women, but the two always had a bond, and when Sanji left the Baratie to join the Straw Hat Pirates two years before the present, he tearfully thanked Zeff for all the old chef had done for him.\nBack in the present, Luffy impatiently waits for ten minutes to pass so he can regain his Haki, complaining that it is taking forever. Meanwhile, Cracker creates multiple Biscuit Soldiers to hunt Luffy down, and one of the Soldiers eventually succeeds. It slams its giant Pretzel at Luffy, and Luffy barely manages to dodge, but is barely able to move as the Biscuit Soldier quickly catches up to him and prepares to make a decisive strike.",

They run past Luffy, who struggles to stay off the ground, and some stop by him, but run away due to not wanting to get involved with Doflamingo. Luffy falls to the ground once again, but is suddenly grabbed by Gatz, who recognizes him as the gladiator Lucy from Corrida Colosseum and asks Luffy if he remembers him. As Doflamingo causes more shockwaves in the palace plateau, Gatz asks if Luffy could continue his battle with Doflamingo, and the pirate replies that he needs ten minutes, as he could not use Armament Haki for ten minutes after using Gear 4. Doflamingo frees himself from the cliff face and gleefully looks at the fallen Luffy as he keeps repairing his internal organs, saying he had returned.\nGatz asks Luffy if he would free them from the Birdcage after ten minutes as Doflamingo descends to the streets. Luffy replies that if he could regain his Haki he would finish off Doflamingo in one blow, and Gatz calls a horde of gladiators toward him. These were the gladiators who went after the bounties Doflamingo put on Luffy and his allies instead of helping them, and Mummy, Meadows, and Rolling Logan apologize for being blinded by money. They promise to hold Doflamingo off while Luffy regained his Haki, and as Doflamingo reaches the ground, some of the gladiators confront him. While they do this, Gatz and the remaining gladiators prepare to run away from Doflamingo. As they run, however, Jesus Burgess bursts through a building and brandishes his dagger, eager to kill Luffy. Gatz and the gladiators are frightened by his arrival, when suddenly he is kicked away by Sabo.\nA short time earlier, Sabo was running toward Luffy, having known that his Haki was fading. In the present, Sabo holds his pipe to Burgess' neck as the gladiators recognize him. Sabo tells Burgess that he is in the Revolutionary Army and Luffy is his brother, and Burgess realizes that someone else said the same thing, which Sabo reveals to be Ace. Burgess gleefully remembers how Blackbeard defeated Ace on Banaro Island two years ago and started the Summit War. Sabo says that Ace made his own choices, but from now on he would be protecting Luffy. Amused, Burgess says that he has no business with Sabo or the Revolutionaries, as he sights Luffy but Sabo questions that statement as he lights the end of his finger on fire. Burgess realizes in shock that he was the one that ate the Mera Mera no Mi, and Sabo tells Luffy to go ahead and deal with Doflamingo while he takes care of Burgess. Luffy too realizes that Sabo ate the Mera Mera no Mi, and Sabo replies that he would not have let anyone else have it as the brothers smile at each other.\nGatz and the gladiators run off while Sabo confronts Burgess. Burgess swings his elbow at Sabo, the force of the blow toppling the building in front of him, but Sabo avoids the blow by turning into flames. Sabo hits Burgess twice, then combines his Devil Fruit and Ryusoken to send Burgess spinning far away while being roasted with flames. The gladiators are shocked that he did this to one of the Four Emperors' subordinates, and Sabo realizes that Burgess' goal was to hunt down Devil Fruit eaters as he heads toward Burgess. Meanwhile, Luffy tells a confused Gatz that Sabo took his place during the Colosseum finals. Gatz says that that was against the rules, but he was glad that the fruit ended up in their hands. Suddenly, an explosion occurs near Doflamingo's location, and Gatz looks back in shock as he sees Doflamingo massacring the gladiators with his awakened Devil Fruit abilities. Some gladiators stare in astonishment at Doflamingo, wondering how he could fight them this easily despite his injuries. Doflamingo replies that he did not need effort to deal with them and angrily tells Luffy to come out.",
