Episode 792,Mom's Assassin - Luffy and the Seducing Woods!,"June 11, 2017","Nami, Chopper, and Carrot run from the anthropomorphic rabbit Randolph as he relentlessly attacks them, and also encounter a very large and strange man who is buried in the ground up to his neck. Unbeknownst to the trio, everything in the Seducing Woods is alive and trying to trap and kill them.
Meanwhile, Sanji has arrived at his family's castle, where he reunites with Yonji. Yonji tries to berate his brother for trying to resist his arranged marriage, and the two's argument results in them attacking each other.
Back in the forest, the Sanji Retrieval Team reunites with Luffy as they attempt to run back to the shore. However, each time they run back to where they came from, they end up back in the same clearing. They then realize that everything is alive, and the Luffy with them is revealed to be the mirror duplicate he was fighting earlier. Mirrored Luffy returns to her true appearance: the eighth daughter of the Charlotte Family, Charlotte Brûlée. Brûlée captures Nami and prepares to slice up her and Carrot's faces with her fingernails.","As Nami, Chopper, and Carrot keep running through the Seducing Woods on Whole Cake Island, they suddenly run into an extremely large man who is buried up to neck. Shocked at the sight of him, they ask who was the one to bury him, but the man reveals that he buried himself. Chopper gets angry at his irrational behaviors, and Nami and Carrot try to run away to prevent Chopper from getting worked up over him. The man reveals that he saw a man run past him earlier, and will tell the trio about him if they get him apple juice from a nearby waterfall. Thinking it might have been Sanji, Nami agrees, but the trio are suddenly ambushed by an anthropomorphic rabbit named Randolph. Randolph rides in on a crane and swings his spear at the trio extremely quickly, but Carrot manages to hear him coming and helps her teammates dodge his attack.
The trio manages to leave Randolph behind, and they regroup as Nami states that they should return to Luffy. The matter of Sanji was still unresolved, but his unusual behavior when the team encountered him made it questionable whether he was actually real. The trio prepares to go back, but notices in shock that all Log Poses and clocks are going haywire in these woods. As they try running back the path they came from, the objects in the Seducing Woods all come to life and sing as they block off the path to the shore, excitedly planning to trap and kill the Sanji Retrieval Team. While the trio runs, Randolph charges at them again, and Carrot flips back and the two clash. Carrot states that the rabbit is not a mink, as evidenced by his inability to use Electro. Nami tells Carrot to stop fighting so they could get back to Luffy, and Carrot knocks out Randolph's crane with Electro to keep him from pursuing them. However, Randolph leaps into the air and spins his spear at the trio, hurling it with great velocity.
Meanwhile, Sanji walks down the halls of his family's castle and passes a spot in the wall with a dent in it. He recalls a time when he suffered severe bullying from his three brothers and was kicked into the wall, causing the dent, as he becomes angered at the thought of it. Yonji appears, asking Sanji if he's being nostalgic before expressing surprise at the fact the ""weak"" Sanji is still alive and now a pirate. Yonji tells Sanji to say something as the latter tells his younger brother to go away. Sanji retorts he has cut ties with his family and has nothing to say to them, as the angered Yonji tells Sanji he heard about Sanji's refusal to marry Pudding, and he demands for Sanji to abide their family's orders. In response, Sanji repeats his demand for Yonji to go away as the latter angrily dares him to make him before attacking, but Sanji evades the attack. Yonji uses his technology to attack as Sanji activates his Diable Jambe to clash with his brother, surprising the latter.
Back in the Seducing Woods, Nami, Chopper, and Carrot run from Randolph's spear and successfully dodges it as it strikes the buried man in the back of the head. The buried man cries out in shock, but the trio pay no mind to him as they use him as a landmark. They then reunited with Luffy after running through a field of lollipops, and Luffy is still fighting his mirrored clone. When they tell the two Luffys about their situation, one of them goes along with them while the other heads in the exact opposite direction. They come back to the destroyed donut bridge, and Nami gets excited at their progress as they leap over the part the Noble Croc ate. However, as they jump, Luffy suddenly blurts out that the person with the team is not him. However, the Luffy with the team covers his mouth before the team hears more, and they continue running. However, they somehow find themselves back in front of the buried man, much to their shock, and the buried man is confused at their shock as he states that he did not move.
The team tries to go back down the path they were on before, only to find themselves in front of the buried man once again. While trying to piece this together, Nami and the team suddenly notice some trees and flowers walking towards them. Having been spotted, the talking objects turn bashful and start singing, adding to the Sanji Retrieval Team's appallment as they see cakes, lollipops, and even parts of the ground start talking and moving. Nami realizes that there was no longer a path back to the ship, and Luffy's eyes glow as he states that Nami has become aware of what is going on around her, before putting his arm around her neck. The team is bewildered by Luffy's actions, and realize that this is not Luffy as he transforms back into her true form: the eighth daughter of the Charlotte Family, Charlotte Brûlée. Now holding Nami high above the ground, the very tall Brûlée is mistaken for a tree by Carrot, which angers her. Brûlée points to the large scar across her face, saying that it makes her jealous of Nami's and Carrot's pretty faces. In retribution, she plans to slice their faces up with her extremely sharp fingernails, and Nami screams.","Nami, Carrot, Tony Tony Chopper, Pound, Randolph, Sanji (real and illusion (flashback)), Vinsmoke Yonji, Vinsmoke Ichiji (young silhouette), Vinsmoke Niji (young silhouette), Monkey D.

Episode 793,A Seafaring Nation - Germa's King Judge,"June 18, 2017","The world's only seafaring nation, the Germa Kingdom sails into Whole Cake Island as Sanji wallows in its castle. There, he is approached by his father Vinsmoke Judge, who confronts him over his scuffle with Yonji, which resulted in Yonji's face getting bashed in. When Sanji gives him the cold shoulder, Judge challenges his estranged son to a duel. Sanji proves to unexpectedly be a match for his father, and as they fight he recalls being abused as a child by his brothers, which Judge did nothing to stop.
Meanwhile, Luffy is hunted down by the anthropomorphic flora of the Seducing Woods as he searches for his teammates alone.","Behind the Whole Cake Chateau on Whole Cake Island is Lake Aprico, an inlet from the sea which Big Mom's allies can dock in. There, several Germa 66 ships come in and connect with each other, forming the Germa Kingdom, the world's only seafaring kingdom whose territory is solely comprised of these ships. The kingdom is mostly populated by men and soldiers, who constantly train every chance they get, and Sanji sees many of the soldiers training as he looks on sullenly from the balcony of the main castle. Sanji looks behind him, only to sigh in exasperation as his sister Reiju still remains in the room. Reiju remarks that they are family, so he should be nicer to his sister, whom he hasn't seen in a while, but Sanji states that he cut all ties with his birth family long ago.
He points in disgust to a portrait on the wall that shows a man standing over the heads of four kings. However, Reiju is not bothered by it, saying it was the Conquest of Four Nations, where the Germa Kingdom vanquished four kings in the North Blue. The triumphant man, who was their father, seeks to assert control over the North Blue, which the Germa Kingdom ruled over in the distant past, and once slayed these kings in his quest. Reiju says there is nothing wrong with men battling for power, and it is what the Vinsmoke Family prides themselves on, telling her brother to enjoy the royal luxuries that their power grants them. Sanji only gets angrier, and right as this happens, his and Reiju's father, Vinsmoke Judge, comes in to see him. Judge greets his son for the first time in a long time, but Sanji refuses to consider him as his father. Judge inquires as to what Sanji did to Yonji, surprised at the act as he considered Yonji to be strong. Sanji only replied that he must have been stronger, and continued to blow Judge off, causing him to tell Sanji to meet him outside, where they would settle matters physically like men.
Meanwhile, Luffy runs through the Seducing Woods confused as he looks for his crewmates and wonders what the fake version of him really was. As he runs, the flora of the forest comes to life, and they wonder if they should take Luffy out themselves. They decide to do so, and sneak up behind Luffy as he keeps running through the woods.
Back in the Germa Kingdom, the residents race to the scene of Sanji's and Judge's upcoming battle as the two prepare to fight. Meanwhile, in Yonji's castle, Yonji's face is struck by a hammer as he recalls his encounter with Sanji. Their scuffle left a massive dent in his face, and Yonji's scientist says that a hammer will not work and that he will have to use a press machine. Yonji's face is then smashed from the left and right by giant beams, returning his face to normal. Yonji wonders how he lost to a failure like Sanji. Outside, Judge begins the battle by rushing at Sanji and jabbing at him with his spear, but Sanji dodges all of the attacks. Reiju and the citizens are impressed with his skills.
As he and Judge battle, Sanji continues to disown his family and tries to figure out ways to get out of their life even if he marries Pudding, but Judge says those will not work as he continues to claim Sanji as his son. Sanji angrily denies this as he remembers making a cake as a young child. When it was done, however, it was stolen by his brothers, and Sanji tried to chase them to get it back, but he was kicked into a wall by Yonji. He tried punching his oldest brother, but the punch had no effect, and his brother viciously beat him in response. The other brothers laughed, and as Judge and Reiju walked by, Sanji begged his father to stop the bullying. However, Judge was content to let it happen, viewing Sanji as weak and worthless, and Reiju only laughed. Thus, Sanji was left at his brothers' mercy, and was thrown into the wall again as Yonji charged him.
Back in the present, Sanji blocks a strike from Judge's spear with a Armament Haki-imbued leg, shocking Judge and the spectators, and Judge is surprised that former his weak son knows Haki. He then acquires a sword and throws it to Sanji, expecting him to take it since he was trained in swordsmanship. However, Sanji coldly refuses, saying his hands were only for cooking as tension between him and Judge continues to boil.","Sanji, Vinsmoke Reiju, Vinsmoke Judge, Monkey D. Luffy, Vinsmoke Yonji, Vinsmoke Ichiji (flashback), Vinsmoke Niji (flashback)",
Episode 794,A Battle Between Father and Son - Judge vs. Sanji!,"June 25, 2017","Sanji and Judge continue fighting, and Sanji is overwhelmed by Judge's high-tech weapons. Judge then sacrifices one of his soldiers to get the jump on Sanji, defeating him. Reiju treats Sanji's wounds, and Judge has explosive cuffs placed on his son, forcing him to go through with the wedding with his cooking ability on the line.
Meanwhile, Luffy continues racing through the Seducing Woods, and is attacked by the forest's anthropomorphic flora. He beats them all up, but suddenly finds his teammates, plus Sanji and Pudding, standing nearby. He chases after them, but none of them speak or acknowledge him. Meanwhile, Brook and Pedro reach Sweet City, and see a newspaper being handed out that has a picture of Jinbe on the front page.","Sanji reaffirms his intention of using his hands only to cook and not to fight. Reiju compliments her brother's strength, while Judge mocks this and says that Sanji providing cooking services is an embarrassment. Judge then activates rocket boosters on his shoes and flies upward, flipping over to look down at his son. The Germa 66 soldiers gaze in awe at their commander's demonstration of power, but Sanji says that aerial attacks are his specialty as he activates Diable Jambe. Judge readies his spear to strike as he flies down, but Sanji counters it with a Diable Jambe kick. However, Judge grabs Sanji's flaming leg and hurls him to the ground. He flies over his downed son, saying that war advances science as he kicks Sanji in the chin with an electricity-imbued foot, which he strengthens with his rocket boosters. The force of the kick blasts Sanji into a wall, and Judge says that this Germa is not the same as the one Sanji once knew. As he lies on the ground, Sanji recalls his childhood in the Germa Kingdom, remembering how Judge locked him in a dark cell with an iron mask on. Not willing to forgive his family just for being related to him by blood, Sanji gets back up and prepares to fight with nothing but animosity towards his father. Activating Diable Jambe, he charges at Judge, but Judge has a few soldiers form a barrier between him and Sanji. Sanji is caught off-guard by the soldiers suddenly blocking him, and slows his attack as he tells the soldiers to move. Judge, however, rams his spear through one of his soldiers and brings it close to Sanji. Sanji clashes with the spear tip, but Judge builds up electricity in the tip, causing a powerful blast that knocks Sanji far away. The soldiers cheer and Reiju walks back inside as the battle ends, with Judge victorious.
Meanwhile, Luffy continues running and calling out for his teammates in the Seducing Woods. The anthropomorphic flora of the forest then comes to life and confronts Luffy out in the open. Luffy is surprised by their sudden presence, and the flora sings about his impending doom as they converge on him. A tree attacks Luffy with its root, but Luffy immediately responds by knocking it to the ground. He tells the other flora to be quiet and leave him alone, but they attack him all at once, causing him to get angry.
Elsewhere, Brook and Pedro sail through a river to Sweet City. Once they reach the capital, they dock in a hidden spot and head for the Whole Cake Chateau on foot. As they walk, they remark on the liveliness and diversity of the city, and a courier suddenly shouts that there is breaking news. He holds a newspaper up to get people to read the new story, and Pedro goes ahead to see what it is. He is surprised as he looks at the front page of the paper to see a picture of Jinbe front and center on it.
Back in the Seducing Woods, Luffy continues running after beating up all the flora that attacked him. He then runs into the large buried man again, and the man begs him to remove the spear that Randolph threw into his head. Luffy obliges, and then asks the man if he has seen his teammates. The man tells Luffy about his craving for apple juice and offers to tell Luffy if he gets him some, much to Luffy's exasperation. However, Luffy suddenly sees Chopper standing behind him, but Chopper fails to speak or acknowledge Luffy as he runs away on all fours.
In the Germa Kingdom, Reiju tells Sanji about how impressed she is with his strength as she tends to his injuries, and a downtrodden Sanji hopes to just get through the tea party quickly and get out of this. Judge then comes into the room, and Sanji is repulsed by him, saying he is even worse than he was in the past and viewing him as a stranger. Judge reasserts that the two of them are father and son, and explains that the Germa soldiers are trained to sacrifice themselves for their commanders at a moment's notice. Sanji asks why Judge does not use them to achieve his dream of conquering the North Blue, and Judge replies that this arrangement with Big Mom will guarantee that the dream becomes a reality, and a marriage is necessary in order to seal the alliance. Judge reveals that he chose Sanji because he did not want to give one of his beloved sons to a madwoman like Big Mom, so he chased after the son he had gotten rid of. Judge states that he still does not truly view Sanji as a son, just a failure who will be of use to him as a sacrifice for this arrangement. Reiju then places golden cuffs on Sanji, and Judge reveals that these are programmed like the World Nobles' slave collars to go off should Sanji attempt to escape. These cuffs will blow off Sanji's hands if they explode, preventing him from using the parts he treasures so much. Judge reveals that Big Mom gave the cuffs to him and so has the keys, shocking Sanji, and Judge proclaims that Sanji will marry no matter what.
Back in the Seducing Woods, Luffy continues chasing Chopper, who wears a blank expression and continues to neither recognize nor speak to him. He then sees another Chopper standing behind him, and has no time to react before Nami, Carrot, Sanji, and Pudding peek at him from behind trees, leaving him extremely confused. The anthropomorphic flora around him laughs to themselves, saying that Brûlée is playing with him and that Luffy would wander lost in these woods until he died and even after that.
Back in the Germa Kingdom, Sanji stands on a balcony as he examines the explosive cuffs on his wrists. He remembers Zeff examining his hands when he was a child, after he had gotten into a fistfight. Zeff berated Sanji for this, punching him as he taught him that the hands are meant to be used for cooking, not to be put at risk in fights. In the present, Sanji wails in anger as his precious cooking tools are now under a threat that he cannot overcome.","Vinsmoke Judge, Sanji (real & illusions), Vinsmoke Reiju, Monkey D.

He then shoots Pekoms into shark-infested waters.
In the Whole Cake Chateau, Big Mom meets with Caesar Clown, as she seeks to find out the result of the gigantification research she hired him to perform. Caesar, knowing that it was impossible and having blown Big Mom's funds on hedonism, lies that Luffy and Law stalled his research when they destroyed his lab. However, Big Mom reveals that she had her son Charlotte Perospero make an identical lab out of candy, and gives Caesar two weeks to complete the research, threatening to have Perospero turn him into candy otherwise.
In the Seducing Woods, Luffy discovers duplicates of Sanji and Pudding that act like animals. He catches them and throws them in a pile, but to his great confusion keeps finding more and more duplicates of his crewmates.","In Sweet City, the citizens read in shock at the news of Jinbe withdrawing his request to leave the Big Mom Pirates, and they mock him for his cowardice. Pedro is surprised that a former Shichibukai is one of Big Mom's subordinates, and Brook notes that Jinbe's allegiance to Big Mom is why she protects Fish-Man Island. He tells Pedro that Jinbe is important to their crew, recalling their time in Fish-Man Island and how Jinbe agreed to join them after he took care of some business. Brook is surprised that Jinbe would do something like what was mentioned in the newspaper article. Pedro calls Brook to join him around the corner of the building, and they look in the window to see Pudding trying on wedding dresses. She tries to leave because she has other arrangements, but her attendants and Tamago keep her in as they show her possible dresses. Brook and Pedro are shocked to see her there, knowing she should be at the coast and wondering what the Pudding that Luffy saw really was. Brook then recognizes Tamago, and Pedro states that he knew the Baron. A Chess soldier then asks to speak to Tamago, and they go outside. They then go over the locations of the Sanji Retrieval Team, and Brook and Pedro quietly panic as they realize that the Big Mom Pirates have known their every move. The only team members whose locations they do not know are Brook and Pedro themselves, and Tamago states that he knows Pedro and knows what he will try to do. He tells the Chess Soldier to continue searching for Pekoms, as he wanted to bring his teammate back to Big Mom to plead for his forgiveness.
Meanwhile, on the northwestern coast of Whole Cake Island, Capone Bege calms down his infant son Capone Pez by making a silly face before turning to the captive Pekoms, who is standing close to the edge of a cliff wrapped up in chains. As he stands along with his wife Charlotte Chiffon and the members of his crew, Bege remarks on how Pekoms' life is ending right as Pez's is beginning. He tells Pekoms that he gave him his chance, but Pekoms steadfastly brushes off Bege's words. Recalling Pekoms' display of weakness on Zou, Bege says that the lion mink is not cut out for this business as he points his gun at him. He remarks that this is a good place to get rid of someone, as below the cliff is an ocean full of hungry sharks. As Pez starts to cry again, Bege asks Pekoms if he has any last words, and Pekoms shouts at him to not underestimate Big Mom. Bege then shoots Pekoms as Pez bawls, sending the lion mink falling into the ocean, where the sharks quickly converge on him.
In the Seducing Woods, Luffy chases after Sanji, who fails to recognize his captain and is acting much like a monkey. After a while, Luffy catches the Sanji figure with a Gomu Gomu no Ami and ties him up, and it heavily resists captivity. Luffy prepares to bring the creature, whom he thinks is the real Sanji, back to the crew, only to suddenly see another duplicate of Sanji that is also acting like an animal standing in front of him.
In the Whole Cake Chateau, Caesar Clown stands in the throne room before Big Mom herself, and she inquires about the state of the experiments she commissioned him to do. A terrified Caesar claims that he vigilantly worked on his research, and Big Mom reveals that she has had him look for a method to achieve Gigantification so that all races of the world can be the same size as her and they can sit at a table together like family. Previously, Caesar had told her that he was almost done with the experiment but needed some more funds, and Big Mom inquires about any results he may have found. Caesar reflects internally that those were all lies, as the gigantification experiments he had performed on the children in Punk Hazard had resulted in the subjects' poisoning and impending death. With no way to succeed, Caesar had blown Big Mom's money on a life of hedonism, purchasing Girls' Ships to come to the island every night. He was confident that he could escape Big Mom's wrath as long as Doflamingo protected him, only to be shattered once he read the news of Doflamingo's defeat. In the present, he lies to Big Mom that his research was disrupted after Luffy and Law destroyed his laboratory, saying he could only achieve the results he needed there. However, Big Mom reveals that she had the Minister of Candy construct an exact replica of his lab on Whole Cake Island, and asks Caesar how long before he can achieve results.

Episode 796,The Land of Souls - Mom's Fatal Ability!,"July 9, 2017","Luffy finds Nami in the pile of his crewmates' duplicates, and she reveals what happened between them and Charlotte Brûlée. Brûlée used the Mira Mira no Mi to trap Carrot in the Mirro-World, and the anthropomorphic flora ambushed Nami and Chopper, subduing the latter as Nami ran away.
In the present, Luffy and Nami confront the buried man over what he knows, and he reveals that all the flora and fauna are alive because of receiving soul fragments from Big Mom's Soru Soru no Mi ability; she takes a month's worth of lifespan from all Totto Land citizens as taxation and releases them into the wild. When inquired as to how he knows this, the man reveals that he was once one of Big Mom's husbands.
Meanwhile, Big Mom orders Charlotte Cracker, her tenth son and one of the Three Sweet Commanders in her crew to go and attack the Straw Hats, and he stomps through the Seducing Woods as he draws closer to Luffy, Nami, and Big Mom's ex-husband.","The citizens of Totto Land come to a cathedral, and inside they meet a dark blob-like being. The creature asks them ""Leave or Life?"", and all the citizens choose life, causing the creature to reach into their body and pull out a small glowing spectral ball, which it places into a basket.
In the Seducing Woods, a confused Luffy ponders over the pile of creatures that look like duplicates of his allies, who are all making animal sounds. He sees one of the Nami duplicates talking, only to find out that it is the real Nami as she berates and hits him. Nami examines the duplicates of their allies before turning to the buried man next to them, angrily stating that he had seen the entirety of their conflict with Brûlée without doing anything. She then reveals to Luffy what had happened while they were separated, as his mirror duplicate had turned out to be the eighth daughter of the Charlotte Family, Charlotte Brûlée. Brûlée held Nami in her grasp, but Nami managed to free herself by extending her Clima-Tact into Brûlée's stomach. Brûlée recoiled, and Carrot attacked her, but she blocked the mink's attack with a rippling corporeal mirror. This mirror reflected Carrot's attack back at herself, sending her flying back. Brûlée revealed that she could create mirrors with the power of the Mira Mira no Mi, and Carrot attacked again, only for Brûlée to make a larger mirror that sucked her inside. This left Carrot trapped on the other side of the mirror, and Brûlée closed it, cutting Carrot off from Nami and Chopper.
The flora of the forest came to life again, and Brûlée revealed that they, including Randolph, were stationed by Big Mom to play with and take down the Straw Hats in the Seducing Woods. Nami and Chopper found themselves surrounded and overwhelmed by dozens of enemy flora, and Chopper told Nami to run so not all three of them might be captured. He then activated Monster Point and fought the flora as Nami ran away, and Brûlée gazed in admiration at Chopper's unusual appearance, saying Big Mom would be happy to have him due to her love of strange creatures. Nami struggled to keep her footing as she ran away, and Chopper continued struggling against the flora and Randolph. Back in the present, Luffy wonders what happened to Carrot and Chopper, and Nami says she does not know as it all happened right on this spot, which is why she is asking the buried man. Luffy joins in the interrogation, and the man struggles to answer. Meanwhile, at the Whole Cake Chateau, Big Mom's anthropomorphic food affirms to her that Brûlée and the homies are taking care of the Straw Hats in the Seducing Woods, and she is approached by Charlotte Cracker, a hulking man who is her tenth son and one of her crew's Three Sweet Commanders. He strikes fear into the food, and Big Mom orders him to head to the Seducing Woods and bring pain on the Straw Hats that would make them wish for death, to which he happily complies.
Back in the Seducing Woods, the buried man only agrees to answer Luffy and Nami's questions if they bring him apple juice, and an annoyed Luffy agrees to do so after he answers them. He first asks Nami if she is strong, noting that unlike Luffy she does not look like it. He says that Chopper was strong, but was ultimately subdued by the anthropomorphic flora and fauna who would not be stopped. Nami states that she got them to stop attacking her, as did Luffy after he beat up enough of them. Luffy then asks how everything is alive in the first place, and the man reveals that the citizens of Totto Land give up their lifespans in exchange for living safely in Big Mom's territory. They give away a month of their lifespans every six months as a result of Big Mom's Soru Soru no Mi, which enables her to manipulate souls. She sends her Incarnations, which are the black blob creatures, to collect the soul fragments, and these are released into the wild. When they enter an inanimate object or even an animal like Randolph, the object gains sentience and becomes a homie. Only humans and corpses cannot become homies. Luffy asks if the animal duplicates of his allies are also homies, and the man states that it is actually Brûlée's power turning animals into reflections of people. Luffy gets mad at the man for not telling him after watching the whole time, and the man replies he did not want to get involved in anything. He eventually relents as Luffy pulls on his eyelids, revealing after a long hesitation that he was once one of Big Mom's husbands. Luffy and Nami stare at him in shock, and as this happens, Cracker marches through the Seducing Woods, causing the homies around him to cower in fear as he heads toward Luffy, Nami, and the buried man to attack them.","Pound, Sanji (illusions), Carrot (flashback (real) and illusion), Tony Tony Chopper (flashback (real) and illusion), Charlotte Pudding (illusion), Nami (real and illusion), Monkey D.

Cracker reveals to Pound that Big Mom gave permission to kill him, and Pound begs him to let him see his daughters Chiffon and Lola one last time. The mention of Lola's name shocks Nami, who recalls meeting her on Thriller Bark. She remembers getting a Vivre Card pointing to Lola's mother, and realizes that Lola's mother is Big Mom.
Randolph, Charlotte Brûlée, and the giant tree homie Kingbaum arrive to finish the job against the Straw Hats, and Brûlée reveals that she has Carrot and Chopper trapped in a mirror, which she shatters.

The Vivre Card emits the aura of Big Mom's powerful soul, rendering all of the homies unable to attack.","Charlotte Cracker walks through the Seducing Woods, and the homies around him wonder what he is doing here. Cracker confronts them, asking if he was not welcome, and the homies quickly shrink back in terror as they affirm their welcome. Cracker emits an aura of immense power, causing a small burst that takes out all the homies around him. In a nearby clearing, the buried man continues talking to Luffy and Nami about his past with Big Mom revealing that she cast him away after he sired two daughters with her. Now, the homies in the woods do not avoid him, but simply do not care about him. Right then, Cracker emerges behind him, to Luffy and Nami's shock, and he grabs the man by the ponytail as he pulls him out of the ground. The man eventually fully surfaces, shocking Luffy and Nami as it is revealed that his body is the same size as his head; the two Straw Hats had pictured him as a fully fledged giant. Cracker confronts the man about him spilling information, and the man begs him to at least let him see his daughter Chiffon one last time, as he heard she had gotten married. He pleads for Cracker to let him see Linlin, and notes that although his other daughter Lola ran away, he treasures both of his daughters dearly.
Nami is shocked to hear Lola's name, and recalls Pudding telling them in her cafe about one of her sisters running away. She then remembers meeting Lola on Thriller Bark while the latter was a zombie, having protected herself from Lola's attack by claiming to be a man. She offered to help Lola woo Absalom; later, after Lola had crashed her arranged marriage to Absalom and gotten injured, Nami revealed that she was not a man, but Lola had already known and the two made peace as friends. Nami then met the real Lola on the Thousand Sunny, and hugged her; after successfully retrieving all the stolen shadows including Lola's, Lola gave Nami a Vivre Card leading to her mother, as she had come from the New World and her mother was a very powerful pirate there. Drawing a conclusion from her memories and the buried man's statement, Nami realizes that Lola's mother must be Big Mom.
Suddenly, Randolph comes swooping in from the sky on his crane, attempting to ambush Luffy and Nami. However, Cracker shouts at him to stop, knocking him and his crane away. Cracker's shout causes him to emit an aura of power once again, which causes all the homies around him to wither away in fright. Cracker expresses anger with Randolph for the rabbit homie acting important and trying to interfere in his job, and Randolph claims that his crane wanted to do it, which the crane vehemently denies. Luffy and Nami gaze at Cracker as they try to gauge his strength, and Cracker reveals that Big Mom sent him to ensure the Straw Hats would be taken care of, as Luffy had beaten Doflamingo and she feared that Brûlée might have trouble. However, Brûlée comes in on a giant tree homie named Kingbaum to protest Cracker's statement, as the two state that no one has ever left the Seducing Woods alive on their watch. Cracker replies that Big Mom needed the Straw Hats to be dealt with quickly and decisively, as tomorrow at noon the Vinsmoke Family will be fully gathered on Whole Cake Island. Brûlée reveals that she knows and has already made progress in this goal as she creates a mirror. Luffy initially mistakes her for a tree branch, and in response, she turns the duplicates of his crewmates back into animals before showing Chopper and Carrot trapped within a mirror. Luffy is shocked by this, and Brûlée drops the mirror to the ground from atop Kingbaum's branch, shattering it. However, Chopper and Carrot are still fine, just trapped within the confines of the shattered mirror. Chopper then reveals a plan that he has devised to Luffy and Nami.
Cracker then gets cracking, and prepares to execute his stepfather first. The man begs him to let him see Linlin, but Cracker reveals that Big Mom approved of him executing her former husband. The man is shocked, saying he is Cracker's stepfather, but Cracker replies that Big Mom does not consider her 43 ex-husbands to be her real family, nor do any of her children. The man begs for the chance to give his two blood daughters his blessing, but Cracker ignores him as he swings his sword at him. However, Luffy blocks the sword strike with his foot, and immediately flips over and kicks Cracker's arm, forcing him to release the formerly buried man. Cracker is surprised by Luffy defending the man, and Luffy replies that he has taken to him after spending a lot of time around him. As Luffy stands unflinchingly before Cracker's tremendous power, the homies around them all run away in fear of their upcoming great clash. However, Brûlée calls them back to chase after Nami and her stepfather, and Nami and the man are forced to run away. As they are pursued, the man reveals after being asked that his name is Pound, and wonders about Nami's earlier reaction to the mention of Lola. Nami then pulls out the Vivre Card that Lola gave her and reveals that she got this from her. However, the card emits an aura that stops the homies, including Kingbaum and Randolph, dead in their tracks. A shocked Brûlée wonders why they have stopped the pursuit, and Kingbaum reveals that Big Mom's powerful soul is emanating from the card, shocking Nami as her suspicions about Lola being Big Mom's daughter are confirmed.","Charlotte Cracker, Nami (real & illusion), Tony Tony Chopper (real and illusion), Carrot (real and illusion), Sanji (illusion), Monkey D.

Episode 798,An Enemy With 800 Million — Luffy vs. Thousand Arms Cracker,"July 23, 2017","Cracker overpowers Luffy in battle, revealing that he can multiply his limbs and weapons just by tapping on his body. Meanwhile, Nami and Pound are confronted by Brûlée and Kingbaum, and Brûlée tells Nami that other members of the Worst Generation had invaded their territory before, only to be quickly dealt with without even meeting Big Mom. Urouge had managed to defeat one of their Sweet Commanders, but was later taken out by Cracker. Brûlée then attacks Nami and tries to drag her into the Mirro-World, but Pound gains the resolve to attack his stepdaughter, branding himself an enemy of the Big Mom Pirates. However, Nami hits Brûlée with a thunderbolt and sends her falling back into Mirro-World, and Luffy continues to fight Cracker with determination.","The homies run away from Cracker and Luffy in order to avoid getting in their crossfire, but they are hit by Cracker's powerful aura and wither away. Luffy makes the first move as he activates Gear 2 and rushes at Cracker, but Cracker easily blocks Luffy's attacks with his sword and shield. Cracker then attacks, and to Luffy's shock he finds that Cracker has suddenly gained extra limbs and swords. Cracker attacks Luffy with three of his swords, sending him flying into a tree homie close to Nami and Pound. Cracker approaches the trio now with four arms each holding a sword, shocking Nami. He reveals that he can add extra limbs and weapons to his body by tapping it, adding even more arms and creating more swords and shields, as well as creating more legs. Luffy attacks Cracker again, only to be blown back by Cracker's increased defenses, and Nami tells Luffy not to engage in combat, as their goal is to retrieve Sanji as quickly as possible. However, Luffy states that he can only ever go all out in combat, and Cracker laughs at Luffy. He then boasts in his one-of-a-kind sword Pretzel, and Nami points out that he is holding six swords, which angers Cracker as he charges at the two Straw Hats. Luffy activates Gear 3 and clashes with Cracker, but still has no luck breaking through his defenses. Cracker overwhelms Luffy as he rapidly jabs at him with his multiple swords, and eventually catches Luffy in the chest with a spinning thrust called Roll Pretzel, which breaks through Luffy's Armament Haki defense and sends him flying a great distance through the Seducing Woods. Cracker pursues Luffy, causing massive amounts of destruction in his wake, and Nami chases after the two. However, she and Pound are confronted by Brûlée and Kingbaum, who decide to take care of the two of them.
Nami steps back from the giant Kingbaum in fear, and Brûlée mocks the Straw Hats and the other members of the Worst Generation, revealing that Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, Capone Bege, and Urouge had all previously invaded Totto Land. Except for Bege, who had allied himself to the Big Mom Pirates, all of the Supernovas had been chased away without seeing or even hearing Big Mom herself. The only one who made an impact in his invasion was Urouge, who managed to defeat one of the Sweet Commanders back when there were four of them. However, a massive storm hit as Big Mom sent a large fleet after Urouge, with Cracker in command. Urouge fought Cracker, and was unable to penetrate his defenses, even when he expanded his muscles with his Devil Fruit power. Cracker was underwhelmed by Urouge, and used Roll Pretzel to defeat him. Now, Brûlée speculates that Urouge's body is lying around somewhere, and she creates a mirror before throwing it down by Nami's feet. She then disappears and reappears in the mirror, boasting in the power of the Four Emperors as she emerges and expands the mirror, grabbing Nami by the ankle. Brûlée drags Nami into the Mirro-World, and Nami screams. Pound is initially overtaken with fear, but when Nami calls to him for help, he eventually builds up resolve and attacks Brûlée. She dodges his punch, but releases Nami, and proclaims to her stepfather that he has made himself an enemy of Big Mom and her crew. However, Nami unleashes a weather egg to create a storm cloud and strike Brûlée with lightning, stunning the woman as she falls into the Mirro-World and her mirror disappears. Pound states that Brûlée will be back, and Nami apologizes for forcing his hand, but Pound sadly reflects that Big Mom already considers him an enemy due to authorizing Cracker to execute him. He then asks if Nami is friends with Lola, which she affirms, and Nami states that she now knows the Vivre Card Lola gave her points to Big Mom. As a result, it can also repel the homies, and Nami intends to use the card to its full extent.
Meanwhile, Cracker catches up to Luffy, who is back up and intent on continuing the fight. Cracker attacks with Roll Pretzel again, but Luffy dodges the strike and barrages Cracker with Gear 2 kicks. Cracker maintains his defense, but is pushed back a bit; however, he proclaims that Luffy's attacks have no effect on him as he charges at Luffy. The nearby homies run in fear as the two clash, and Cracker tells Luffy to give up, but Luffy refuses as he is intent on seeing Sanji.","Charlotte Cracker, Monkey D.

Episode 799,An All-Out Duel - Gear 4 vs. the Bisu Bisu Ability,"July 30, 2017","Despite his most valiant efforts, Luffy cannot overwhelm Cracker's defenses. Cracker pins Luffy down, and the Sweet Commander claims that Sanji, as a royal, should appreciate his upcoming wedding and that Luffy is doing him no favors by rescuing him. This enrages Luffy, causing him to activate Gear 4, and he finally lands a harmful blow on Cracker. Cracker is powerless before Gear 4's might, and his body seemingly shatters after another attack. However, Cracker's body is revealed to just be a puppet made of biscuit, and the real Cracker reveals himself to Luffy, showcasing the powers of the Bisu Bisu no Mi as he creates several of the biscuit puppets that Luffy had taken so long to bring down just one of.
Meanwhile, Brook and Pedro encounter some Biscuit Soldiers as well in Sweet City, but as homies, and Pedro plans to use them to get into the Whole Cake Chateau. In the Mirro-World, Chopper and Carrot struggle to move around with chain balls around their feet, but they try to look into one of the mirrors. Elsewhere in the Seducing Woods, Nami decides to use the power of her Vivre Card to force the homies to attack Cracker, much to their shock.","As night falls, Sanji continues staring out of his balcony, and he is approached by Reiju. Reiju tries to get him to go to sleep, but Sanji continues to treat her coldly. She reveals that Ichiji and Niji are returning tomorrow, and Sanji solemnly remembers his two older brothers along with Yonji bullying him. Reiju reminds him that tomorrow will be a busy day before she leaves, but Sanji stays where he is. He takes notice of a butterfly flying around, but the butterfly draws his attention toward his exploding handcuffs, angering him. However, Sanji tries to calm back down as he lights a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Luffy barrages Cracker with several Gear 3 attacks, but even the might of those cannot penetrate Cracker's defenses; the Sweet Commander easily spawns more shields and blocks all of them. Cracker jabs his swords at Luffy repeatedly before imbuing two of them with Armament Haki and spinning them, and Luffy blocks the drill-like jab with Haki-imbued legs. However, Cracker eventually manages to overpower Luffy, sending him flying in front of a house located in front of a giant mirror. As Cracker goes after Luffy, the homies around the house run away from the conflict; however, a flower homie reminds them of their duty to protect the Seducing Woods, causing the homies to go back and try to prevent Luffy from getting away from the house. Despite taking some injuries, Luffy charges back at Cracker and attacks him with multiple rapid punches; once again, this has no effect, and Luffy remarks that Cracker's Armament Haki is extremely tough. After blocking many attacks, Cracker rams his shields into Luffy and holds him down on the ground. The Sweet Commander mocks Luffy's goal to rescue Sanji, saying that Sanji is all set for a luxurious royal lifestyle after his marriage, as befits someone of his blood. Cracker says that if Luffy managed to reach Sanji, Sanji would simply reject his former captain to live as a royal of high status. This angers Luffy immensely, and the Straw Hat captain blows air into his arm to activate Gear 4. He successfully manages to repel Cracker's hold on him, and flies toward Cracker in a rage, finally drawing blood from the Sweet Commander as he breaks through Cracker's shields and hits his body with a single Kong Gun. Cracker is sent flying back, and is left sprawled out on the ground.
Meanwhile, Brook and Pedro get the Whole Cake Chateau in their sights as they infiltrate Sweet City, but they suddenly see homies with bodies very similar to Cracker's patrolling down the city. They hide from the sentries, and are horrified when one of them looks into their alley, but it does not see them as it instead picks up a piece of candy left on the ground. Brook wonders how they are going to get past the sentries' security, and Pedro has an idea to use the sentries to their benefit. Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot gaze at Brûlée's Mirro-World, a colorful and abstract world with mirrors everywhere. They try looking around, but struggle to move with heavy ball chains wrapped around their ankles. Chopper encourages Carrot to keep pressing on, and the two approach one of the mirrors to look into it. Back in the Seducing Woods, Nami reveals to Pound that she intends to use the Vivre Card Lola gave her to its fullest by putting all the Seducing Woods homies under her command and using them to attack Cracker. The homies are appalled by this statement and try resisting or escaping, but Nami easily subdues them with the power of Big Mom's soul inside the Vivre Card.
Meanwhile, Luffy immediately moves to attack the downed Cracker, and Cracker gets up in time to unleash a counterattack with Pretzel. However, after a brief head-on clash, Luffy's fist shatters Pretzel and hits Cracker again, this time with such force that it apparently completely shatters Cracker's body. However, while Luffy's arm is still outstretched, a man peeks out of Cracker's remains and swings his sword at Luffy's arm, drawing blood. Luffy pulls his arm back quickly in pain, and he wonders who attacked him; he is given a shock as the man reveals himself to be the real Cracker. Cracker reveals that his previous appearance was actually a puppet he created out of biscuit with the power of the Bisu Bisu no Mi, which he usually operates inside due to not liking pain. He inhabits his Biscuit Soldier puppet so much that he even fooled the World Government, as his bounty poster showcases his Biscuit Soldier's face. Cracker then creates biscuits out of thin air and uses his craftsmanship skills to form several Biscuit Soldiers, and he taunts Luffy about the effort it took for him to take down just one Biscuit Soldier, as now he is faced with several and Cracker can create an infinite amount of them.","Sanji, Vinsmoke Reiju, Vinsmoke Ichiji (fantasy), Vinsmoke Niji (fantasy), Vinsmoke Yonji (fantasy), Vinsmoke Judge (fantasy), Monkey D.

Episode 800,1 and 2 — Assemble! The Vinsmoke Family,"August 6, 2017","Luffy continues struggling against Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers; every time he destroys them, Cracker just makes more, and the Sweet Commander keeps Luffy on his toes with occasional onslaughts. However, Nami has put the homies under her command and forces them to attack Cracker against their will, Chopper and Carrot decide to exploit the Mirro-World and gain access to all the mirrors on Whole Cake Island, and Brook and Pedro hide inside a biscuit soldier homie that is going into the Whole Cake Chateau.
The next day, Sanji's older brothers Vinsmoke Ichiji and Niji return to the Germa Kingdom, and the three of them reunite. However, when the Vinsmoke Family eats a meal together, Sanji and Niji quickly get into a fight over Niji's treatment of his food and cooks.","Cracker mocks Luffy as the two of them continue battling, stating that Luffy is no match for him or anything else in the New World. Still in Gear 4, Luffy continues destroying Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers with various attacks, and eventually manages to destroy all of them at one point. However, his efforts are to no avail as Cracker easily makes more soldiers, and Cracker himself sometimes leaps into the fray to attack Luffy with Pretzel. If Luffy's attacks get near Cracker, the Sweet Commander manages to dodge all of them with his reflexes. As he is faced with more Biscuit Soldiers than ever before, Luffy unleashes rapid-fire Gear 4 punches in an attack known as Gomu Gomu no Kong Organ, but Cracker only has his Biscuit Soldiers maintain their formation in front of him. He then leaps over his creations right at Luffy, and rapidly jabs Pretzel at Luffy's head, which the Straw Hat only barely manages to dodge.
Meanwhile, the homies in the Seducing Woods continue running away from Luffy and Cracker's battle, being too afraid of the powerful clash to get close to it. However, they suddenly discover with a shock that Nami is standing inside Kingbaum's mouth, keeping their master at bay with Big Mom's Vivre Card. Nami orders the homies to attack Cracker, and they are appalled at her outrageous command, but find themselves helpless to resist the power of the Vivre Card she carries. Pound calls Nami a horrible person, but she just asks the homies whether they are more afraid of Cracker or Big Mom; the homies reply that they fear her more than the other two. Meanwhile, in the Mirro-World, Chopper and Carrot look around at the mirrors scattered within it, and realize that all of the mirrors connect to a mirror on Whole Cake Island. Chopper then gets an idea, and tells Carrot that she will have to call him ""big brother"" if she wants in on the plan; she takes it farther by calling him ""Choniki"", which surprises the reindeer. Chopper then reveals his plan to use their access to every part of Whole Cake Island to their advantage, and Carrot praises this idea, which Chopper appreciates greatly. Meanwhile, as night falls over Sweet City, Brook cuts open the back of a Biscuit Soldier homie on patrol, allowing him and Pedro to get inside its body. Pedro reveals that the soldiers will return to the Whole Cake Chateau when they are done patrolling, and the two decide to sneak in this way and make their move afterwards.
The next morning, Big Mom expresses her impatience that she has to wait another day to eat wedding cake at the tea party, though everything still seems to be going as planned with their efforts to eliminate the Straw Hat Pirates. Big Mom plans to meet with the Vinsmoke Family for lunch later that day, and knows that the chances of Sanji being rescued will be close to none once he enters the Whole Cake Chateau. She receives a report that the two eldest Vinsmoke sons have arrived, and in the Germa Kingdom, Vinsmoke Ichiji and Niji arrive to a hero's welcome as the Germa 66 soldiers cheer them on. Niji is annoyed that Sanji has not come out to greet them, but Ichiji calms him as Sanji watches them from a balcony shaking at the sight of them. The two brothers go inside to the throne room, where Judge commends them on their actions as Niji asks about Sanji as the latter and Reiju then come to the throne room. Niji approaches Sanji, expressing surprise that he was alive before congratulating him on his marriage and asks to speak as he takes notice of the exploding handcuffs on his younger brother's wrists and making fun of him for them. Sanji pushes Niji's hand away, causing the latter to get angry and the two brother tensely stare each other down. However, Judge breaks the tension by telling Ichiji and Niji to eat something.
Soon afterwards, all five Vinsmoke children sit around a table eating while Judge still sits on his throne, and they talk about the battle on Broc Coli Island that Ichiji and Niji ended. Judge points out that the Germa were hired after Doflamingo's weapons trade to the island had ended, and Reiju remarks that it was actually merciful for them to trounce one side and end the war early. However, Ichiji and Niji do not care about such ideals, only the money that comes from their services, and Yonji suggests being hired by both sides of a war to maximize their profits. However, Judge declines the idea on account of they would be more like pirates stating Germa Kingdom is still being a member nation of the World Government, although he expects to have their rights to go to Levely get revoked once they form an alliance with the Big Mom Pirates.
As Judge looks forward to the power he will get from this alliance, Niji makes fun of Sanji about his role in achieving Judge's dream and remarks on how he finally proved himself useful to the family. Niji calls out to Sanji who has just finished eating his food as the family conversed. The elder Vinsmoke continues his verbal abuse by stating he never thought he'd see the day that such a thing occurred as he and his brothers were surprised when he disappeared years ago and they all imagined the funny ways and places each of them could of died while out on his own. These remarks cause Yonji to burst out laughing while Sanji simply looks on unfazed by the insults.
In response, Sanji only tells his older brother to eat the food on his plate. Niji gets annoyed and claims that he is not hungry and the food tastes bad, and Sanji gets angry over Niji wasting food. Tensions boil up again, and Niji calls the head chef Cosette to the table to complain about the food. When she arrives, he throws his plate at her, but Sanji steps in and intercepts it. The food slips off the plate as Sanji holds it sideways, and he and Niji face off again, both brothers angrier than ever.","Monkey D.

Episode 801,The Benefactor's Life - Sanji and Owner Zeff,"August 13, 2017","Luffy cannot reach Cracker before Gear 4 runs out, and he is forced to hide in the Seducing Woods for ten minutes while Cracker sends Biscuit Soldiers to look for him.
Meanwhile, Sanji's argument against his family members is shut down when Judge reveals that with a single order, he can have the Baratie destroyed and Zeff killed. Sanji is deeply unnerved by this, as he remembers Zeff giving up his leg for him and acting as a real father figure to him.","Luffy grows tired as he continues destroying Cracker's endless numbers of Biscuit Soldiers. Cracker taunts Luffy over this, and Luffy declares he will simply destroy the Biscuit Soldiers faster than Cracker can create them. Unleashing Double Culverin, he rapidly destroys the Biscuit Soldiers one by one in a continuous motion, but no matter how fast he goes, Cracker is at the ready with more Biscuit Soldiers. After this fails, Luffy decides to try taking out all the Soldiers in a single blow, so he flies into the air and blows into his arm, activating King Kong Gun. Cracker has his Soldiers form a tight defensive formation in front of him as Luffy unleashes his giant punch, and to Cracker's shock, the King Kong Gun blasts away his Soldiers like nothing as it moves quickly toward him. However, right before Luffy can land a hit on Cracker himself, Gear 4 runs out and Luffy is sent flying away as air spews out of his mouth. Luffy lands by a tree, and is angry with himself as he will be unable to attack for the next ten minutes.
Meanwhile, the Vinsmoke Family looks on as Sanji holds the plate that Niji had thrown at Cosette. The food that was on the plate has fallen off, and Cosette tries to assure Sanji that she will clean it. However, Sanji examines the food, complimenting Cosette on its exquisite craftsmanship as he eats it, which both appalls and flusters her. The Vinsmokes are disgusted at Sanji's actions, but Sanji is just as disgusted with them, berating Niji for his despicable treatment of food and women. This enrages Niji, who tries to kick Sanji. Judge orders Niji to stop, and he stops his kick in midair, but the force of the stopped kick is still powerful enough to blow Cosette away. As Sanji helps her back up, Ichiji says that he does not comprehend Sanji's reasoning, saying that his behavior does not fit that of a royal at all. Judge agrees with Ichiji, and wonders if Sanji's bad behaviors were caused by Zeff as he pulls out a picture of the chef. Judge reveals that thanks to Big Mom, Germa 66 now has the exact location of the Baratie and can attack it anytime they choose, killing Zeff in the process. Tamago had given Judge the picture of Zeff along with the exploding handcuffs now on Sanji's wrists, giving him the tools he needs in order to keep Sanji in line. If Sanji acts out of line, the Baratie will be destroyed and Zeff will be killed, which stuns the young chef. Judge tells him that they will be meeting with Big Mom and Pudding for lunch today, so Sanji is expected to be on his best behavior, and he reflects as his sister and brothers walk out of the room.
Sanji remembers the past, where he attacked Zeff as a young child when the captain of the Cook Pirates attacked the Orbit. Zeff easily overwhelmed Sanji and kicked him into a faraway wall, but Sanji would not give up, biting Zeff's leg declaring his dream to reach the All Blue. Soon afterwards, the force of the storm around them grew, and Sanji was blown into the ocean. To his crew's shock, Zeff cursed the young child before breaking off the mast with a kick and floating on it towards Sanji. The storm passed, and Sanji and Zeff wound up on a rock in the middle of the ocean with no animals or plants. Zeff gave Sanji a bag with five days' worth of food in it and ordered him to go to the other side of the island to watch for ships. Sanji complained that Zeff's bag was significantly bigger than his, but Zeff replied that he needed to eat more since he was an adult. Sanji went to the other side of the island, and rationed his five days' worth of food to last 20 days.
On the 25th day, Sanji ate his last piece of bread, which had grown moldy. As he ate, he remembered his attitude on the Orbit, where he failed to understand why the chefs ate the passengers' leftovers, claiming they could just throw them out and eat the abundance of fresh food they had in stock. Sanji welled up in tears at the memory, and accidentally dropped his remaining bread into the ocean, making him distraught. On the 70th day, an emaciated Sanji decided to go to the other side of the island and see if Zeff had died. After climbing up the rock formation separating them, Sanji noticed with a shock that Zeff seemed to still have lots of food in his bag, and threatened Zeff at knifepoint for his food. Zeff did not resist as Sanji cut open the bag, but the young chef was shocked as he discovered that the bag only had treasure in it. Sanji wonders in shock what Zeff has been eating, and then sees that the lower half of Zeff's right leg is missing. Zeff revealed that his leg got stuck when he swam into a shipwreck to rescue Sanji, forcing him to slice it off with the anchor chain; he had not eaten at all since they washed up on the island. This drove Sanji to tears, and after the two of them were eventually rescued, they opened the Baratie together. Zeff was very rough on Sanji as the young chef dealt with cooking and women, but the two always had a bond, and when Sanji left the Baratie to join the Straw Hat Pirates two years before the present, he tearfully thanked Zeff for all the old chef had done for him.
Back in the present, Luffy impatiently waits for ten minutes to pass so he can regain his Haki, complaining that it is taking forever. Meanwhile, Cracker creates multiple Biscuit Soldiers to hunt Luffy down, and one of the Soldiers eventually succeeds. It slams its giant Pretzel at Luffy, and Luffy barely manages to dodge, but is barely able to move as the Biscuit Soldier quickly catches up to him and prepares to make a decisive strike.","Monkey D.

Meanwhile, in the Mirro-World, Chopper and Carrot find out Sanji's location by spying through mirrors, unaware that Brûlée is hunting them down.
In the Germa Kingdom, Niji beats up Cosette in retaliation for Sanji's actions, and Sanji becomes enraged when he finds Cosette. Yonji offers to take Sanji to Niji, and leads him to the kingdom's secret cloning facility, where he reveals that Germa 66's soldiers are bred through illegal cloning techniques that Judge worked on with Vegapunk. Sanji is appalled, but when Niji and Ichiji walk in, he wastes no time in kicking Niji in the face.","As one of Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers prepares to attack the weakened and exhausted Luffy, Kingbaum suddenly comes in and kicks the soldier away with a root, apologizing to it as Nami is having him attack against his will. Nami orders the other homies to bring Luffy inside Kingbaum's mouth, leaving them with no other choice due to holding the power of Big Mom's Vivre Card over them. As this happens, Cracker learns Luffy's location, and he heads there as he creates some more Biscuit Soldiers to back him up. Luffy is brought in to rest, and he reveals to Nami that he needs ten minutes to get his Haki back. The Biscuit Soldier then catches up to and chases after the Straw Hats, forcing Nami to have her homie entourage run away. However, she orders some of them to attack the soldier, under the impression that it is Cracker, and the homies are flabbergasted. They are forced to obey her command, but barely do anything before the soldier easily destroys them, and Kingbaum encourages Nami to give up out of futility, but she refuses. Kingbaum then runs into the end, and can do little other than gaze in fear as he and the other homies sense Cracker approaching them. Cracker's presence withers away all of the nearby homies, and he finally reaches the clearing where Kingbaum is. When he sees the tree homie carrying Nami, he expresses disbelief with him. Nami wonders who he is, and the homies reveal that this is Cracker's real body, to her shock. Kingbaum reveals that he is being forced to obey Nami against his will, but Cracker has none of it, and as his presence withers away all the other homies in the area, he takes Pretzel and slices off the top of Kingbaum, removing most of his foliage.
In the Mirro-World, Brûlée expresses her anger at Nami for subduing her with a lightning bolt as she prowls around while nursing her wounds. While intent on getting her revenge, she first decides to go after Chopper and Carrot, who are still trapped in here. Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot think they see Sanji from one of the mirrors, but find out that he has a completely different face, and frighten him as they call out from inside the mirror. They keep pressing on in their search for Sanji's location, but become frozen in fear when they see Big Mom herself on the opposite side of a mirror. Big Mom is very excited, and Eggplant Soldier and another guard note that part of it is because the Vinsmokes are coming from the Germa Kingdom to meet her for lunch. Having overheard this conversation, Chopper and Carrot look for mirrors to the Germa Kingdom.
In the Germa Kingdom, Cosette walks through the corridors, and keeps thinking of Sanji. However, she is suddenly approached by Niji, who gleefully readies his fist. Later, Sanji walks into the room, and drops his cigarette in shock as he sees Cosette's beaten body. He calls for doctors, and Yonji appears from around the corner, stating that Cosette deserved this for being treated higher than her status allows. He says that it was obviously Niji who did it, and offers to take Sanji to him; Sanji complies. Yonji takes Sanji down to the lowest levels, and opens a large door to a room that they were not allowed to go in as kids. The two enter the room, and Sanji gapes in shock as he sees identical Germa 66 soldiers in giant test tubes. Yonji reveals that this is where Germa's soldiers come from; they are the results of experiments performed by their father Judge and Dr. Vegapunk before they were born. The two scientists had unlocked the human Lineage Factor and used it to pioneer cloning research, but this activity was forbidden by the World Government, causing them to arrest Vegapunk and forcing Judge to continue performing the research in the secret. Now, it has borne them an army of strong clones who do not know their origins, never go against their masters, and will reach adulthood within five years. Sanji is utterly appalled by this inhumanity, and struggles to light a cigarette to calm himself down. As this happens, Ichiji and Niji come into the room, and they express their disappointment that Sanji's actions were not at the level they had hoped for. However, when he sees Niji, Sanji focuses entirely on his brother's actions towards Cosette and angrily kicks him in the face, appalling Ichiji and Yonji.","Monkey D.

Episode 803,The Past that He Let Go of - Vinsmoke Sanji,"August 27, 2017","Nami confronts Cracker and tries to use various tricks against him, but they prove ineffective and he overpowers her. However, Luffy regains his Haki and leaps back into the fray, taking Cracker by surprise with a Gear 2 punch.
In the Germa Kingdom, Sanji cannot continue fighting Niji due to the threat on Zeff, which allows Niji to pummel him. As his brothers stand over him, Sanji remembers his childhood in the Germa Kingdom. Judge had given him and his siblings superhuman abilities and had them train their skills, but Sanji continuously fell far behind his siblings' performances, causing him to be viciously bullied. Judge discovered that Sanji possessed no superhuman abilities after all, and he faked Sanji's death, locking his third son in a dungeon with an iron mask on to act like he never existed.","With Cracker facing off against them, Nami tells Kingbaum and the homies to run off while she battles the Sweet Commander. Kingbaum is shocked that she is going up against someone of Cracker's caliber, but Nami initiates her plan as she leaps out of the tree homie's mouth and strikes two Biscuit Soldiers with Thunderbreed Tempo. However, the soldiers are unfazed by the lightning strike, which only singed their biscuit bodies. They then attack Nami, overwhelming and subduing her. Cracker then confronts Nami personally, and asks her why she and Luffy are making the suicidal effort to get Sanji back. Nami replies that although Sanji can be annoying at times, he is one of her treasured crewmates and selflessly helps the crew in times of need, a relationship which Cracker does not seem to understand. Cracker ponders over Nami's words, and decides to attack her himself, believing that she will be unable to cause him pain. Nami manages to block the first few jabs of Pretzel, but Cracker eventually disarms her and holds Pretzel at her neck, saying he will take his time and kill her painfully. However, Luffy then bursts in with Gear 2 activated and punches Cracker, sending him tumbling away. Cracker is delighted to see Luffy again, and Luffy prepares to handle the Sweet Commander himself.
In the Germa Kingdom, Sanji has just kicked Niji square in the face, causing Niji to tumble into the wall. As Niji fixes his injured jaw, Ichiji reminds Sanji that they can have Zeff killed if Sanji keeps attacking, which causes Sanji to falter. Niji takes full advantage of this and quickly moves behind his brother, mocking him for his reaction to Cosette's beating as he rams an electrified knee into his back. Niji then sends Sanji sprawled out on the ground with an electrified punch, and he, Ichiji, and Yonji stand over their brother. They continue mocking Sanji's dedication to Cosette, and Ichiji reminds Sanji that he is still in the family's hierarchy as their failure. Sanji remembers his past in the Germa Kingdom, where he and his siblings stood before Judge. Judge told them that they had been endowed with superhuman abilities that would make them into powerful, emotionless military commanders, and said that they needed to train to awaken them. The siblings began to train, and as a test they jumped off a high balcony. Reiju, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji landed on their feet easily, but Sanji was caught in his fear of the large fall and failed to jump.
This trend continued, as Sanji would continuously fall behind his siblings in every physical test, even almost drowning once during a swim across the ocean. He and Niji once sparred with wooden swords, and to Sanji's surprise, his sword broke when he tried to strike Niji with it. Niji then responded by viciously beating Sanji with the sword, going for so long that the Germa 66 soldiers had to remove him from Sanji. Sanji's siblings started preying on his weakness and bullied him regularly, with Reiju seeming reluctant but still joining in. Judge was not pleased with Sanji's weakness, and was bewildered to hear a report from one of his aides that Sanji appeared to be a normal human with no superhuman modifications whatsoever. Sanji was in his room feeding a rat when Judge came in, confronting his son over his weakness. Judge grew angry when he saw Sanji feeding the rat, telling him to stop acting like his deceased mother as he sent the rat and the food falling out the window. Judge's brutality caused Sanji to cry, and Sanji's misery continued as his normal human body could not withstand the hard training. Accepting that Sanji was a failed experiment, Judge held a funeral for his son, claiming that he had died in an accident. Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji did not care about the news of their brother's death. In reality, Sanji was taken to a dungeon, where he was left with an iron mask on his head. Shocked and confused, he begged the soldiers to let him speak to Judge, but they revealed that Judge ordered this, as he wished to pretend that Sanji no longer existed. Left alone in the cell, Sanji wailed in agony at the abuse he suffered.","Nami, Kingbaum, Charlotte Cracker, Monkey D.

His father discovers him outside of his cell but allows him to leave. Sanji goes to the Orbit, leaving the Germa Kingdom behind.","Ichiji, Niji, Yonji, and Reijiu continues their training by combat against Germa 66 soliders. A scientist along with Vinsmoke Judge says that they are developing very fast, describing them as real superhumans. As the Vinsmoke siblings took down the appointed soldiers for training, Judge called them and congratulated them for doing well.
Meanwhile, Sanji has been imprisoned by six months. The cooks there have been wondering since they were making fancy meals every day, but had no idea where it goes to and was reprimanded by an old cook not to be nosy about it.
A Germa guard delivered food to Sanji and loosens his iron mask for him to be able to eat. As he was eating, a rat came and seems to be hungry and Sanji offers him a portion of a beef steak. The rat expresses excitement as it eats but then Sanji remembers his father scolding him about a royalty mustn't serve anyone and not to follow her mother's legacy as she is dead.
Sanji recalls when he was in the kitchen and got his fingers cut and spill a bit of blood. The old cook there asks him if he was alright and says to him that they were told by the King not to allow him go to to the kitchen. Sanji begs the old cook to let him stay.
As he finishes organizing the food, he went outside even with the rainy weather. As he was walking, a Germa guard ask him that why is he going by himself, and answers him that he'll go see his mom. However, the Germa guard replies that the weather is bad and the medical ward is too far, but Sanji in return says that he can make it. Just when Sanji continued walking, he noted that to don't tell it to his father as he slips because of the slippery floor.
In the middle of his walk through the medical ward, a dog blocks his way and seems to aim for the Sanji's food. He manages to drive it away and makes it to the medical ward as she was seen by a maid through the window. Sanji paused the maid goes out and brings him in.
There, Sanji presented the food to the maid and seems to be already too damaged because of the incidents earlier. The maid says that they don't want to let the queen have stomach trouble. Even so, the maid halfheartedly says that maybe it tastes good and gives it an attempt, only to shriek in disgust.
Sanji came into his mother's room along with the maid delivering food, saying that it's from Sanji. Sanji's mother asks him if he made it for her and agrees but with his fingers fidgeting. The queen exclaims at Eponi, saying not to be presumptuous and bring what Sanji really made for her. Eponi replies that she already threw it into a trash can because it was damaged on his way to the medical ward but the queen retorts as it was obviously a lie. The maid delivers it and Sanji apologizes to his mother saying that he tripped on his way and got it wet in the rain. His mother gives it a try and says it was good. She asks if he can cook again for her and Sanji agrees in joy. However, she passed away.
Back in his cell, Sanji requested a cookbook and some cooking utensils, and while he practiced cooking, he read something in his book about the All Blue. Later, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji discovered Sanji and entered his cage to beat him up, and Reiju stood nearby. After their brothers had left, she tended to Sanji's wounds, though she said she was not on his side as she did not want to be targeted as well. Reiju said that the modifications made to their bodies had made her brothers incapable of empathy, though they had not affected her in the same way. She then revealed to Sanji that they were about to traverse the Red Line to go to the East Blue and fight some wars there. Sanji was thrown into the wall as the ships comprising the Germa Kingdom split apart and climbed up the Red Line, and as his brothers laid in wait, Sanji revealed to Reiju that he wanted to become a chef, and a shocked Reiju told him to stop telling her things like that.
In the East Blue, the people of Cozia noticed Germa 66's presence and attacked them as Judge continued his troops' onslaught. Sanji asked Reiju if he would have to be around his father if he ran away into the East Blue, and Reiju told him to stand back as she bent the bars of his cell. She then ran off, reminding Sanji that he would get only one chance to escape. As Germa 66 began their invasion of Cozia, Sanji looked for the key to free him from his iron mask, but he was caught by Judge. Sanji pulled out a dagger as he told his father that no one would stop him from leaving. Judge expressed his disappointment at Sanji's insubordinate behavior and told him that since he was now a commoner, he would be sure to die out in the world. However, Judge then stated that he was happy to hear this, since his humanity had prevented him from killing Sanji but Sanji leaving now would fulfill his wish to eliminate his weak son. Judge then requested to Sanji that he should never identify himself as his offspring, since he was the one thing he was ashamed of. This caused Sanji to start bawling. Outside, the Germa 66 soldiers turned their attention to a cruise ship at the port, but left it alone due to it not being related to their mission. Having removed his iron mask, Sanji and Reiju stand outside, with Reiju telling Sanji to get on a ship and abandon his old life, saying that one day he would meet people who would treat him the way he deserved to be treated. She finally told him to not look back as he ran toward the ship in tears.","Vinsmoke Judge (flashback), Vinsmoke Niji, Vinsmoke Yonji, Vinsmoke Ichiji, Vinsmoke Reiju (flashback), Sanji, Vinsmoke Sora (flashback), Époni (flashback)",

She then unleashes Rain Spark, dousing all of Cracker's creations with rain. One of them strikes Luffy and blows him back, but its sword shatters, and Luffy is able to break them with a simple Gatling attack. Luffy and Nami realize that the biscuits have an edible composition when dampened, and Nami encourages Luffy to eat the Biscuit Soldiers. He does so, consuming parts of the Biscuit Soldiers, and with parts of them in Luffy's stomach, they are unable to regenerate and are thus disabled.

Reiju remarks that she fails to understand why Sanji came back here just for Zeff, though assures him that at least he will have the comfort of married life with Pudding. She then asks why he is so chivalrous, and Sanji explains. Back when he was a child on the Baratie, he and his coworkers begged Zeff to hire a female cook. Zeff refused, saying that he used kicks to discipline people, which he could not do on a woman. Sanji failed to understand why he could not kick a woman, causing Zeff to kick him on the head multiple times. Zeff explained to Sanji that kicking a woman was unbecoming of a man, and he would chop his own head off if Sanji did it because it meant he would have failed as a parent; Zeff's affirmation of his parental relationship with Sanji caused Sanji to be surprised.
In the Mirro-World, Brûlée searches for Chopper and Carrot, wondering where they could have gone after she put shackles on them. Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot once again fail to find a mirror with Sanji on the other side, and at that moment Brûlée appears before them.

Despite his exhaustion and anger, Cracker is confident that he can overwhelm Luffy; as Nami unleashes some more rain, Luffy does not think he can eat anymore.

After eating more of Cracker's biscuit soldiers, Luffy is so bloated that he is barely able to stand, and he says that he cannot take anymore. An exhausted Cracker gleefully tries to bring Luffy to the limit by sending more Biscuit Soldiers at him, but Luffy and Nami refuse to quit as the latter sprays the soldiers with rain once again and Luffy eats them despite feeling awful. An outraged Cracker wonders if Luffy's stomach is infinite, and although Luffy cannot even stand, he still faces off with the Sweet Commander. Nami declares that Luffy's stomach can take anything, although the homies around her object as Luffy is clearly at his limit. Luffy declares that he will not throw up all the biscuits he has eaten, and an enraged Cracker promises to make it less painful for him by stabbing him in the stomach. Cracker races toward Luffy himself with Pretzel at the ready, and in response, Luffy blows into his arm and activates Gear 4. However, this time Luffy takes on a much bigger and rounder form called Tankman: Full Version, and Cracker swings Pretzel at him, but is unable to cut through Luffy's Armament Haki.
Cracker then tries skewering Luffy, and after initially being unsuccessful again, he tries an even stronger attack. Once again, he cannot cut through Luffy, but the power of the thrust causes Pretzel to get sucked into Luffy's inflated body, dragging Cracker along with it. As he is trapped in the folds of Luffy's body, Cracker's remaining Biscuit Soldiers march toward Luffy, but Luffy tells Nami not to soften them with rain this time. Luffy then ejects Cracker from his body, sending him crashing through his Biscuit Soldiers at high velocity.

Cracker's siblings Charlotte Mont-d'Or, Charlotte Opera, and Charlotte Galette stand over him in shock, and realizing Luffy must have done this, they raise a state of alarm over Sweet City, causing the citizens to panic and evacuate.
Back in the Seducing Woods, Luffy deactivates Gear 4, and Pound comes out of a hiding spot, openly admitting he was scared of the battle. As Luffy lies on the ground, Nami rejoices in their victory, but no one shares her joy as Pound and Kingbaum look at her forlornly. They reveal that this event will ignite Big Mom's rage, just like when Urouge defeated Snack. When that happened, the enraged Big Mom unleashed a storm thanks to her control over a living thundercloud named Zeus and a living sun named Prometheus. As Cracker's massive fleet set out to take down Urouge, Big Mom's storm resulted in Urouge's ship being quickly shipwrecked. However, despite this threat, Luffy is still intent on rescuing Sanji, knowing they do not have too long before the wedding begins and hearing that Sanji is set to come to Big Mom's castle. He orders Kingbaum to carry him and Nami out of the Seducing Woods, and the homie is forced to comply once again due to Nami's Vivre Card. He wonders how they have that, saying that not even Big Mom's children are allowed to have one due to its power.
In the Mirro-World, Brûlée continues pursuing Chopper and Carrot, who have managed to hide in a corner. As they sit too exhausted to think clearly, Carrot suddenly sees Sanji standing in the mirror in front of her.

Ichiji gives him a red cape, which Sanji puts on as he takes his seat in the carriage.

Several days ago on Zou, Sanji had first received the summons from Capone Bege to go to Whole Cake Island and marry Charlotte Pudding, much to the shock of his crewmates, but he was prepared to face the consequences for them. When he had battled Cracker, Luffy confidently asserted that he would be getting Sanji back and after a hard fight, he finally managed to take down the Sweet Commander.

When the cooks returned to the ship, they met Sanji, who begged them to take him in since he dreamed of being a cook. On the Orbit and later the Baratie, Sanji told people about the All Blue, which he had read about in the Germa Kingdom, and was what drove him to struggle against Zeff when his crew attacked the Orbit. When Sanji was tossed overboard in a storm, Zeff dived in to save him and cut off his leg when it was caught in an anchor, and when the two of them were stranded on an island, Zeff gave Sanji all the food rations while pretending a bag of treasure was his food. Sanji came to truly realize Zeff was a real father to him when Zeff prohibited him from ever kicking a woman, saying it would bring dishonor to him as he raised Sanji.","Gin (flashback), Sanji, Monkey D.

Sanji claims that he will be happier in the ranks of the Big Mom Pirates, where he will be treated to power and luxury as opposed to the meager existence of the Straw Hats. He says that he has been looking down on Luffy and his crewmates the whole time and is willing to prove it as he activates Diable Jambe. He then charges at the motionless Luffy and kicks him in the face, sending him tumbling away.
Luffy gets back up to face Sanji, who says that he should use Haki if he wants to live.

As the Vinsmoke Family's carriage draws closer to the Whole Cake Chateau, the building's massive gates open, and a massive army of Big Mom's forces emerges from it. Sanji's brothers note that these forces are likely headed to bring down Luffy, and they boast several infamous pirates with high bounties. The brothers state with glee that Luffy's only hope of survival is to not stay in that spot like he told Sanji, and Sanji looks extremely conflicted.

However, Big Mom replies that it is natural to develop a killing instinct and tells all the children in the room to get excited for Pudding's wedding tomorrow. She then steps into the dining room where the Vinsmokes are, and their lunch begins. Big Mom and Judge have a toast to the formation of their alliance tomorrow, and Pudding comes in to eat. Tons of food homies then come to the table dancing and singing, and the Vinsmokes are perturbed at having to eat the living morsels. As everyone eats, Pudding slips Sanji a note asking him to meet with her privately later.
In the outskirts, the force of the storm has increased considerably and the enraged army has come into Luffy, Nami, and Kingbaum's view. Luffy tells Nami to run away, and Nami tries to get him to do so as well, but Luffy refuses to move from his spot because he wants to ensure he is there when Sanji comes back.

Episode 810,The End of the Adventure - Sanji's Resolute Proposal,"October 22, 2017","Luffy faces Big Mom's enraged army with determination, and decimates their hordes of Chess Soldiers. He struggles against the higher-ranking Big Mom Pirates, but Nami and Kingbaum come back to help him and Nami decimates all the Chess Soldiers with a massive lightning strike. As this battle rages on, Sanji talks to Pudding in her room and, in order to make the best of his situation, agrees to marry her tomorrow and make a life together.","Big Mom's enraged army stops to face Luffy, who tells Nami and Kingbaum to run away. Nami reluctantly complies, and the enraged army is incredulous at Luffy's fighting ability in his current physical state. However, Luffy does not pay any mind to their words and activates Gear 2, plowing through dozens of Chess Soldiers. Two Chess Soldiers manage to grab hold of Luffy and allow others to jump him, but Luffy repels them by inflating himself. More Chess Soldiers shoot arrows at Luffy, but he inhales more air into his body and twists around, exhaling hard enough to create a whirlwind that blows everything nearby away. Nami and Kingbaum see this as the latter carries the former away, and are awed and frightened by the spectacle.
In Pudding's room, she confesses to Sanji that she had arranged to get the Straw Hats to the coast of Whole Cake Island and bring him there to reunite with them, but was unable to uphold her word. However, Sanji replies that he would not have come to the coast anyways, as doing so would put the lives of his friends in jeopardy and get his hands destroyed. Pudding reveals that all people arranged to marry into the Charlotte Family have those exploding cuffs put on, and Sanji then takes his mask off, revealing his beaten face. He tells Pudding that this is the kind of treatment he receives from his family, which caused him to run away from them 13 years ago. Now, however, they are threatening the people that treated him like family, and with no way out of this situation, he has given in.
Back in the outskirts of Sweet City, Luffy continues pummeling Chess Soldiers, but Charlotte Opera goes on the offensive as he grabs Luffy with tentacles of cream. The cream's sweetness causes it to burn Luffy, but he manages to struggle his way out of it. However, he is then confronted by Bobbin, who bobs his head from side to side and emits waves that make Luffy fall asleep. When Luffy is incapacitated, Bobbin pulls out his sword and rushes at him, but Nami and Kingbaum suddenly come to the rescue. The enraged army members say that Kingbaum has committed mutiny against the Big Mom Pirates, although the homie did not willingly go back as he was forced to return by Nami's Vivre Card. Although Nami and Kingbaum are back on Luffy's side, the battle is still extremely uneven, and the fighting resumes. Meanwhile, in the Mirro-World, Randolph begins attacking Chopper and Carrot. He manages to overwhelm Carrot, who cannot dodge due to her shackles, but Chopper intercepts Randolph's strike and tells Carrot that they are done fighting as he throws the rabbit homie towards the ceiling.
Despite Kingbaum's pleas, the Chess Soldiers climb on him in order to reach Nami. However, they are all suddenly disabled due to the power of her Vivre Card, to Galette's shock. Meanwhile, Counter, Cadenza, and Cabaletta all race toward Luffy, who attacks them with Elephant Gun. The trio coat their arms in Armament Haki and clash with Luffy evenly. After a long struggle, Opera then comes in and floods Luffy in cream, burning his legs. Eventually, Luffy can no longer take the pain and gives ground, allowing Opera's brothers to overpower him and send him flying. As this happens, Sanji reflects on what his crewmates are currently going through in order to get him back, saying his adventure with them is over and that he does not wish for them to struggle. Nami strikes some Chess Soldiers with lightning, but more keep coming, and she gets the idea to use the storm clouds in the air. Unleashing another Weather Egg, she attracts a massive amount of storm energy into her cloud, allowing her to unleash a large quantity of purple lightning that takes out every Chess Soldier in sight. Everyone in the area is awed by this sight, and Luffy's drive to fight to stay and wait for Sanji is renewed. Back in Pudding's room, Pudding weeps in apology for making Sanji's life hell by being arranged to marry him and keep him away from his friends, but he tells her she has nothing to apologize for. Pudding tries assuring Sanji that she will not make their marriage hell, and he embraces her, deciding to aim for the best life afforded to him by marrying her without struggle tomorrow. As he seals this promise, the lightning from Nami's attack lights up the room.","Nami, Kingbaum, Monkey D.

In the battle with the enraged army, Amande kills Kingbaum by bisecting him, Galette immobilizes Nami, and although Luffy continues fighting here, he is eventually caught and defeated. He tries to remain in his waiting spot as the army drags him and Nami away, but is knocked out.","Luffy continues plowing through hordes of Chess Soldiers, and Charlotte Mascarpone and Joscarpone confront him. The two Snakenecks jab their spears at him, but Luffy dodges them and kicks them in the necks. Bobbin and more Chess Soldiers approach Luffy, and Bobbin says that Luffy is near his limit so they should keep attacking, but Luffy replies that he is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Nami assists Luffy by unleashing another massive round of thunderbolts, but before she can use Big Mom's storm clouds again, Galette binds her arms with a gelatinous substance. Covering Nami's body in a sparkly liquid substance, Galette forces her off of Kingbaum and onto her knees on the ground. Amande then walks up Kingbaum until she reaches his face, and unsheathes her Meito Shirauo. Kingbaum again tries to plead that he has no control over his actions, but Amande does not listen as she slowly brings her sword down into his body. She very slowly cuts him vertically, and the anguished homie begs her to kill him quickly, but she responds that it is only worthwhile to kill an enemy slowly and painfully. As Luffy continues fighting Chess Soldiers, Mont-d'Or stands above him on two levitating books and remarks that his feat is impressive because the Chess Soldiers are not weak and he is already worn from fighting Cracker. However, Opera comes in to attack Luffy again, and burns him with cream.
In the Mirro-World, Chopper and Carrot face off against Brûlée, Randolph, the Noble Croc, and Diesel. Chopper immediately goes on the offensive as he pummels the Noble Croc before intercepting Randolph's attack. Diesel races at a high speed to attack Carrot, but she dodges him even faster and he quickly has to turn around and parry her Electro strike. However, Brûlée emerges from a mirror behind Carrot, and Chopper barely manages to pull her out of the way of Brûlée's scythe. Brûlée's attack frees Chopper and Carrot from their chains, and she quickly enters another mirror. Suddenly, three reflection duplicates each of Chopper and Carrot come into the Mirro-World and subdue the two of them.
Luffy tries to attack Opera with Elephant Gun, but Mont-d'Or blocks his strike with a book, which seems to suck him in. Luffy is placed under the illusion that he is in the book's world, and when various threats in it come to attack him, he reacts to it in the real world despite no one attacking him, which confuses Nami. The Big Mom Pirates then take turns attacking Luffy while he is blinded, and Luffy is assaulted by both their real attacks and the fake attacks inside the book. Charlotte Counter and Cadenza bring it home by punching Luffy from both sides with massive Haki-imbued fists, and after their second attack, Luffy finally collapses. Meanwhile, Sanji walks down a corridor in the Whole Cake Chateau until he reaches Big Mom's throne room, where she sits eating desserts. Sanji tells her that he will marry Pudding without resisting, and in return, he requests that Big Mom spare his friends. Big Mom agrees to this deal, though points out that the Straw Hats have already committed egregious offenses against her. However, she will let them go because the wedding ceremony tomorrow is more important to her, and Sanji is overjoyed. Meanwhile, the enraged army rejoices in their victory and surveys the damage of the battle. Amande then approaches Nami and reaches into her dress, pulling out the Vivre Card she got from Lola. The army is shocked, and thinks Nami killed Lola, although Nami attempts to explain that they are friends. The army then takes her away, and Counter tries to pull Luffy off the ground, but to his surprise Luffy is still conscious and gripping onto the grass. Counter stomps Luffy multiple times, and eventually succeeds in knocking Luffy out and successfully pulling him away from the spot where he promised to wait for Sanji.","Monkey D.

As he talks, Smoothie wrings a liquid out of a woman like she is a cloth, and asks Tamago why they need extra security now. Tamago reveals that Pedro has been reported to be on the island, and the mink captain had attempted to steal their Poneglyphs five years ago. Brook is shocked at what he has seen and heard, and goes back to the wine cellar where he and Pedro are hiding. He tells Pedro about the level of security in the room, and they know they will not be able to get past all of it. However, since Tamago seems to be specifically keeping an eye out for Pedro, the duo get the idea to use the mink as bait.

Carrot is tied on a rope above it, and Brûlée's group looks forward to cooking and eating her.

However, Reiju starts to get weaker, and Pudding prepares to get assistance for her since Reiju needs to be present at the wedding. Noting that it was impressive how Reiju managed to run away from her for a bit after being shot in the leg, Pudding reaches into Reiju's head and pulls out a roll of film containing Reiju's memories with the power of the Memo Memo no Mi, focusing on Reiju's memories of being shot and running away before eventually collapsing and being captured. Pudding then cuts out Reiju's memories of their encounter, and replaces it with someone else's memory of being shot by a Chess Soldier's stray bullet in order to explain Reiju's injuries. Reiju falls unconscious, and Pudding has her taken to a medical ward to treat her injuries. During this time, Sanji leaves the area outside Pudding's room.
In the Room of Treasure, Brook stands firm against Big Mom in order to complete his mission of transcribing the Poneglyphs in her possession. Looking for an opening to get past Big Mom, Brook does not see any, but takes off as he runs up the wall. He then runs around the circumference of the room, his sheer speed causing Big Mom to struggle to keep up with him. However, when he manages to get behind her and attempts to attack, Big Mom quickly sees him and repels him with Prometheus. Brook does not manage to land any attacks thanks to Prometheus' and Zeus' tight defense, and the two weather homies assault him with powerful attacks. Brook then tries to overpower them with his soul power like he did to the Chess Soldiers, but although his music does give them great discomfort, they come out of it unaffected. They then injure him further with more powerful attacks, seemingly defeating him, but as Big Mom tries to grab him to take for her collection, he crawls away and slowly gets back up. Zeus and Prometheus get into an argument as to who should finish him off, causing Brook to spot an opening on Big Mom and rush in to attack her. However, Big Mom's bicorne homie Napoleon releases a sword hidden within it and slams into Brook. Big Mom then asks the nearly-defeated Brook if he has had enough, and is surprised to see him get up again. Brook states that he knows Sanji is likely here to sacrifice himself, and so will be unlikely to come back with them. Thus, if Luffy fails, he wants their mission to Whole Cake Island to at least be fruitful by acquiring Big Mom's Poneglyphs. Big Mom wonders why Brook does not consider the possibility of his team dying in this mission, but Brook retorts that no one considers the possibility of death in their quests.
In the Mirro-World, Carrot tickles Brûlée to force her to guide them to the mirrors in the Whole Cake Chateau. Brûlée cannot take it anymore and relents, revealing that although she does not immediately know which mirror leads where, Carrot and Chopper can ask them and they will respond. The duo ask which mirrors lead into the castle, and the mirrors identify themselves. They then ask if any of them have seen any of their comrades, but the mirrors are unable to identify their comrades by name. In order to identify their comrades, Carrot prepares to draw them, claiming herself to be a good artist.
In the Prisoner Library, Luffy's arms start to tear as he gets closer to ripping them off and freeing himself, despite Nami's constant attempts to stop him. Opera then confronts Nami, revealing that Big Mom ordered him to get Lola's location out of her while it is still nighttime. Nami refuses to sell out Lola, and Opera goes to get a crossbow, telling her that he will shoot her every five seconds until she gives an answer. Luffy promises to free himself in five seconds, causing Nami to become even more hysterical, when suddenly Jinbe enters the library. Opera is confused, since Jinbe is not currently allowed in the Chateau, but Jinbe simply apologizes as he hits Opera in the chest with Gosenmaigawara Seiken. With Opera downed, Jinbe prepares to free Luffy and Nami.","Sanji, Vinsmoke Reiju, Nitro, Charlotte Pudding, Rabiyan, Charlotte Linlin, Napoleon, Vinsmoke Judge (image), Brook, Prometheus, Zeus, Diesel, Tony Tony Chopper, Charlotte Brûlée, Carrot, Charlotte Opera, Monkey D.

Episode 819,"Sora's Wish - Germa's Failure, Sanji","December 24, 2017","Jinbe arrives at the Prisoner Library and works to free Luffy and Nami. Meanwhile, Sanji tells his sister about the awful truth of Pudding, and she confides in him about how their mother sacrificed her life for Sanji's humanity.","On Whole Cake Island, inside the Chateau infirmary, a doctor and a homie guard both comment on Reiju's incredible enhanced healing ability. As they talk, Sanji sneaks in undetected and ties and blindfolds the homie to a chair. Reiju then wakes, noticing Sanji's presence with surprise. She also inspects her injured leg while recalling foggily that she had been caught in a supposed crossfire. Sanji tells her that her memory has been overwritten, and proceeds to tell her what really happened.
In the Prisoner's Library, Jinbe burns the book imprisoning Luffy and Nami, in order to free them. Nami thanks Jinbe, but wonders why he is on the island. Jinbe explains that his Sun Pirates are subordinate to Big Mom's crew. Nami points out the knocked out Charlotte Opera, and comments with concern that his actions constitute rebellion, and Jinbe affirms that there's no going back now. He tells Luffy and Nami that they have to hide somewhere where they won't be found, while Luffy complains about being hungry. Jinbe wonders how Luffy can be worrying about his stomach at a time like this, but Luffy interjects that he didn't ask for any food. Luffy recalls Pudding's words and tells Jinbe to look after Nami, before running off to find and warn Sanji.
In the infirmary, Reiju tells Sanji that she believes his version of events as she had been investigating Pudding due to finding her suspicious. Sanji proceeds to bemoan his belief that his own sacrifice would secure the safety of his crew, as Reiju notes on how Judge underestimated Big Mom before stating that they should not stand in the way of the planned assassinations. A shocked Sanji objects immediately, not wanting Reiju to die, but a touched Reiju responds that Sanji owes her nothing for helping him escape the Germa Kingdom 13 years ago. She urges Sanji to escape Whole Cake Island as soon as possible, and to worry about protecting the Baratie once he is safely away.
Before Sanji can object further, Reiju divulges to him one of her strongest childhood memories. She recalls a fight between their father and mother, during which their mother refused to undergo the surgery which would transform their soon-to-be-born sons into emotionless machines. While she was ultimately unable to refuse the surgery, she secretly took a drug that counteracted (in part) the effects of the Lineage Factor manipulation surgery. The drug led to a sudden deterioration in her health, and did nothing to prevent the surgery's successful modification of Ichiji, Niji and Yonji. However, the scientists monitoring the Vinsmoke brothers began observing behaviors in Sanji that revealed that his modification had been unsuccessful. While Judge blamed Sanji for the drug's success, Sora cherished Sanji's displays of kindness, crying in happiness as she told Reiju and Eponi about Sanji's actions. After listening, a horrified Sanji begins to state that their mother's death was his fault, but Reiju overrides him and tells him that their mother was happy from the bottom of her heart, and did not regret a thing. Reiju continues by stating that Sanji cannot be a failure, and that he is in fact kinder than anyone, leaving Sanji speechless.
On the second floor of the Chateau, Luffy has taken hold of one of Big Mom's subordinates and is strangling him, trying to elicit Sanji's whereabouts. At the same time, in the Hall of Treasures, Charlotte Smoothie learns of Jinbe's rebellion and orders all homies and soldiers to seal off the fourth floor. Smoothie warns the soldiers not to inform Big Mom of the chaos inside the Chateau, and gives them permission to kill the rebels if necessary.
Back inside the infirmary, Reiju encourages Sanji to forget about Germa and leave. She reflects that Germa is nothing but a war machine that the world can do without, and that the Vinsmokes are a family of murderers that deserve death. Sanji continues his objections to Reiju's proposed self-sacrifice, but Reiju explains that she cannot disobey their father's commands. With Luffy fast approaching and leaving a trail of destruction behind him, Reiju states that she believes the Baratie is under no threat from Big Mom and (further) reveals that Sanji's handcuffs are fakes she had switched out with the real pair. Reiju concludes by telling Sanji forcefully to consider what was most important in his life; in particular, she emphasizes that he will never again meet people as amazing the ones he has now, for as long as he lives.","Vinsmoke Reiju, Sanji, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 820,To Reach Sanji - Luffy's Vengeful Hell-Bent Dash!,"January 7, 2018","In the Chateau courtyard, Tamago regenerates into a stronger form with chicken features known as Viscount Hiyoko with his Devil Fruit power. Pedro fights Hiyoko and manages to defeat this form, but before Hiyoko regenerates into a stronger form, Pedro lights a string of bombs and attempts to take out all the surrounding enemies in a massive explosion. In the Room of Treasure, Brook's sword is unable to pierce Big Mom's skin, and he is finally defeated, but not before managing to injure Prometheus. Outside the room, Smoothie hears about Luffy's breakout and orders the floors below them to be blocked off so Big Mom does not find out. Pudding then comes in, and Big Mom reveals to Brook that she can awaken the ability to read the Poneglyphs with her third eye. Pudding asks Big Mom if they can talk in the latter's room.
Below, Luffy fights against Charlotte Cadenza in his race to find Sanji, and knocks out the pirate after choking him for Sanji's location. In the infirmary, Reiju encourages Sanji to escape and leave their family to die, revealing that she replaced the explosive cuffs on his wrists with duds, which will allow him to leave without repercussions.","After he is cut in half, a giant yolk flies out of Baron Tamago's body. To his surprise, the seemingly victorious Pedro watches as the yolk reforms into a different version of Tamago, who is covered in yellow, possesses a chicken beak and wings, and wields two daggers. The Big Mom Pirates around them cheer on as Tamago's new form, Viscount Hiyoko, attacks Pedro while making clucking noises. Hiyoko is an improved swordfighter, and he barrages Pedro with rapid attacks that the jaguar mink has trouble keeping up with them. Hiyoko goes so fast that he becomes a whirlwind of motion, and manages to knock Pedro's sword and send it flying a good distance away. Pedro races to his sword, and Hiyoko rapidly pursues him, but Pedro retrieves it in the nick of time and cuts Hiyoko in half, sending the yolk out of his body once again. Hiyoko's crewmates cheer at the impending evolution, revealing that he will turn into Count Niwatori with the power of the Tama Tama no Mi, which allows him to evolve each time he is destroyed. They claim Niwatori to be a ""true knight"" who will surely overpower Pedro. However, Pedro decides to attack him in the midst of the evolution, much to the shock of the Big Mom Pirates. They charge at him, but he pulls out a string of bombs that he promptly lights, sending them fleeing in fear. Pedro then sets off a massive explosion that sends the pirates and Count Niwatori flying, and seemingly engulfs himself.
In the Room of Treasure, Brook is near his limit against Big Mom, but mounts a charge in order to complete his task. Big Mom has Zeus and Prometheus attack him, but Brook withstands their lightning and fire as he spins past them in a fiery blaze and strikes Big Mom with his sword. However, to his shock, his attack has only pressed Big Mom's skin a little bit without penetrating it. Big Mom then retaliates by smacking him into the ground, and Brook is left unable to get up. However, as Zeus and Prometheus attack him some more, he unleashes an attack while lying down, which manages to cut Prometheus despite the homie being made of fire. Big Mom then finishes off Brook by smashing him into the wall, and as she captures him, Smoothie hears about Luffy rampaging through the castle as she stands outside the room. Knowing that Big Mom would not react kindly to more events threatening the wedding tomorrow, and that she might take it out on them, Smoothie orders her subordinates to bar off the entrance to the fourth level from all the levels below, and to deal with the problem without telling Big Mom.
Inside the room, Brook is stripped, and the Chess Soldiers do not find any stolen objects in his clothes. This lightens Big Mom's mood around Brook as she coddles him as her new pet, and she commends him for overpowering her Chess Soldiers. However, she reveals that he was unable to overpower her special homies, Zeus, Prometheus, and Napoleon, because they were made with pieces of her own soul. She is relieved that he was not trying to steal the Poneglyphs, revealing that Gol D. Roger managed to sneak in and read them with his ability to hear the Voice of All Things, allowing him to reach Laugh Tale. She planned to become the next Pirate King, as she now had a key to be able to hear the Voice of All Things as well. Pudding then enters the room, and Big Mom asks her if she has awakened her third eye's ability yet. The exasperated Pudding states that it may be impossible due to her being a half-breed, and Big Mom says that the third eye is just an ugly feature on her if it cannot be useful. Brook is surprised to hear of Pudding's third eye, and the two of them spot and recognize each other. Pudding, surprised that Brook got here, asks Big Mom if they can talk privately in her quarters.
Meanwhile, Luffy continues fighting his way through the Whole Cake Chateau to get to Sanji. He runs into Charlotte Cadenza, who is intent on stopping him. Recognizing Cadenza as one of the two fighters who defeated him in the battle outside Sweet City, Luffy attacks him, but Cadenza manages to stand his ground with his Armament Haki. However, when Cadenza attacks, Luffy gets behind him and puts him in a chokehold, ordering the pirate to tell him where Sanji is. However, Cadenza refuses to say, causing him to pass out. Meanwhile, Reiju pleads with Sanji to leave the infirmary, saying that the Germa are nothing but warmongers trying to reclaim the past and they deserve to be erased from history. Even though she has this view, she accepts her death as well, since she was programmed to be forced to obey her father's commands and was guilty of partaking in the Germa's actions. However, she wants Sanji to live on with his conscience and return to his home with the Straw Hats. Reiju believes that since Big Mom wants Germa's technology, it is unlikely she will target Zeff. With Sanji still not leaving, Reiju then reveals that she replaced the exploding cuffs on his wrists with fakes, which will allow him to return to Luffy without fear of repercussions. As Luffy fights several Big Mom Pirates who came to attack him after Cadenza's defeat, Sanji gains his resolve.","Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Luffy continues running through the chateau and is confronted by Cabaletta, who intends to avenge Cadenza. After a furious clash, Luffy manages to defeat Cabaletta and continues onward. Luffy eventually comes across the infirmary, where Reiju hides him from the pursuing Big Mom Pirates. Reiju informs Luffy that Sanji has been made aware of Pudding's deception and Luffy decides to return to the place where he promised to wait for Sanji. After jumping out of the Chateau and landing in Sweet City, Luffy is confronted by Chess Soldiers as he is traveling to his intended destination.
While wandering in the hallways of the Chateau, Sanji decides that he will not return to the Straw Hats.","In the aftermath of Pedro's explosion in the Chateau courtyard, Count Niwatori gets up, having only received minor injuries. After seeing the remains of the explosion, with no traces of Pedro to be found, Niwatori orders his subordinates to get the wounded to medical attention and put out the fires in the courtyard. Pedro is alive and with Chopper and Carrot in the Mirro-World. He recalls how the two of them found him through a mirror during his battle, and he immediately hatched a plan to end the fight by detonating the dynamite. Once he did it, he quickly ran into the mirror right before the explosion reached him. Chopper, Carrot, Pedro, and the captive Brûlée then ride on Diesel's cart as they look for their remaining teammates, knowing Luffy and Nami were captured. Carrot shows the mirrors her drawing of her teammates, but to Pedro's shock, they are all drawn as bishōnen. However, the mirrors recognize the drawings and reveal that they have seen Nami with Jinbe, and Chopper is surprised to hear Jinbe's name. On the first floor of the Chateau, Nami and Jinbe run away from a horde of Big Mom Pirates. The duo quickly find themselves surrounded, and Nami shocks some of the horde with a lightning blast, but unwittingly hits Chopper after he comes out of a nearby mirror. Nami and Jinbe then see Carrot through the mirror, and she tells them to get inside, much to their astonishment.
Meanwhile, Luffy keeps fighting past the Big Mom Pirates as he advances to the third floor where Sanji is, but he is then confronted by Cabaletta. Luffy initially mistakes Cabaletta for his quintuplet brother Cadenza, but Cabaletta corrects him as he prepares to avenge Cadenza's defeat. Saying that unlike Cadenza, he does not just boast physical strength, Cabaletta moves around in the blink of an eye, attempting to hit Luffy with Armament Haki-imbued arms before Luffy can react. The two of them rapidly punch at each other, but end up in a stalemate. Luffy then shows weakness as his stomach growls from his extreme hunger, allowing Cabaletta to put him in a headlock. With Luffy being unable to escape, Cabaletta tells him that Sanji betrayed him and asks if Luffy really wants to rescue him. Cabaletta's statement about Sanji makes Luffy very angry, allowing him to break out of the headlock and grab Cabaletta's hair, preventing him from moving. Luffy then hits Cabaletta into a wall with Hawk Rifle, defeating him. He immediately continues his search for Sanji, and the rest of the Big Mom Pirates are reluctant to keep chasing him, but do so anyway.
Luffy continues looking around through the third floor when he is suddenly pulled into the infirmary by Reiju, who locks the door to prevent his pursuers from getting in. Luffy tells Reiju that he needs to warn Sanji about Pudding's deception, but Reiju reveals that Sanji found out about it just a little while ago. She also says that she told him to flee the island, but he is concerned about the threat of Zeff and the Baratie being held hostage. Luffy proclaims that he will go to defend the Baratie if they are in trouble, and with his hunger strike for Sanji on his mind and knowing that he did everything to help his cook, Luffy leaves the Chateau by jumping out the window. He lands on top of someone's house and destroys it. He struggles to move due to his hunger as he heads back to the spot where he promised to wait for Sanji, but Luffy is confronted by Chess soldiers along the way. Back in the Chateau, however, Sanji decides not to leave and accepts his fate, saying he could not go back after what he had done to his crewmates.","Niwatori, Pedro, Carrot, Tony Tony Chopper, Charlotte Brûlée, Diesel, Monkey D.

They first find that Brook had been captured by Big Mom, deducing that he is no longer a threat. However, they mistakenly believe that Pedro killed himself with the dynamite vest, and Chopper and Carrot had been captured by Brûlée. To avoid embarrassment, Opera lies about Luffy and Nami's escape, stating that they were burned alive by the fire. Deducing that all intruders have been caught or killed, Mont-d'Or dismisses the meeting, but orders soldiers to watch Opera out of suspicion.

In the Mirro-World, Chopper, Carrot, Nami, Jinbe, and Pedro ask the mirrors for information about Luffy, Sanji, and Brook's whereabouts, but they are initially unsuccessful. They then take notice of a very large mirror up ahead, and Brûlée gets excited about it. Pedro forces Diesel to pull their cart faster, even though Diesel cannot move fast due to the number of people he is pulling. The group reaches the mirror and spots Brook on the other side, but they then realize in shock that he is being held by a sleeping Big Mom. They try to call out to Brook without waking up Big Mom, but are unsuccessful, and Brûlée and Diesel call out to Big Mom, forcing the Sanji Retrieval Team to bind and gag them.

Big Mom's tossing and turning causes Brook to fall off the bed, and Nami runs straight to her crewmate. She wakes Brook up, but Brook screams after seeing his dummy, which wakes Big Mom up. Thinking the fly is still there, Big Mom grabs Prometheus and throws it onto the ground where Nami and Brook are.

Sanji later arrives and finds Luffy, who wakes up from the smell of Sanji's bento. Sanji gives the bento to Luffy, relieving his hunger. Sanji once again attempts to convince Luffy to leave without him, but in response, Luffy punches him and forces him to say his true feelings. Sanji then tearfully admits that he wants to return to the Straw Hats but could not abandon his family. Happy to hear Sanji's answer, Luffy decides to help him crash the wedding.","Before Sanji found Luffy, it is recounted how Bobbin attempted to steal the food from his bento box, causing him to kick Bobbin and run away. As Sanji headed to the outskirts of Sweet City, Luffy fought against Charlotte Counter. Counter initially managed to easily overpower Luffy, but Luffy eventually managed to find the strength and resolve to stand up and counter Counter's strikes. The two traded punches, and Luffy ultimately collapsed, but was able to deal enough blows to Counter's head to make him fall unconscious before he could deal the finishing blow. The barely conscious Luffy then made his way toward the spot where he promised to wait for Sanji, dragging himself all the way to Kingbaum's corpse with his last ounce of his strength. After reaching the outskirts of Sweet City, Sanji initially had difficulty finding Luffy among the many fallen Big Mom Pirates, but finally located him by his growling stomach and approached him.
In the present, Luffy is unconscious as Sanji approaches him, but Luffy smells the bento Sanji brought and opens his eyes. Luffy is happy to see Sanji, but Sanji treats him coldly as he hands him the bento basket. Although the bento is ruined because it was dropped and soaked in the rain, Luffy eats it and proclaims it to be delicious. He notes that the bento contains the favorite foods of the whole crew, and says that Sanji should come back and make it for all of them, but Sanji states that he is not coming back. He lists three reasons for not doing so: him attacking Luffy, Zeff and the Baratie being held hostage to deter him from escaping, and his desire to save his family from being assassinated at the wedding despite them only ever being cruel to him. However, Luffy gets angry at the insincerity of the statement and punches Sanji into Kingbaum's corpse. As Sanji recovers, Luffy tells him to say how he really feels. Sanji then has memories of making food for the crew. He once got mad at Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper for sneaking food into their mouths, but the crew only had fun as they clamored for more of his cooking. In the present, Sanji starts to weep and after a big effort, he manages to confess to Luffy that he wants to return to the Sunny and the crew, though he cannot bring himself to abandon his family. In response, Luffy smiles and promises to help Sanji crash the wedding tomorrow. As the two reconcile, the storm dies down as dawn breaks.
In Sweet City, the second son of the Charlotte Family and one of the Big Mom Pirates' Three Sweet Commanders Charlotte Katakuri approaches the Whole Cake Chateau with a henchman. The henchman offers to contact someone to open the gates, but Katakuri replies that there is no need, as they will open soon. Katakuri's words quickly prove to be accurate as the gates soon open, and the duo enters the Chateau. There are five hours and 30 minutes left before Big Mom's Tea Party and the wedding of Sanji and Pudding begins.","Monkey D.

Jinbe proceeds to talk about Bege's past before revealing that he plots to assassinate Big Mom during the tea party. Jinbe then proposes forming an alliance with him.","In the Mirro-World, Chopper finds a shard of a mirror that had been broken previously. With this shard, he is able to communicate with Luffy, who found the other shard near Kingbaum's body. They update each other on the situation, and plan to crash the upcoming tea party and wedding.
At Big Mom's castle, Charlotte Daifuku, another officer of the Big Mom Pirates, appears at the gate. Chess soldiers offer to open the door, but Daifuku uses his Devil Fruit ability to summon a genie to pry the gate open.
Meanwhile, back in the Mirro-World, Jinbe tells more about Capone Bege's past. Bege was the leader of one of the five mafia groups in West Blue. He gained notoriety for his method of attacking other mafia groups; he would assassinate the leaders of each group and steal their valuables, leaving the rest of the group intact. He would grow bored of attacking on land and formed the Fire Tank Pirates, using the same methods to attack various pirate crews until he entered the Worst Generation. To gain even more influence, he became affiliated with the Big Mom Pirates, and he would be in charge of security during the upcoming tea party.
Jinbe reveals, to everyone's shock, that Bege intends to assassinate Big Mom. Bege previously shot Pekoms because he refused to join his plot. However, Jinbe confirms that Pekoms was saved by the Sun Pirates, and that he is indeed alive.
Although Luffy was initially hostile to Bege, Jinbe instead advises Luffy to form an alliance with him to take down the Emperor.","Kingbaum, Monkey D.

Episode 827,A Secret Meeting! Luffy vs. the Fire Tank Pirates,"March 4, 2018","The Sanji Retrieval Team goes to the Fire Tank Pirates' hideout to meet Capone Bege.
Meanwhile, the Sun Pirates tend to an injured Pekoms and guard him to prevent him from reporting to Big Mom.
While Nami and Carrot are bathing, they have a conversation with Charlotte Chiffon, who explains about Lola's arranged marriage with Loki, the prince of Elbaf, and how Lola running away from the marriage cost Big Mom an alliance with the giants.
After finishing bathing and changing clothes, the Sanji Retrieval Team meets Bege in person.","The Big Mom Pirates's head chef Streusen leads several other cooks in making the wedding cake for the upcoming wedding, singing a song connecting the cooking to life in the process. At the eastern inlet of Whole Cake Island, Pekoms is kept under the watch of the Sun Pirates. Aladine assures him that Jinbe has reported Bege's treachery to Big Mom, and his crewmates readily back him up, but this only causes Pekoms to grow suspicious, and the Sun Pirates grow worried as he resists their lies.
Luffy and Sanji make their way to the Fire Tank Pirates' hideout, where they are greeted by Vito, who is excited to see Sanji. Chopper, who looks like he has come out of the bath, comes out and reunites with his crewmates, and Luffy and Sanji are confused about his appearance. Chopper confirms that he has been bathing, which Luffy does not like as he wants to meet with Bege quickly. However, Vito reveals that Bege will not meet with them until they are clean, and the scuffed-up Luffy and Sanji realize that they will have to bathe.
In the women's bath, Nami and Carrot talk to Chiffon while they bathe. Nami tells her about her experiences with her sister Lola, and wonders about Big Mom telling her in rage about a time that Lola ran away from her arranged marriage. Chiffon reveals that no giants live on Totto Land because they have a bad relationship with Big Mom, but this nearly changed when Loki, the prince of Elbaf, fell in love with Lola at first sight and proposed to her. However, after Lola refused to marry him and ran away, Big Mom attempted to use Chiffon as a substitute, but the giants quickly realized the deception and their relations with Big Mom only grew worse. Ever since, Big Mom has given up on trying to mend relations with the giants and has focused instead on turning people into giants, which she had commissioned Caesar Clown to work on. Big Mom hated Lola for ruining her efforts toward reconciliation, and this hatred extended to Chiffon as well for looking exactly like Lola. This resulted in Chiffon being abused every time Big Mom saw her, and with her frequent wounds still on her mind, Chiffon has no problem with Bege's plan to assassinate her mother. She notes that Lola probably does not even know Big Mom wants to kill her because of her happy-go-lucky personality.
Elsewhere, after bathing, Luffy and Brook get some milk from the fridge to heal their injuries despite the Fire Tank Pirate guard's disapproval. To his shock, Luffy regains his lost tooth and Brook's head injuries heal thanks to the milk. With everyone clean, the Sanji Retrieval Team picks out new outfits, with Luffy initially donning the costume of the robot from Sora, Warrior of the Sea. Sanji leaves the room and runs into Nami, and as she passes by him, she tells him that she will make him work hard for her when he rejoins them, but this just makes him ecstatic. Brûlée and Diesel have bathed as well, and they sit tied up in the hallway. Brûlée gets angry at Chiffon for going against her family, but Chiffon states that Bege and Pez are her family now and Lola's life is in danger. The Sanji Retrieval Team makes their way to the meeting room, and Luffy looks around for Bege. Bege then arrives and prepares to see whether or not this potential alliance can work out.
In Sweet City, Big Mom's fourth son Charlotte Oven heads to the Whole Cake Chateau. The liquid on the ground sizzles when he steps in it, and when the gatekeepers prepare to open the entrance for him, he says there is no need as he steps into the door and melts it, allowing him to enter.

Episode 828,The Deadly Pact - Luffy & Bege's Allied Forces!,"March 18, 2018","The meeting between the Sanji Retrieval Team and the Fire Tank Pirates begins. Luffy wants to punch Bege for what he did to Pekoms and after a brief quarrel, Jinbe convinces everyone to put their differences aside.
Bege reveals that he recruited Caesar for his assassination plot and goes over his plan to assassinate Big Mom. After Bege explains about an incident concerning the photo of Mother Carmel, Luffy agrees to be the bait.","The Sanji Retrieval Team meets with the Fire Tank Pirates, and before any words are exchanged, Luffy helps himself to food from a bin on the table. Bege begins by saying that he considers the Straw Hats to be pests, and wonders why he should not kill them. Sanji points out that killing him would prevent the wedding and ruin Bege's plot, which Bege concedes to. Luffy sits in silence for a while before he finally recognizes Caesar Clown, who has slicked up his hair and is sitting with the Fire Tank Pirates.
Caesar gets scared when Luffy recognizes him, remembering how he got to be here. He was sitting around and drinking inside Big Mom's factory, having given up on making a gigantification serum for her. Suddenly, Bege and the Fire Tank Pirates broke into the lab. Bege had taken the position of guarding Caesar, and offered him a chance to escape and work for him, coercing Caesar with the scientist's disembodied heart. Caesar was brought to work on a weapon, and was appalled when Vito informed him the Straw Hats would be coming to meet them. This caused him to slightly change his appearance, and in the present he says he is ""Gangster"" Gastino, but his disguise fools no one but Luffy and Chopper. After this exchange, Bege asks if Luffy wants to form an alliance or not. In response, Luffy tries to punch Bege for shooting Pekoms. Gotti and the Fire Tank Pirates immediately become hostile, and Jinbe tries blocking Luffy's punch, warning him strongly against fighting. However, Bege sits in anticipation of the attack and Jinbe is unable to stop Luffy as Bege intercepts the punch with Caesar's heart and he and Luffy scuffle briefly.
In another area of Whole Cake Island, the people there look on as Big Mom's wedding guests, the emperors of the Underworld, arrive and disembark from their ships. Back in Bege's hideout, the fighting has ended as the Sanji Retrieval Team inquires as to how Big Mom can be assassinated. Bege says that they will have a five-second window to kill her, but it will not come easily, and any slip-up will cause them to be overwhelmed by Big Mom's top crew members. However, they will be able to do it with the help of Caesar. Caesar gets mad when he hears Bege using his real name, and warns him to keep his agreement to return his heart after the assassination, or else he will kill Pez. Chiffon simply asserts that Bege will keep his promise, and as the Straw Hats laugh at him, Caesar goes to show them his new invention. He unveils the KX Launcher, which on detonation will inject a very deadly substance into the body and is guaranteed to kill anyone upon penetrating their skin.
However, Bege states that even this weapon cannot penetrate Big Mom's tough skin, which has not been wounded by bullets, cannonballs, or sinking ships. He reveals, though, that Big Mom keeps a portrait of a mysterious disappeared woman known as Mother Carmel and puts it across from her during every tea party. During the previous one, a servant accidentally knocked it off the table and slightly damaged it, which caused Big Mom to go into a breakdown and emit a shriek that paralyzed everyone. She also unleashed her Supreme King Haki, but when she fell to her knees during this, she noticeably scraped them. Thus, the plan to kill her during the wedding ceremony will center around destroying the portrait. The alliance will have earplugs to protect themselves from the shriek, and the interval during Big Mom's breakdown will give them the opportunity to shoot her with the KX Launchers. However, the portrait will not be reached easily, and so Bege asks Luffy to cause a distraction and disrupt the wedding. Despite his crew's protests, Luffy agrees to this. Three hours remain until the wedding.","Jinbe, Carrot, Nami, Monkey D.

The servant nervously assured him that Sanji had been in his room the whole time. Mont-d'Or is skeptical and glares at him, until Sanji tells him he has to prepare for the wedding.
Sanji tries to close the door but Mont-d'Or stops him, as he has something to tell Sanji. Exasperated, Sanji asks what it is and Mont-d'Or tells him Straw Hat died to test his reaction.

Bege and his crew act as security for the wedding. When the Vinsmoke Family arrives, they are asked to relinquish their weapons and raid suits.
As the Sanji Retrieval Team prepares for Bege's operation, Luffy goes to the Seducing Woods to catch animals.
At the venue, an angry guest Jigra is trying to force his way in only to be shot down by Charlotte Katakuri. Shortly afterwards, the Organ Trading Assassin Group attacks the venue but they are easily defeated by Daifuku and Oven.
After all the guests arrive at the venue, Big Mom appears and the tea party begins.","As Sanji walks down the hall in the Whole Cake Chateau, he remembers overhearing Pudding reveal to Reiju the Big Mom Pirates' plan to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family. However, when he enters the waiting room and sees Pudding in her wedding dress, he is immediately consumed by lust, to his horror. Meanwhile, the rest of the Vinsmoke Family approaches the gates to the wedding venue, but they are stopped by the Fire Tank Pirates, who tell them that they will need to go through a body check. The Vinsmokes reluctantly hand in their weapons upon demand, but are taken aback when they are told to also hand in their Raid Suits. Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji consider forcing their way through the security, and Niji and Bege nearly clash, but Judge stops them. He decides to comply with the Big Mom Pirates' wishes, and Bege welcomes them to the Tea Party. Inside Bege's body, the Straw Hats go over the wedding venue map to plan their attack, but Luffy is running around with a net. He says he is ready, assuring his crewmates that everything will turn out alright.
Outside the Whole Cake Chateau, Big Mom's Tea Party guests arrive just in time by a pig-drawn carriage. Out of the carriage come the Emperors of the Underworld: Lu Feld, Stussy, Drug Peclo, Morgans, Giberson, and Umit. The emperors are greeted by adoring crowds as they banter amongst themselves, with Feld and Peclo exchanging insults and Morgans being excited to cover Germa 66, who is a big part of his newspaper the World Economic Journal. Perospero greets the guests, and creates a candy escalator with his Devil Fruit power to take them up to the venue. He offers some children lollipops, saying they can lick the escalator too in a few minutes, before he too leaves for the wedding. At the venue, the tea party celebration gets into motion as the emperors arrive. Smoothie greets them and offers them drinks, and she squeezes liquid out of a giraffe.
Outside, an organ trader named Jigra tries to get past the Fire Tank Pirates' security without going through a body check, saying that he was invited to the previous tea party, but went to his mother's funeral instead. However, as he reveals that Big Mom sent him his hospitalized father's head in a box, he is suddenly shot through the head by a jelly bean. Bege and his crew look up to see Charlotte Katakuri sitting on the gate wall above them and flicking another jellybean with his finger; Bege wants to know why he killed a wedding guest. Katakuri reveals that Jigra was going to attempt to get revenge for his father and shoot down two of Bege's crewmates, which unnerves Bege, as he knows that Katakuri will be one of their biggest obstacles in the assassination plan due to his Observation Haki being advanced enough to let him see a little bit into the future. Katakuri then reveals that 100 raiders are coming, and the Organ Dealing Assassination Group rushes onto the scene. Cursing Jigra for not waiting for them, they begin to attack, and Katakuri foresees the Fire Tank Pirates being overwhelmed by them as the organ dealers withstand their volleys of bullets. Once this happens, Katakuri shoots one of the organ dealers with a jellybean, and his brothers Daifuku and Oven leap out of the venue. The organ traders look forward to harvesting the Big Mom Pirates' organs, and one of them wraps chains around Oven, but Oven heats up his body and melts the chains as he hits one of the dealers with a hot fist and melts the weapons of everyone nearby. Fearing the brothers' power, the organ dealers begin to escape, but Daifuku scoffs as he summons a massive genie-like figure that deals a massive blow powerful enough to take them out, and the organ dealers are left in awe, calling the brothers ""monsters"".
In the Seducing Woods, meanwhile, Luffy chases after several animals with his net. He initially loses sight of them, but two monkeys fall out of a tree when their branch breaks, and Luffy excitedly moves to capture them.

Meanwhile, Sanji struggles to not be fooled by Pudding's facade as the two of them practice their vows before being flown out to the venue.","Inside the Whole Cake Chateau, Sanji and Pudding rehearse their vows with a priest. The priest states that the marriage will be sealed with a kiss, and Sanji notes that this will be when Pudding attempts to shoot him. However, when Pudding talks to him, he is quickly taken aback by her beauty and struggles to remind himself of who she truly is.
Outside the wedding venue, Bege checks on the Straw Hats' status, but finds Luffy leaning out of his body to look around. Luffy opens up the doors in Bege's body and jumps across them before being punched and taken back by Nami, and Bege remarks that he maybe should have killed them. Vito then calls out from atop the venue wall, remarking in excitement that Morgans is talking to Judge. He then reveals that Katakuri, Smoothie, Perospero, Compote, Daifuku, and Oven of the Charlotte Family are all in attendance, noting their strength and remarking that they will not be good enemies to have. The gate homie nearby is taken aback to hear that, and Bege tells Vito and Gotti to go check downstairs. Inside the Whole Cake Chateau, two of the Fire Tank Pirates are disguised as cooks and report to Bege that the cooks are enjoying a banquet after having made the wedding cake. With all passages and signals to the wedding venue closed off, the Fire Tank Pirates go off to complete their next task. However, they are stopped by a drunk cook, who notes that he does not recognize them. However, the cook is struck down by Gotti as he and Vito arrive.
Inside the wedding venue, some Chess Soldiers carry the portrait of Mother Carmel and place it on the table in front of Big Mom. She is joyful to see it, but no one else knows who Carmel is. When one person asks how she is related to Big Mom, Big Mom shouts at him to not intrude on her memories as she releases her Supreme King Haki and knocks him out. Her guests then present her with gifts that they acquired from exotic locations, and Morgans asks about the report of her acquiring a great undersea treasure. Big Mom confirms this, revealing the Tamatebako from Fish-Man Island, which she plans to open during the feast after Pudding's wedding. Outside, Bege's men return to him with their mission completed, and Bege tells Caesar to come out of his body with the mirror. Caesar does so, and Bege briefs him on his role, telling him that he will be flying the mirror into the venue once they assassinate Big Mom so they can escape. At this point, the gate homie realizes that the Fire Tank Pirates are plotting something, but her face is then immediately sliced off by Gotti. Bege then goes inside his body to check on the Straw Hats, only to find everyone except Jinbe sleeping. Jinbe says that they have gone a while without sleep, and promises to wake them up ten minutes before the wedding starts. With everything ready, Bege has his subordinates enter his body and goes into the venue, saying that there is no turning back now.
Back in Sanji and Pudding's room, Sanji attempts to make conversation with Pudding, trying to act nervous about the upcoming affair. Pudding answers sweetly, making him lovestruck and causing him to struggle to remember her true nature. He asks if Pudding does not want to be kissed on the mouth, and Pudding says that she does, which causes him to get a nosebleed that makes him rocket around the room and stains his suit in blood. Pudding acts concerned, but is really extremely appalled and angered by Sanji's display of foolishness. Sanji is treated, and he and Pudding prepare to be brought out to the wedding venue, with Pudding gleefully anticipating her planned assassination. In the wedding venue, the Charlotte Family talks with the Vinsmoke Family about the imminent union between their two families, and Big Mom and Judge make a toast. Bege talks with Perospero, and they talk about preparing for the upcoming event. Inside Bege's body, everyone except Luffy is awake and ready to go as Sanji and Pudding arrive on a teacup carried by Zeus.

Sanji says that her third eye is beautiful, something that no one else has said to her before. Pudding breaks down in tears, causing Big Mom's plan to go awry. Katakuri tries to assassinate Sanji himself but fails.
Afterwards, Luffy and his duplicates intrude into the venue by bursting out of the wedding cake.","Inside Bege's body, Jinbe cannot wake Luffy up despite punching him multiple times. With barely any time left until the ceremony and the gunshot, Nami says that since Luffy was running around before he fell asleep, he will need meat to wake him up, and some Fire Tank Pirates rush to get some. Outside in the wedding venue, Streusen and his cooks sing before Streusen plunges his sword into the ground, causing it to break and the massive wedding cake to rise up. Big Mom compliments Streusen on the cake, and Sanji and Pudding are brought to the altar on top of it. As they draw closer to it, Pudding embraces Sanji and feigns nervous excitement while Sanji is lustfully ecstatic, although internally Pudding expresses her contempt with Sanji and is eager to murder him while Sanji keeps his mind on Pudding's true intentions. The two of them reach the altar and stand in front of the priest, and Big Mom excitedly anticipates the imminent assassination of the Vinsmokes. Judge, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji are completely unaware of what is about to happen, with Yonji wishing he could have married Pudding before Niji reminds him that doing so would enslave him to the Charlotte Family. Reiju looks around at the powerful Big Mom Pirates surrounding them and anticipates her family's death, having no desire for salvation but hoping that Sanji can escape.
Inside Bege's body, Luffy is given a lot of meat and gorges on it, but Jinbe quickly pulls him away with the gunshot being imminent. Outside, after the priest recites the vows, he calls for Pudding's veil to be lifted up so she and Sanji can perform the kiss of oath and seal their marriage. Sanji lifts up the veil, and anticipation is high as Pudding readies her gun and shows Sanji her third eye. Sanji is shocked as expected, but before Pudding can shoot him, he compliments her third eye and calls it beautiful. This stuns Pudding, who begins to break down as she remembers her painful childhood where other children bullied her for it. Even Big Mom had openly remarked on its ugliness and told her to grow bangs over it. Pudding is unable to contain this sudden rush of emotion and collapses to her knees, shocking and angering her family and crew.
Big Mom then signals for the priest to shoot Sanji, but Katakuri foresees the priest's shot missing and so attempts to shoot Sanji himself. However, Sanji ends up dodging Katakuri's flicked jellybean and it hits the priest instead, whose gun goes off as he falls backwards. The Sanji Retrieval Team, being pulled by Diesel through the Mirro-World, hears the gunshot and Luffy gets excited to make his entrance. Outside, the wedding venue instantly becomes extremely volatile and uneasy after Katakuri's actions, and Katakuri stands in front of Big Mom as he anticipates something happening that he cannot stop.

Episode 833,Returning the Sake Cup! The Manly Jinbe Pays His Debt,"April 22, 2018","Luffy's duplicates burst out of the wedding cake and they run amok at the wedding venue as the cake collapses. Following Bege's plan, Luffy goes after Carmel's photo. However, his attempt is thwarted by Katakuri.
Jinbe steps in and saves Luffy from Katakuri's clutches. He then confronts Big Mom and declares his intention to leave her crew and join the Straw Hats. Big Mom then attempts to take Jinbe's lifespan, but his lack of fear towards her causes her powers to have no effect. As Big Mom attacks Jinbe in a fit of rage, Brook destroys the photo of Carmel.","About three and a half hours ago, Luffy had requested for Bege to put a mirror inside the cake for him to enter the wedding through. Bege initially resisted, but Luffy insisted on entering in a fun way before noting that Brûlée once turned animals into duplicates of his crewmates, intending on using that to his advantage. In the present, multiple duplicates of Luffy create chaos across the wedding venue, and Morgans excitedly takes pictures of the notorious pirate's entrance. The wedding cake starts to collapse, and Sanji uses Sky Walk to fly a weeping Pudding away. Smoothie confronts Mont-d'Or, having been led to believe by Opera that Luffy had been killed. Mont-d'Or curses Opera for lying to protect himself, and nearby, Big Mom walks toward her collapsing cake furious and on the verge of a breakdown. Streusen attempts to stop her, but her eyes change color as she orders three cooks to bring her a new wedding cake. With them being unable to do so, Morgans notes that Big Mom will perform ""Soul Pocus"". The atmosphere around Big Mom and the cooks changes dramatically as she gives them the choice to bring another wedding cake or surrender their lives. The cooks fear for their lives, which causes wisps of their lifespan to leave their body, and as they run away, Big Mom pulls out their lifespans.
Inside the Mirro-World, all of the Luffy duplicates have been unleashed and so Jinbe and Pedro go to back up Luffy while Nami, Chopper, and Carrot go to help Sanji, leaving Caesar alone with Brûlée. Outside, Big Mom angrily turns her attention to Luffy as he and his duplicates run circles around her and her crew, asking aloud who the real one is. Bege is initially confident that Luffy will not divulge his location, but is completely flabbergasted as Luffy immediately identifies himself. An enraged Big Mom prepares to attack him with Zeus and Prometheus, and when he sees the Mother Carmel portrait, Luffy races toward it. However, as he activates Gear 2 and prepares to destroy it, he is suddenly hit by a massive tendril of a sticky substance coated in Armament Haki. The tendril is revealed to be Katakuri's leg, and Big Mom is initially mad at her son for interfering in her fight. However, Katakuri reveals that he foresaw Luffy destroying the portrait, shocking everyone in the venue, and Bege gets worried about the plan being foiled.
With Luffy unable to escape the substance, Katakuri slams him towards the ground, but Jinbe comes in and launches a blast of tea that frees Luffy. Jinbe reveals to Luffy that Katakuri ate the Mochi Mochi no Mi, a ""special Paramecia"" Devil Fruit allowing him to control mochi. Big Mom notices Jinbe, and he addresses her, saying that he told the Straw Hats about the Carmel portrait. He then makes his official request to leave the Big Mom Pirates so he can join the Straw Hats, and Big Mom asks if he will pay the price; he agrees, but on the condition that no one else is harmed. Big Mom then asks if he wants to stay or give up his lifespan, and Jinbe chooses to give up his lifespan. However, as Big Mom begins Soul Pocus again, she is unable to pull out Jinbe's lifespan due to him not fearing for his life. Jinbe says that he cannot be afraid of an Emperor if he is a member of the future Pirate King's crew, and decides to return the sake cup that had formed their bond in order to part ways with Big Mom. However, Big Mom steps on the cup and remarks that she and Jinbe are now enemies, causing her to unleash a powerful attack with Prometheus. However, in the midst of the fiery explosion, Brook, who had disguised himself as Luffy and jumped out of the cake with the other duplicates, walks up to the Carmel portrait and smashes it with a hammer.","Monkey D.

Despite Katakuri's attempt to stop Luffy, the latter manages to show Carmel's broken picture to Big Mom. She starts screaming and incapacitates her family and crew, allowing Sanji to free his family. With Big Mom vulnerable, Bege, Vito, and Gotti prepare to assassinate her.","With Perospero and the Big Mom Pirates about to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family, Sanji runs toward them. Nusstorte leaps to strike him with his sword, but Sanji blocks it. Laurin and Dosmarche then attack, and Sanji works to get around them as well. However, he is then confronted by Daifuku again. Outside the venue, Caesar exits the Mirro-World with Brûlée in tow. Brûlée pleads to not let her crewmates see her face so they do not kill her, but Caesar quiets her and looks forward to completing the mission and getting his heart back. He looks over the venue wall, and sees the Carmel portrait broken, and so is unsure why Big Mom is not shrieking right now.
Inside, Luffy runs toward Big Mom to show her the broken portrait, and Katakuri chases after him. Bege, Jinbe, and Pedro stand in Katakuri's way, and Bege shoots rapidly at the Sweet Commander. Katakuri uses his Devil Fruit power to turn his body into mochi and let the bullets pass through him, and the other Big Mom Pirates are taken aback by Bege's display of betrayal. They shoot at Luffy, but his rubber body deflects the bullets. Luffy prepares to put the portrait shards in front of Big Mom, but his arms are grabbed by Oven, who heats them up with his Devil Fruit. Luffy drops the portrait pieces and Oven picks them up, but Brook then attacks and freezes Oven solid. He gives the pieces to Luffy as Oven heats his way out of his encasement, and Brook faces Oven while Luffy keeps running. Meanwhile, Katakuri avoids another round of Bege's bullets before racing toward Luffy again, and as he runs, he tells Perospero to hurry and kill the Vinsmokes. Perospero taunts Judge, who can only weep over the absence of their Raid Suits. Sanji races toward his family, but Daifuku summons his genie to attack. Sanji blocks its first strike, and as he runs, Reiju silently expresses her happiness at Sanji being kind enough to try to rescue them, even though she considers them worthless. However, the genie catches up to Sanji again and pins him to the ground, and Sanji cannot do anything except shout at his family to run while Reiju silently thanks him and accepts her fate.
Katakuri continues chasing Luffy, covering Bege's gun with mochi before stretching a mochi leg towards Luffy. Pedro cuts the mochi leg, and Jinbe comes in and uses Fish-Man Karate to throw a punch at Katakuri, but the Sweet Commander turns most of his body into mochi and dodges the strike. He then successfully catches up to Luffy and pins him to the ground with mochi, but as he foresees, this is insufficient as Luffy stretches his arms up to Big Mom's face, allowing her to see the broken portrait. Big Mom takes the shards and puts them together, realizing that her prized portrait of Carmel is broken. This causes her to unleash a devastating scream that overwhelms everyone in the venue, and only the enemy alliance members are able to move around thanks to their earplugs. As Daifuku recoils and his genie disappears, Sanji breaks free and runs toward his family, activating Diable Jambe and performing a spinning kick into the top of the table. This causes Perospero's candy to shatter, freeing the Vinsmokes as Chopper gives them earplugs while Carrot and Nami give them their Raid Suits. Elsewhere, Vito and Gotti come out of Bege's body with their KX Launchers at the ready, and Smoothie cries out in shock in anger as she sees what they intend to do.

Episode 836,Mom's Secret - The Giant's Island Elbaf and a Little Monster,"May 13, 2018","A flashback begins, showing 63 years ago when Linlin was five years old. Her parents left her at Elbaf and she met Carmel, a woman who saved some Giant Warrior Pirates from execution after Dorry and Brogy began their duel on Little Garden. Carmel ran an orphanage called the Sheep's House and she took Linlin in.
The Elbaf village prepares for the Winter Solstice Festival. The villagers and the Sheep's House children feast on semla prior to the twelve-day fast. On the seventh day of the fast, Linlin lost control and goes on a rampage for semla.","As Big Mom screams, she calls out to Mother Carmel and asks where she went to. A flashback starts, showing Big Mom’s past 63 years ago when she was five years old. Linlin and her parents arrived at Elbaf's shore on a ship. Linlin’s parents tell her to stay on the island and promise Linlin that they will return and reward her with sweets if she waits for them. Linlin replies that she will stay and wait for them and tells them goodbye as they leave Linlin alone on the island. Linlin’s mother cries and her father says that it is best for them to leave Linlin on the island after all the damage she has caused around them and hopes that Mother Carmel will save her since he knows she lives on Elbaf. At the shore, Linlin sits down and waits for her parents to return but the day goes by and her parents do not come, causing Linlin to ask why they are not coming like they promised.
A century ago, there was a pirate crew of giants called the Giant Warrior Pirates who caused a lot of havoc around the seas and burnt countless cities. One day, the Giant Warrior Pirates lost their two captains when they began their duel on Little Garden. Not long after, several members of the giant crew were caught by the Marines and were about to be executed. However, a young Carmel, known as “Sister Carmel” at the time, steps in and tells the Marines to stop the execution. Carmel explains that if they were executed, the warriors of Elbaf will form an army to seek revenge against humans and tells the Marines to forgive them. A beam of light flashes on Carmel and she says that she will lead the giants into forming a world where all races coexist in great harmony. Eventually, Carmel receives the name “Mother” and she opens an orphanage called the Sheep's House, where she accepts children of all races who did not have a place to go while settling on Elbaf, hoping to build a bridge of friendship between humans and giants.
37 years later, Mother Carmel meets the five-year old Linlin for the first time, promising that she will be in good hands until her parents return and tells Linlin that she will make good friends while in the orphanage. Because Linlin was always big, Elbaf was the first place she has been where people, houses, and other things fit her size, which made Linlin comfortable staying while in Elbaf. One day, Linlin spots a bear and a wolf fighting, knocking them both out and tells them that fighting is not good. Linlin is later spotted crying by Carmel and Linlin explains that she wanted a wolf and a bear to stop fighting and become friends so she decides to put them in the same cage in hopes that the bear and wolf would get along, but the bear ended up eating the wolf causing Linlin to hit it. Carmel asks how many times she hit the bear and Linlin replies that she hit the bear only once, causing Carmel to be shocked that Linlin was even able to kill the bear with one blow. Carmel tells Linlin that it is okay because she only wanted them to be friends to which Linlin finally formed a bond with Mother Carmel. To Linlin, Carmel was the first person who truly understood her. At this moment, the orphans started to talk about how Linlin was a dangerous person, able to kill a bear with one blow and even caused a giant an injury after she tried to hit a mosquito on him, breaking several of his bones. Linlin is spotted by Carmel twice, once trying to get rid of a longarm orphan’s extra elbow joints and a fish-man orphan’s fins. Carmel informs her that it was normal for them to look like that because of each of them belonging to a specific race that makes them carry those traits. Carmel pardoned her actions and told all the orphans to forgive her and that she is a nice child.
Ten months later, Oimo and Kashii discussed about the ongoing duel between their former captains, Dorry and Brogy, and decided to go check on them in ten years. Linlin chases after a giant girl named Gerd and is asked by Kashii if they finished with the preparations. Linlin asks what the preparations were for and Gerd tells her that in Elbaf, they go fasting for 12 days before the Winter Solstice Festival. Linlin was surprised on the thought of not eating for 12 days and says that she will be hungry. Gerd replies that if she fast, the festival will be enjoyable. Meanwhile, a young Hajrudin is seen training with an Elbaf warrior named Raideen. There, the two former captains of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Jarul and Jorul commends Raideen for his warrior spirit, causing Hajrudin to be grateful for their coming. Kashii asks why they came and Jorul replies that they will gather all the orphans together so everybody can eat semla. Linlin asks what semla is and Gerd replies that it is a very delicious sweet, much to Linlin’s excitement, and explains that before they fast, they would get enough nutrition by eating semla. Gerd gives a description of semla to Linlin while both eventually drool over the thought of eating semla. Eventually, everyone gathers together in a banquet, ready to eat the semla with Jorul and Jarul thanking the sun for the birth of Loki, Goldberg, and Road as well as the growth of the children. As there were already a large quantity of semla made, everyone began to make their thanks and eat. Linlin eats semla and instantly fell in love with it, eating a huge quantity of semla very fast until she was stopped by two giants forcing her not to eat too fast as there would not be enough semla for other people to eat and told her not to forget to thank the sun. Linlin insist that she must eat semla and pushes the two giants away to eat the remaining semla on the plate and says that they were delicious. Three days have passed since the fasting started, and Linlin tells Carmel she is starved to which Carmel replies that fighting through the severe winter will lead the sun to shine down and it should be better for them to wait until the festival approaches. Days 4 and 5 passes and Linlin still feels very hungry but listens to Carmel to wait for the festival to begin. Day 6, Linlin thinks about semla and says she wants to eat it. On Day 7, Gerd rushes to Mother Carmel in a panic and reveals that Linlin was rampaging in the village. There, Linlin is wreaking havoc screaming for semla. As everyone is in shock of what Linlin did, Jorul walks in and says she has no right to thank the sun and her actions are unforgivable, stating that she is a god of disaster within a child’s body. He draws his sword out to strike her down with Carmel telling him to stop as Linlin calls out for semla.","Monkey D.

Linlin's rampage finally stopped when the giants gave her the semla. Jarul prepared to avenge Jorul, but Carmel begged him to spare Linlin, saying that she would leave Elbaf with her.
Jorul died and this incident earned Linlin the hatred of the giants. Carmel and the children of the Sheep's House moved to a different island. Carmel had a secret meeting with Cipher Pol, negotiating on selling Linlin to the World Government. The Sheep's House children later celebrated Linlin's sixth birthday. After feasting on some sweets, Linlin discovered that Carmel and the other orphans disappeared.","63 years ago on Elbaf, Jorul brought his sword down on Linlin, only for her to break it with her arm and flip the giant over, greatly injuring him. As other giants went to try subduing Linlin, Carmel told them to get the semla they had stored, and she went up to the flames engulfing Elbaf Village. Using her Devil Fruit powers, Carmel gave life to the flames and condensed them into a small sun, which she named Pandora. The giants stared in awe at Carmel's seeming miracle, and Linlin went to sleep after fulfilling her semla craving. Jorul urged the giants to retaliate against Linlin, saying to not think of her as a child, and Jarul prepared to plunge his sword into Linlin. Carmel stood in his way and pleaded for forgiveness, and Jarul refused, saying Jorul would die from his injuries due to his advanced age. Carmel offered to leave Elbaf with Linlin, and Jarul reluctantly accepted her offer despite Hajrudin wanting Linlin dead. The next morning, Linlin went to Jorul's grave with the rest of the Sheep's House children, and to the giants' surprise, she had no memory of how he died.
Carmel took her wards to another island, where the giants built a new Sheep's House for them. Life resumed as normal for Linlin and the other kids, and one day, Carmel said she would be away for a bit to buy groceries. However, she instead went to a government ship to converse with Cipher Pol agents. It had been believed that Carmel had put the children of the Sheep's House into foster homes, but in reality, she was an Underworld child trafficker who sold children to become soldiers in the Marines or Cipher Pol. Her salvation of the Giant Warrior Pirates had been an act as well that resulted in giants like John Giant joining the Marines. Carmel put Linlin up for sale at a high price, promising that she would be a powerful tool for the Marines or Cipher Pol. She decided to retire after this transaction was completed, and returned to the Sheep's House, planning to celebrate Linlin's birthday the next day before handing over the children to Cipher Pol.
The next day, Carmel and the Sheep's House children presented Linlin with a croquembouche made of semla for her sixth birthday. Linlin became overjoyed as she gorged on the semla, and the friends she had made cheered her on. She became so happy that tears clouded her eyes, and noted that she took a few bites out of the table in the process, but when she finished eating, she opened her eyes to see Carmel, the other children, and the table no longer there, with only various scraps and parts of Carmel's clothing remaining. She looked around for them, but could not find them, and cried in despair as night fell. In the present, Big Mom screams over the despair of Carmel's disappearance, wanting desperately to know where she went all those years ago.","Jorul (flashback), Charlotte Linlin, Gerd (flashback), Carmel (flashback), Hajrudin (flashback), Kashii (flashback), Oimo (flashback), Pandora (flashback), Jarul (flashback), Raideen (flashback), Napoleon, Charlotte Oven, Charlotte Katakuri, Charlotte Smoothie, Gotti, Vito, Capone Bege, Monkey D.

One of the witnesses was an Elbaf giant, who quickly fled back to Elbaf to tell the other giants what he saw. The other witness was Streusen, who decided to take advantage of Linlin's potential. Streusen befriended Linlin and they began creating Linlin's ideal country.
Back in the present, Bege, Vito, and Gotti fire their KX Launchers. However, their assassination attempt ends in failure as Big Mom's scream destroys the rockets before they could reach her. Caesar Clown brings in the escape mirror, but it is shattered by Big Mom's scream. Katakuri creates earplugs for his family and crew and the Big Mom Pirates proceed to surround the alliance.","In the present day, Big Mom cries over Carmel's disappearance 63 years ago. Unbeknownst to her, there were two people who witnessed her disappearance that day. One was a giant from Elbaf who came to check on the Sheep's House, and when he saw what happened, he became horrified and ran away. He returned to Elbaf and told the other giants about what happened, causing them to revile Linlin even more. The other witness was a cook and former pirate named Streusen, who could turn inanimate objects into food with the Kuku Kuku no Mi. Streusen was amused by what he saw, and he decided to take advantage of Linlin. He approached her, offering to feed her if she accompanied him and made her a feast to eat.
In the present, Bege, Vito, and Gotti shoot their KX Launchers at Big Mom, and as she screams, Big Mom recalls the dream of wanting to create a utopia where all races live in harmony. Before Carmel disappeared, she had told Linlin and the other children about her dream for all races to see eye to eye, and Linlin interpreted this as making everyone else as large as her. After the disappearance, she told Streusen about this dream, and the cook offered to help make the island they were on into her utopia. Linlin still mourned over Carmel, and tried recreating the motions she had made to give life to objects. To her surprise, she was now able to do this as well and gave life to several flowers, trees, and pieces of ground, which impressed Streusen. Later, some Marines came onto the island to search for Carmel and the children she was going to sell when they encountered Linlin's homies. They were shocked by the living objects and tried to shoot them when they encountered Linlin. Angered at their actions, Linlin hit and threw the Marines with devastating power, to Streusen's delight. They later set off to sea, where Linlin easily destroyed and took over several islands. She received a bounty of 50,000,000 despite only being a child, and the Cipher Pol marked her as a dangerous future threat. Not very long afterwards, she was eating sweets in a castle she had attacked when she was confronted by Marines. She quickly overpowered them with the help of her new homies Zeus and Prometheus, and her bounty grew to 500,000,000 as she continued conquering islands with ease in order to impose her dream upon them, attacking people who did not go along with her wishes.
In the present, Big Mom grows frustrated at how people have always resisted her and Carmel's dream, and before the Fire Tank Pirates' shots can hit her, they are destroyed by her angry screams. Aghast at their failure, Bege, Vito, and Gotti run away, while Katakuri manages to put mochi earplugs in his ears. With his composure regained, he makes earplugs for his crewmates, allowing them to move around again.

Yonji uses Winch Green to catch and crush two boulders thrown at him, and Judge creates a whirlwind with his spear that blows Tablet, Mascarpone, and Joscarpone away. Basskarte then launches fireballs at the family, but Ichiji uses Sparking Red to blow away the flames with an explosion. When Perospero attacks the family with a candy wave, Ichiji punches him aside as Niji attacks Oven with an electric kick, freeing Chopper. Yonji confronts Saint-Marc, and easily overwhelms the large pirate with his strength as he spins him around before slamming him into Daifuku's genie, making it release Carrot. Yonji then subdues the genie by slamming his outstretched hand into the back of its head. Reiju kicks Smoothie in the arm, infecting the Sweet Commander with poison and forcing her to let go of Nami. As Nami falls a great distance toward the ground, she is caught by Sanji, who brings her to Bege. Luffy hits Dacquoise, Laurin, and another Big Mom Pirate away from Bege's entrance, and Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Carrot, and the Vinsmokes successfully make it into the fortress.
Bege then turns his attention to Big Mom, who is still weakened due to her breakdown. He tries shooting at her with his cannons, but Perospero blocks the shots with a candy wall. Bege then brings out tank treads and rolls toward Big Mom, planning to shoot her with all the ammunition he has. However, Katakuri plugs up the cannons with mochi, which causes them to explode. Refusing to give up, Bege rolls toward Big Mom again in an attempt to run her over, only for Perospero to hold him in place with his candy entrapments. Bege then declares the plan to assassinate Big Mom as a failure, and tells his crewmates and allies that they will have to fight under siege from the Big Mom Pirates.","Capone Bege, Monkey D.

Episode 840,Cutting the Father-Son Relationship - Sanji and Judge,"June 10, 2018","The alliance and the Vinsmoke Family take shelter inside Bege's fortress. However, Big Mom regains her senses and begins attacking the fortress.
Bege comes up with a plan to escape. He will return to human form with the alliance still inside him and have Caesar fly him out of the venue.
Judge then asks Sanji why he saved his family. Sanji replies that he did it to honor Zeff before disowning Judge. After promising to never interfere in Sanji's life nor go near East Blue again, Judge volunteers to help the alliance escape. As Bege deactivates his Big Father form, the Vinsmokes face the Big Mom Pirates in battle.","The Big Mom Pirates besiege Bege as his Big Father form continues to be trapped, and Smoothie wrings out the poison that Reiju attacked her with. Katakuri confronts Brûlée about her role in the enemy alliance, and she assures him in panic that she was a victim. Meanwhile, Bege manifests inside his body and notes that this was the first time one of his assassination plots failed. He says that they do not have much time to think of a way out, and immediately afterwards, Big Mom stops screaming and regains her senses. After Katakuri tells her about Bege's betrayal, she flies into a rage and begins attacking him. Bege reveals that since the Big Father fortress is his body, he will die if it is destroyed and everyone inside him will be expelled right in front of the Big Mom Pirates lying in wait. This is soon demonstrated when Big Mom hits Bege and destroys stone that could normally resist cannon fire, and inside, Bege takes injuries and writhes in pain from the damage. Big Mom climbs on Bege, peering through a window and telling him and Luffy to come out.
The Fire Tank Pirates become panicked as they try thinking of ways to help Bege, and Chiffon rushes to the window to plead for Big Mom to spare his life. However, Big Mom becomes enraged upon seeing her due to being reminded of her twin Lola, and Big Mom believes she conspired with Bege as she attempts to attack her. Luffy pulls Chiffon out of harm's way, and decides to go out and attack Big Mom. His crewmates stop him, reminding him that they did not come to fight, but Luffy wants to help Bege. Bege states that he does not care if the crews he allied with perish during this, but will continue protecting them in order to keep his family and crew safe. He then reveals his plan to escape. His exterior body will return to normal, with everyone remaining inside, and Caesar will come out and fly him to the coast of Whole Cake Island. However, Caesar protests this idea, believing that the Big Mom Pirates would easily kill him despite his Logia powers.
Meanwhile, Judge asks Sanji why he decided to save him and his family. Sanji replied that his real father would be disappointed to hear that he left his blood family to die out of petty vengeance, even though they hid him away in a cell to erase his existence as a child. Remembering how Judge told him to never claim to be his child before he escaped to East Blue, Sanji walks up to him, grabs him by the neck, and disowns him as his father. Judge accepts this, and agrees to never go after him or the East Blue in the future. Meanwhile, the others are in a frenzy as Bege's fortifications become very weak and Caesar still refuses to follow the plan. The Vinsmokes then go up to Bege, offering to head out and defend him and Caesar from the Big Mom Pirates. They head toward the gate, and Caesar is coerced to go along as Bege threatens his heart, and as Bege returns to his normal form, the Vinsmokes and Caesar fly out toward Big Mom.","Charlotte Linlin, Napoleon, Charlotte Katakuri, Charlotte Oven, Charlotte Smoothie, Charlotte Daifuku, Pandaman, Charlotte Perospero, Charlotte Brûlée, Charlotte Nusstorte, Charlotte Citron, Charlotte Mont-d'Or, Charlotte Amande, Charlotte Basskarte, Capone Bege, Charlotte Chiffon, Capone Pez, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 841,Escape From the Tea Party! Luffy vs. Big Mom,"June 17, 2018","As Caesar carries Bege out of the venue, the Vinsmoke Family covers for them. During the scuffle, Big Mom knocks down Reiju, prompting Luffy and Sanji to leave Bege's body to defend her as Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji repel any Big Mom Pirate who goes after Caesar.
Luffy briefly clashes with Big Mom before retreating. As Big Mom starts chasing Luffy's group, Judge battles Big Mom but is quickly defeated.","After Bege reverts back to his normal body and Caesar and Germa 66 emerge from it, Bege and Caesar are left out in the open, and the Big Mom Pirates quickly take the opportunity to shoot at them mercilessly. However, Ichiji, Niji, Yonji, and Reiju shield them from the bullets. Caesar then grabs Bege and flies off with Germa accompanying him, and Katakuri foresees that they are trying to fly over the wall and escape from the wedding venue. Judge attacks Katakuri but misses, and the Big Mom Pirates leap up to attack their enemies. However, Big Mom stops them as she throws Prometheus toward the enemy pirates. Reiju takes the brunt of the blast, and is eventually overwhelmed and falls onto the ground. Luffy wants to leave Bege to help Reiju, but his crewmates hold him back. Mascarpone and Joscarpone attempt to attack her while she is down, but Reiju quickly responds by kicking them in the necks and poisoning them. Smoothie comes to remove the poison from her siblings, while Big Mom prepares to attack Reiju with Zeus. However, both Luffy and Sanji leap out of Bege and block the attack, and both of them are annoyed that the other came with them.
Nami, Chopper, and Brook are aghast at Luffy and Sanji's action, and after the clash, Sanji quickly grabs Luffy and they and Reiju run away from Big Mom. She calls out to Luffy, reminding him that he had promised to defeat her and wondering why he is running away. In response for her taunts, Luffy goes back to punch her once, despite Sanji's pleas. He activates Gear 4 and attacks Big Mom with Kong Gun, saying that he would become Pirate King, but she counters by simply coating her arms in Armament Haki. Meanwhile, the Big Mom Pirates attempt to shoot Caesar in the air, but their bullets are again blocked by Germa. Vito assures the Straw Hats that his idols the Germa will protect them, and when High-Fat and Noisette leap up to attack, Niji beats them away with Dengeki Blue. Mobile, Laurin, and Mash then move to attack, but Yonji grabs the latter two and throws them into Mobile, sending them crashing into the ground. Dacquoise, Zuccotto, and Kato then attack, but Ichiji easily deals with them. He then flies toward Dacquoise and dodges his shots before punching him in the chest with Sparking Red, forcing him back onto the ground. As Germa protects him and his allies, Vito gazes at them in awe.
The Big Mom Pirates' assault continues as Oven leaps up right in front of Caesar and heats up his fists. However, Yonji intercepts the attack, allowing Caesar to fly away. Oven makes his fists too hot for Yonji to handle, forcing Yonji to separate from him as they confront each other. Daifuku then summons his genie to confront Caesar, but Niji steps in. Niji meets the genie's halberd with a kick, and their massive clash causes the genie to dissipate. Smoothie then jumps up, preparing to squeeze Caesar and Bege, but she is stopped by Ichiji. The two dodge each others' strikes, and Smoothie grabs Ichiji's leg as he attempts to fly away, but he manages to increase his jet power enough to escape her grasp. The Big Mom Pirates continue their pursuit, and Bege's subordinates attempt to shoot them from inside his body, but Judge arrives to take them down. Caesar gets very close to the wall and freedom, but Perospero erects a candy wall that converges down on him. However, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji come rushing in and combine their abilities in an attack on the wall that completely shatters it, and the Straw Hats cheer on Caesar as he nears the home stretch.
Meanwhile, Lu Feld is relieved that the Tamatebako landed on a ledge of the Whole Cake Chateau only a short distance below. He prepares to go get it, when he is confronted by Stussy. During this encounter, the frosting under Feld gives way, causing him to fall onto the ledge where the Tamatebako is. He excitedly goes to open it, only to be shot by Stussy's Tobu Shigan; being revealed to be an undercover CP0 agent, she declares that the Tamatebako will go to the World Government. She makes sure that Morgans, who is spying on this exchange, will blame the theft on Feld in his newspaper in exchange for getting to see its contents. However, Feld's unconscious body leans on the Tamatebako and pushes it off the Chateau, to Stussy and Morgans' shock. Meanwhile, Luffy declares he will defeat Big Mom after he takes down Kaidou as he attacks Big Mom with a two-armed strike. Big Mom manages to repel him, and her blow causes Luffy to deactivate Gear 4, forcing Sanji to grab him and run away. Big Mom says that Luffy beating Kaidou is impossible, but he will not even get the chance to try because he will not escape from her territory. As she races toward Luffy, Judge comes flying in and attacks her, expressing his shame over the fact that he was duped in his quest to restore the glory days of Germa. However, Big Mom catches his spear in her teeth and destroys it. Judge unsuccessfully tries attacking her again, and she grabs him, saying that he can be assured she will use his scientific technology to bring peace to the world. She then uses Zeus to strike him with a massive thunderbolt.","Charlotte Linlin, Napoleon, Charlotte Amande, Charlotte Compote, Charlotte Nusstorte, Vinsmoke Ichiji, Charlotte High-Fat, Vinsmoke Niji, Charlotte Mozart, Charlotte Marnier, Vinsmoke Reiju, Caesar Clown, Vinsmoke Judge, Capone Bege, Vinsmoke Yonji, Charlotte Poire, Charlotte Mash, Charlotte Galette, Charlotte Dosmarche, Charlotte Smoothie, Charlotte Mont-d'Or, Charlotte Angel, Charlotte Saint-Marc, Charlotte Oven, Charlotte Katakuri, Charlotte Perospero, Charlotte Noisette, Charlotte Zuccotto, Charlotte Laurin, Charlotte Dacquoise, Charlotte Kato, Charlotte Citron, Charlotte Cinnamon, Charlotte Decuplets, Prometheus, Charlotte Joscarpone, Charlotte Mascarpone, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

However, Smoothie punches her into some rubble and squeezes out the poison again. Galette then binds Sanji, Reiju, and Luffy in place, allowing the Big Mom Pirates to attack and subdue them. Ichiji is unable to land a hit on Katakuri, and the Sweet Commander grabs him by the arm and knees him. Ichiji states that he will put his own life on the line to accomplish his task of keeping the Big Mom Pirates at bay, and uses Sparking Red to build up energy and unleash a devastating explosion that engulfs the two of them.

Luffy prepares to have the crew activate Coup de Burst, but Katakuri still remains on the ship. He asks why everyone is so heated up, and Carrot activates Electro as she leaps at him in a rage. As she attacks, she remembers training in swordsmanship with Shishilian on Zou. Shishilian was constantly overpowering her when Pedro came in and offered to train Carrot with a weapon that would suit her better. He gave her a paw-shaped gauntlet to wear on her hand and trained her, to much greater success. Later, they sat on top of the Whale tree, and Carrot thanked Pedro for helping her to become stronger than she had ever imagined. He told her to be constantly prepared, as everyone would have their turn in life to act and so her turn would come as well. In the present, however, Katakuri manages to dodge all of Carrot's strikes before pinning her to the ground with his foot, and Carrot sheds a tear over her failure to live up to Pedro's instructions.
Luffy then steps in to fight Katakuri, and after Katakuri dodges his first wave of strikes, Luffy attacks with Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun. Katakuri blocks the giant punch with a wall of mochi, but Luffy then unclenches his fist and wraps his fingers around Katakuri's body, trapping him. As Nami builds up the cola energy for Coup de Burst, Chopper and Brook go to tie the Shark Submerge III to the Sunny. However, they see Big Mom heading toward the ship, unharmed by the explosion, and go into a frenzy to get the Submerge tied into place. Amande's fleet of Tartes fires a round of cannonballs at the Sunny, but misses as the Coup de Burst preparation is completed. However, right before it can be activated, Big Mom grabs the Sunny's stern and tips the ship backward, causing one of the cola barrels to fall out of the Sunny's engine.
After realizing what has happened, Nami prepares to go restore the engine while Chopper and Brook intercept the next rounds of cannonballs fired by Amande's fleet. Jinbe wants to join them, but Nami tells him to man the helm while she goes below deck, and she gives him a tone dial from Franky to tell him how to activate Coup de Burst. Meanwhile, to Katakuri's horror, Brûlée appears in the mirror behind Luffy to try to help, and Luffy then uses his other arm to grab onto her. As Big Mom starts taking bites out of the Sunny, the Straw Hats see in shock that Perospero is alive. Perospero emerges from the smoke with his right arm missing, and he curses Pedro for destroying his candy armor. Nami hurriedly goes below deck, where she reloads the barrel of cola that had been knocked out of place. With one arm grabbing Katakuri and one arm grabbing Brûlée, Luffy tells his crew that he will leave the rest to them and will return to them later. Following Franky's instructions, Jinbe waits for the cola's energy to build up, and upon completion, he pulls the lever to activate Coup de Burst. The blast hits Big Mom from point-blank range, and the Sunny is sent flying over Amande's fleet and far into the distance. As they are in the air, however, the Straw Hats look and see no trace of Luffy or Katakuri. Luffy pulls himself and Katakuri through the Sunny's mirror into the Mirro-World, and Luffy breaks the mirror leading there as he faces Katakuri. Katakuri states that Luffy is no match for him and will die here, but Luffy affirms that he will defeat the Sweet Commander and return to the Sunny.","Nami, Carrot, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Sanji, Pudding, and Chiffon approach Cacao Island.","Luffy confronts Katakuri in the Mirro-World, and although the Sweet Commander states that Luffy's recklessness has made him very dangerous to the Big Mom Pirates, Luffy is no match for him in combat. Katakuri's subordinates affirm this, stating that his bounty is greater than 1,000,000,000 and he is the strongest of the Three Sweet Commanders. Luffy then attacks Katakuri, but Katakuri easily dodges all the attacks and hits Luffy with his advanced Observation Haki. Eventually, Luffy attacks Katakuri with rapid punches, but instead of moving out of the way, Katakuri creates mochi tendrils out of his back that he fashions into fists, and he perfectly counters all of Luffy's punches with the mochi fists. After Luffy ceases his attack, Katakuri proceeds to pummel him with the fists, and mercilessly beats him to the point of pushing him into the wall and creating a crater. Katakuri says that he is superior to Luffy in everything, and with Gear 2 activated, Luffy attempts to assault Katakuri again. However, Katakuri manages to keep up with Luffy while in Gear 2 and eventually outpaces him to kick him into the wall. Katakuri then foresees that Luffy will show him his power next as Luffy bites into his thumb.
Meanwhile, the Thousand Sunny falls back to the sea, far away from Whole Cake Island. The crew briefly searches for Luffy, but deduces that he must have gone to the Mirro-World. Brook and Chopper then wonder where Pedro is, and Nami explains to them about Pedro's sacrifice as it starts to rain. The three of them and Carrot get emotional and weep, but Jinbe tells them to not get upset. This angers Brook, but Jinbe tells them that Pedro had been preparing to sacrifice himself, and that his sacrifice was what allowed them to escape the Big Mom Pirates' onslaught on Whole Cake Island. Since they are still in Totto Land and the Big Mom Pirates would soon pursue them again, they will need to get working and be vigilant in order to escape and honor Pedro's goal. This spurs Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Carrot into action, and they quickly get in position to aid in their voyage. However, Carrot soon spots the Big Mom Pirates' fleet coming after them, and it is accompanied by Big Mom herself, who is walking on a candy sea slug created by Perospero. Perospero creates a prosthetic right arm out of candy, but curses Pedro since the candy arm will melt whenever he drinks tea. Meanwhile, Zeus and Prometheus go to the coast of Whole Cake Island to find no one there, and the two homies are frustrated and hungry.
Elsewhere, as Sanji, Chiffon, Pudding, and Nitro ride Rabiyan toward Cacao Island, Sanji finds out that Lola is a master chocolatier. Chiffon reveals that Lola was the Minister of Chocolate who governed over Cacao Island before she ran away, and the position has not been filled since then since the best candidate, Pudding, refuses to take Lola's spot. Pudding is currently lying down in the rolled-up front of Rabiyan, and refuses to come out because she does not want to be seen with Sanji in her wedding dress. Down in the sea below, Pound is sailing away when he sees Chiffon up above.

With Brûlée awake again, the Big Mom Pirates prepare to attack the Thousand Sunny.","After sparring with speed, Katakuri predicts that Luffy will attack him with power next as Luffy activates his Elephant Gun. However, his giant fist is met by Katakuri's even bigger mochi fist, and he is slammed into the wall. Katakuri's men cheer as Luffy falls to the ground, but Luffy quickly recovers and immediately tries attacking again with Grizzly Magnum. However, Katakuri creates two bigger fists just as easily and overwhelms Luffy again. During their clash, Katakuri transforms the fists back into mochi and covers Luffy's arms with it, allowing him to spin Luffy around. Luffy manages to slip out of the mochi and tries to attack Katakuri with Gigant Axe, but Katakuri dodges the attack as he creates an even bigger foot out of mochi and pounds Luffy into the ground. Luffy is left lying in a crater after the attack, and Katakuri says he sees no victory in Luffy's future, with his men believing Luffy to already be defeated.
Meanwhile, Pudding puts handcuffs on Chiffon in order to pass her off as a prisoner, and manages to tell Sanji to hide in Rabiyan's fold. The group arrives at Cacao Island, and Pudding assures the concerned citizens that Chiffon was not a key member of her husband Capone Bege's plan to assassinate Big Mom. Some animals sense Sanji's presence, but Pudding manages to press on ahead to keep him hidden. The Choco Police officer takes her to the Sweets Factory, and they discuss the wedding and Big Mom's rampage. The officer states that Whole Cake Island's 31 finest head chefs have been gathered to help make the cake, and these chefs step out, ready to get to work.
The WCI 31 introduce themselves to Pudding's group, and she instructs the citizens outside to not peek inside the Sweets Factory at any time. She then has each of the chefs meet with her alone, and she manipulates their memories to make them think the wedding between her and Sanji was successful and that the cake was ruined by the weather. Meanwhile, Sanji shows Chiffon his blueprints for the cake, and she is taken aback at how he perfectly remembered all the ingredients through smell alone. Pudding then joins them, and she reveals what she did to the chefs. Sanji then gives orders to them, telling Chiffon to make the chiffon cake and Pudding to make the chocolate, and he will make the secret ingredient that he says will unlock true happiness. They will have a short two hours and 40 minutes to bake the cake, and will decorate it after taking it out to sea, with the intention of crossing paths with Big Mom and the Straw Hat Pirates between Cacao and Whole Cake Island and feeding her there. The WCI 31 does not think that they can cook in that short of a timespan, but Chiffon intimidates them into action as the group begins working.
In the Mirro-World, Katakuri receives a call from Perospero, who reveals to him that the Straw Hats escaped from their blockade on Whole Cake Island, but they are catching up to the crew through the water. He asks about Katakuri's fight with Luffy, and Katakuri says that he is just about to finish the pirate off. Luffy regains consciousness and overhears Perospero mocking Pedro's sacrifice and how it was in vain. Perospero tells Luffy that he will die in vain as well before the call ends, and as he starts talking to Brûlée, Katakuri realizes that Luffy has gotten up. Luffy charges at Katakuri and attacks him with Elephant Gatling, but an annoyed Katakuri easily dodges it before countering it with a bigger mochi fist, sending Luffy crashing into the wall again. Saying that he is stronger than Luffy in every aspect, Katakuri pummels the pirate with dozens of mochi fists, leaving him lying submissively on the ground. Katakuri tells Brûlée to take the soldiers and attack the Thousand Sunny, and Mascarpone and Joscarpone bring in a mirror leading to it.

However, Katakuri eventually regains his focus, and when Luffy attacks him, he confirms that Luffy's understanding of his abilities is correct as he foresees where the attacks will land, transforms the body parts that will be attacked into mochi, and changes the shape of those parts to dodge the attacks. With his composure back, Katakuri now regains the advantage, and he traps Luffy's outstretched arm in his stomach as he recognizes how the Straw Hat managed to defeat his brother Cracker.

The chefs then plan to complete the cake while on the way to the Thousand Sunny.","In the Mirro-World, Luffy is intent on beating Katakuri, but Katakuri matches Gear 4 with his Chikara Mochi punches, and Luffy is once again unable to hit him at all. Katakuri binds Luffy with strands of mochi around his body, and assaults him with tendrils of mochi from the ground. Luffy then finds himself overwhelmed as Katakuri creates several remote arms, and is unable to dodge Chikara Mochi for long as he is punched into the wall. On Cacao Island, Sanji reaffirms to Pudding that Luffy will beat Katakuri and their only job is to make the cake, which she resumes doing with great enthusiasm.
Meanwhile, Amande, Mondée, and Effilée arrive at Nuts Island after hearing about it being under threat from Big Mom. Amande watches as the cake-crazed Big Mom lands on the island and begins tearing apart buildings looking for the wedding cake, which horrifies her and Perospero. Back in the Mirro-World, Katakuri predicts that Gear 4 will soon wear off, which ends up greatly benefiting Luffy as he finds out and immediately starts running away. Katakuri transforms his entire body into mochi and slithers on the ground at a very fast speed right as Gear 4 wears off, and Luffy struggles to keep his distance from Katakuri as he now needs 10 minutes before he can use Haki again. Katakuri assaults Luffy with Chikara Mochi, and he struggles to dodge it. However, he then spots Brûlée around a corner, and grows ecstatic as he grabs onto her and jumps through one of the mirrors. Katakuri is aghast that Brûlée left herself open to that, and attempts to grab them before they escape, but is too late and ends up breaking the mirror instead. Luffy and Brûlée end up in a house on Nuts Island, and Luffy's plan to rest there for 10 minutes is cut short when the rampaging Big Mom tears the house apart. There, Luffy and Brûlée watch in shock as Big Mom tears apart Nuts Island while Perospero and Amande try to stop her.
On Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or receives a call from Custard to report that her ship has lost its pursuit of the Fire Tank Pirates. Custard reveals that she has not gotten any signals from the Territorial Sea Slugs, which shocks Mont-d'Or as he is facing the same issue with the Straw Hats pursuit, and he wonders what has happened to them. On the Nostra Castello, Bege wonders why more Big Mom Pirates are not pursuing them, and Vito points out that the Territorial Sea Slugs do not seem to be operating and connecting with the crew's Den Den Mushi as they normally would. Bege commands his crew to take the ship on the shortest route to Cacao Island, where they will pick up Chiffon. On the Sunny, the Straw Hats notice that they are not being pursued either, and Jinbe wonders if Aladine and the Sun Pirates made it out safely. Back on Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or receives a report that the Territorial Sea Slugs are nowhere to be found, much to his shock and anger. Deep in the ocean, the Sea Slugs have gathered around Charlotte Praline, as she sings to entrance them and prevent them from doing their jobs, and Aladine hopes that this will help Jinbe.
In response to this turn of events, Mont-d'Or gathers up several Tarte fleets from all across Totto Land, as well as the Queen Mama Chanter. The thousands of Big Mom Pirates on these ships are ordered to find and pursue the Straw Hats, the Fire Tank Pirates, and the Sun Pirates. Back on Cacao Island, one of the WCI 31 is on the verge of death due to pure happiness from eating Sanji's completed Simsim whipped cream. Chiffon's chiffon cake and Pudding's chocolate icing are finished as well, and Sanji notes that they are making good time. He decides to bring the ingredients out to a ship and construct the cake while they sail toward the Sunny, and gets excited to deliver it to Big Mom.","Monkey D.

Back at Nuts Island, Luffy tries to find a mirror while fleeing from Big Mom.","On Nuts Island, Perospero and Amande try to stop the rampaging Big Mom from destroying the island when Perospero sees Luffy and Brûlée right below him and Big Mom. He points Big Mom to Luffy, and she throws a large section of the peanut tower at the Straw Hat, forcing him to run away with Brûlée in tow. Perospero creates a Candy Wall, and Luffy tries to break it, but his Gear 3 punches are ineffective without Haki. Perospero surrounds Luffy with the Candy Wall as Amande appears behind him and attempts to cut him with Shirauo, but Luffy dodges the strike and pulls himself and Brûlée over the wall, leaving Amande trapped. Perospero then transforms the wall into a slug moving toward Luffy, and Big Mom jumps on it as she demands her wedding cake from Luffy.
The Candy Slug ends up causing even more devastation to Nuts Island, and Perospero and Big Mom lose sight of Luffy. Luffy runs through the street, intending to find somewhere to rest until he regains his Haki and resumes his fight against Katakuri. However, he accidentally drops Brûlée, and she hides inside a chunk of a fallen building, gleeful that Luffy will not find her. However, when Luffy calls her ""Branch"", she inadvertently pops up to remind him of her name, causing him to recapture her and tie her up. With Brûlée on his back now, Luffy heads into a building and tries to jump through a mirror, but Charlotte Effilée shoots it before he can. Effilée shoots at Luffy, but his body bounces the bullets back at her, and he manages to lose her by pulling himself and Brûlée up to a roof. However, he is then confronted by Charlotte Mondée, who tries to attack him with her sword. Luffy responds by putting Brûlée in the path of her sword, preventing her from attacking him. Eventually, Mondée does unleash an attack, but Luffy dodges it and it causes the building below him to collapse. Luffy resumes running down the street with Brûlée in tow, but Big Mom sees him and unleashes a devastating attack with Napoleon.
On Cacao Island, Sanji takes glasses from a chef as he disguises himself in order to head out of the Sweets Factory. The wedding cake is brought out, and the citizens marvel at it and cheer for Pudding and Chiffon. Meanwhile, Pound looks at the procession from behind some foliage, and is delighted when he sees his daughter Chiffon. Oven then arrives to stop the cake, wondering why Pudding is taking it out to sea when Big Mom is headed for Cacao Island. Pudding argues that she does not want to risk Big Mom damaging Cacao Island, and Oven agrees with this and allows her to proceed. However, he attacks Chiffon and throws her to the ground, intending to punish her for her role in Bege's treachery against Big Mom. Pudding wants to stop Oven, but Sanji says that she will make herself a traitor too if she does, although he is unsure how he can intervene either.
Chiffon struggles to get up after her brother's attack, but she is intent on fulfilling her goal to let Nami and the Straw Hats escape safely, and she makes it clear to Oven that she will be going to finish the cake. In response, Oven grabs her by the neck and prepares to execute her, and Sanji realizes that he needs to do something. However, he then sees Pound charging toward Oven to free Chiffon, and Oven drops her to attack him. Sanji then seizes the opportunity to go and kick Oven in the face at high speed, right as he was about to clash with Pound. Oven is sent flying into a building, and Sanji brings Chiffon back to the cart. Pound wonders if he really sent Oven flying, but Oven knows he did not as he gets up and punches his former stepfather into a building. Pudding hides Chiffon under a blanket, but Oven then returns to the cart and quickly finds her. He prepares to burn Chiffon to death despite Pudding's pleas, when he receives a call. One of the Big Mom Pirates reports to him that they are chasing Bege and the Fire Tank Pirates towards Cacao Island, which delights Oven. The Nostra Castello draws closer and closer to Cacao Island, with Bege coming right for Chiffon.","Charlotte Linlin, Napoleon, Monkey D.

Mont-d'Or's group on Whole Cake Island then hears reports from different islands about Luffy being spotted, until finally Luffy and Brûlée make it to a house where they are all alone. Brûlée wonders why Luffy does not just escape to Cacao Island, revealing that the Big Mom Pirates found out about his crew's plan. However, Luffy wants to fight Katakuri, and he realizes that Observation Haki can deplete just like Armament Haki can. However, rather than attempt to deplete Katakuri's Haki, he instead remembers Rayleigh teaching him that Haki grows stronger when one faces strong opponents, and he decides to strengthen his own Haki against Katakuri until he reaches the Sweet Commander's level.
On Cacao Island, Oven contacts Bege as the Nostra Castello continues heading for the island while under heavy pursuit from the Tartes. Oven tells Bege to stand down or else he will kill Chiffon, but Chiffon tells her husband and crew to leave her, thanking them for being her only true family. Oven responds by attacking her, and the Fire Tank Pirates are distressed as they hear her cries through the Den Den Mushi. Bege agrees to meet Oven at the coast, and he calms down Pez as Oven cockily tells Chiffon that this will be the last time she sees her new family. However, Bege shoots an explosive shot that hits Oven square in the face, sending him flying off the cart carrying the cake, and he tells Pez that this is his way of life as his crew cheers and Chiffon weeps in joy.

At the same time, Oven pulls himself up and begins to heat up in a fit of rage. He and his crew brace themselves to attack, but to their surprised, the Nostra Castello speeds up until it hits the coast. Bege then reveals that it is an amphibious ship that can travel on land, and its tank treads take it up onto the island, where it rolls toward Chiffon's group. As the Fire Tank Pirates gun down the Big Mom Pirates, Bege tells Chiffon's group to bring the cake onboard, which scares them since they have no idea how to do that.

The Big Mom Pirates are prevented from using heavy artillery in order to protect the wedding cake, and the Nostra Castello makes it back to the ocean and sets sail for the Thousand Sunny.
Sanji thanks Bege for rescuing them, but Bege replies that he had no intention of saving him. The pirates and chefs then notice that the temperature is rising as the ocean starts to boil and fish begin to die. They look toward Cacao Island and see Oven heating the water with his Devil Fruit, and everyone worries as the increase in temperature threatens to ruin the cake ingredients. The boiling ocean also damages the ship, preventing its treads from rolling. However, Pound then rushes in and hits Oven in the head with a club. The blow only angers Oven, but it does cause him to pull his body out of the water as he angrily turns to confront his former stepfather. As he tries interceding with Oven, Pound sees Chiffon and Pez again, who are happy with their new family in the Fire Tank Pirates. Pound regrets not being able to be a part of Chiffon's life, remembering 26 years ago when Big Mom exiled him right after she and Lola were born, not even allowing him to hold them. He hopes that Chiffon did not have a hard life, being unaware of the abuse Big Mom gave her due to her resemblance to Lola. He then shouts at Chiffon to congratulate her on her marriage right as Oven strikes him from behind with a flaming blade, and Pez starts crying as Chiffon wonders what the shout was about.
Meanwhile, the Sunny crew finds themselves pursued not only by a fleet led by Charlotte Bavarois, but by Big Mom herself as well.

However, Carrot offers to help the crew by using the full moon to activate Sulong, increasing her battle prowess and allowing her to overwhelm Daifuku and his crew.","In the Mirro-World, Katakuri wonders why Luffy chose to face death by returning to confront him again, asking if he intended to subordinate himself to the Big Mom Pirates. Luffy attempts to strike Katakuri as he states that he came to beat the Sweet Commander, and Katakuri says that that is not an option as he dodges all the attacks and prepares to respond with his own attack. Katakuri overpowers Luffy in their clash, and creates mochi arms with Muso Donuts again. Remembering Rayleigh's teaching about how Haki grows stronger when one faces stronger opponents, Luffy attempts to concentrate and predict Katakuri's attack. However, he is hit head-on by the mochi arms and slammed into the wall. Katakuri begins to grow exasperated with Luffy, whom he repeatedly states will never be able to beat him despite Luffy's unwavering drive.
Out at sea, the Sunny crew is confronted by Daifuku's fleet while being chased by Big Mom and Bavarois' fleet, causing them to be surrounded. Bavarois finds out that a fleet led by Smoothie, who is accompanied by Citron and Cinnamon, has come to back the Big Mom Pirates up as well. The Sunny crew finds out that Daifuku is the one who has arrived, and he contacts Perospero to ask for permission to shoot down the Sunny. Perospero grants it, knowing that Big Mom will go to Cacao Island and eat Pudding's cake. He then notices that Big Mom is becoming thinner. Daifuku gets his fleet into position and orders his subordinates to shoot non-living cannonballs due to Big Mom making the cannonball homies unstable. He then waits for the Sunny to get into firing range, and the Sunny crew decides to continue moving forward, preparing to fight. Carrot looks at the moon, and she remembers Pedro telling her that everyone's time will come someday. She then tells the crew to leave the fleet to her, stating that she will use the power of the full moon. Jinbe asks her if she can control Sulong, and she confirms this, saying Pedro taught her.
Carrot then gazes at the full moon and activates Sulong, causing her hair and fur to grow longer and her eyes to turn red as she gains a feral yet regal image. Daifuku's crew notices Carrot and are shocked as they recognize Sulong, and the Straw Hats are equally captivated. Carrot then leaps down toward the ocean, but to the Straw Hats' surprise, she is able to fly over the water toward Daifuku's fleet. Landing on Daifuku's ship, she overwhelms his crew with her speed and takes several of them out at a time with powerful Electro blasts. Daifuku asserts that she will not stop his fleet from taking out the Sunny, but in the blink of an eye Carrot rips off the helm of his ship, leaving Daifuku aghast as his ship loses control. Carrot then leaps toward one of the Tartes as Daifuku summons his genie to attack her. However, Carrot dodges the genie's strike, which slices several Tartes in half as collateral damage. Daifuku's subordinates call out in desperation as his genie continues to attack Carrot, missing every time and causing more damage to the fleet.
The Straw Hats watch Carrot's performance in awe, and Nami realizes that this is the minks' trump card that Inuarashi mentioned on Zou. Jinbe reveals that by gazing at the full moon, the minks lose control of their senses and become more feral and dangerous. However, due to this lack of control, Sulong is a very dangerous ability as the minks can tire themselves out to the point of death within hours if they are unable to deactivate it. Brook then prepares to go and provide backup to Carrot, and runs on the water toward Daifuku's fleet. Bavarois' fleet then comes within striking range of the Sunny and begins firing at it, forcing the remaining crew to defend against it.","Monkey D.

However, Sanji responds that he will feed anyone who wants food, and do nothing more. Bege counters that keeping Big Mom alive is foolish, but Sanji then sticks a spoon of cream into his mouth. The sweetness of the cream causes Bege to collapse, which causes his crew to confront Sanji, but they back off when they see their captain is on the verge of dying from happiness. The smell of the cake becomes so great that a few chefs start to pass out, and Pudding swoons over Sanji's ability.
Meanwhile, Carrot flies from ship to ship while in Sulong form, tearing off their helms and rendering them uncontrollable.

With the cake now completed, Sanji looks forward to seeing his crew again, but Pudding's sadistic side comes out and suggests that the crew might already have been killed, much to the horror of her more pleasant personality when she is reprimanded by Chiffon. She, Chiffon, and the chefs then collapse from exhaustion, and Bege looks forward to Big Mom eating the cake, saying there is no need to poison it as he hopes that Big Mom will die from its deliciousness.
Meanwhile, Big Mom catches back up to the Sunny as she flies on Prometheus. Chopper activates Monster Point to deal with her, but is quickly overwhelmed and injured by Big Mom's sword strikes with Napoleon. Prometheus breathes fire at the Sunny, forcing both Nami and Brook to work to stop the oncoming flames. The Sunny crew refuses to go down without a fight, but Prometheus then expands massively, causing him to torch the Sunny with his heat, and Jinbe says that the sun homie is too big to stop with sea water. All Chopper can do is try to coerce Big Mom to come back down so he can pull her with him into the ocean, but Nami then notices the Nostra Castello approaching, and Big Mom catches the scent of the wedding cake. The Sunny crew rejoices as she heads toward it, and Bege prepares to lure her toward him. Sanji agrees that he can do whatever he likes to her after she eats the cake, and he prepares to head to the Sunny with Pudding on Rabiyan. Pudding bids farewell to Chiffon, and is happy to see her sister living happily with people she loves. Chiffon tells Pudding to not lose the source of her happiness, causing Pudding to become tense as she looks at Sanji. She and Sanji then fly off toward the Sunny, with Rabiyan going fast enough to avoid detection. Sanji reunites with his crewmates immediately after reaching the Sunny, and wonders where Carrot and Pedro are, to which Brook lies that they are both resting belowdeck. Meanwhile, Perospero notes that this situation is intended to split up the Big Mom Pirates. He looks at the cake and gets worried about it, knowing that Big Mom needs to eat it to save everyone from her rampage, but also knowing they will all be in danger if the cake turns out to be poisoned and kills her. He then receives a call from Bege as the Sunny crew begins to head out to Cacao Island.","Charlotte Katakuri, Monkey D.

At Cacao Island, a large force of the Big Mom Pirates gathers and Oven prepares a trap for Luffy.
Inside the Mirro-World, Flampe quietly interferes with Luffy's fight with Katakuri, causing Luffy to suffer a severe injury.","Luffy continues fighting Katakuri in the Mirro-World, and Katakuri's sister Flampe looks on as she prepares to shoot Luffy with her blowgun. Luffy keeps attempting to strengthen his Observation Haki and foresee Katakuri's attacks, and although he is not on Katakuri's level yet and continues getting pummeled as a result, he is developing it very rapidly. Katakuri recognizes this, and as he realizes he needs to finish Luffy off quickly, Flampe successfully shoots Luffy in the leg with a blowdart. The dart causes Luffy's leg to numb, rendering him unable to dodge as Katakuri attacks him with Mochi Tsuki, which results in Mogura dealing a gruesome wound to his side. Katakuri expresses his disappointment in Luffy while Flampe laughs in secrecy, and although Luffy manages to get back up, he is utterly overpowered by Katakuri's kick. Flampe delights in what she did, imagining that Katakuri will be proud of her afterwards and think of her as his favorite little sister. Luffy tries to dodge further strikes from Mogura, but is unable to get back in the fight as Katakuri pummels him with multiple mochi fists created from Muso Donuts, leaving him unmoving in a crater on the ground.
On Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or expresses his disbelief that the Whole Cake Chateau's collapse was the Straw Hats' doing, and Count Niwatori says that if they are this good at planning, they might pull off something unexpected. Swearing to not let that happen, Mont-d'Or contacts the Tartes, telling all of them to go to Cacao Island and bring an end to the Straw Hats. Out at sea, Bege calls Perospero, and the former says that they will put an end to Big Mom's hunger pangs with the cake, pointing out that Pudding made it. Perospero is still suspicious that the Fire Tank Pirates will try to assassinate Big Mom again, and tells Bavarois that their fleet will pursue Big Mom and Bege while Smoothie's fleet continues pursuing the Straw Hats. Perospero contacts Smoothie to tell her about this plan, saying that her fleet should sink the Straw Hats before they reach Cacao Island. Smoothie, her sisters Citron and Cinnamon, and her subordinates then prepare to attack.
While sailing away from Big Mom, Bege says that he cares more about escaping than assassinating Big Mom, but Chiffon reminds him they have a debt to pay to the Straw Hats and so need to keep them safe from Big Mom. Meanwhile, the Sunny crew finds out from Sanji that the Big Mom Pirates know about their plan to go to Cacao Island, and although they are on track to get there in time, their situation is made worse as Smoothie's ship comes and confronts them. However, Sanji gets an idea to rescue Luffy from the Big Mom Pirates' assured lockdown of the island. On Cacao Island, scores of Tarte ships arrive to besiege it; the people who arrive are skeptical that this much force is necessary and some do not even believe Luffy will escape Katakuri and the Mirro-World, but Oven points them to Mont-d'Or, who tells them via Den Den Mushi about the Straw Hats' responsibility for destroying the Chateau. Oven tells his crew to destroy every mirror on Cacao Island, so that if Luffy arrives he will come from the lone mirror remaining right in front of them. The people are reluctant to destroy their valuable mirrors, but Oven says they can throw them into water, threatening to kill the families of anyone who does not comply.
Back in the Mirro-World, Katakuri stands over the unmoving Luffy, lamenting at how the pirate had faltered right as he was starting to respect him. Luffy is still alive, however, and remembers training his Observation Haki with Silvers Rayleigh. A blindfolded Luffy had celebrated dodging one of Rayleigh's strikes, saying it felt like he had imagined the attack coming. Rayleigh replied that Observation Haki is an extension of the imagination, but Luffy needed to develop it to become instinctual. Luffy then wakes up and pulls himself up, much to Katakuri and Flampe's surprise. Flampe attempts to attack Luffy again, shooting a numbing needle ten times as strong as the last one. Luffy manages to see it coming and dodge it, but ends up falling over afterwards, causing Flampe and her subordinates to laugh uncontrollably. Despite their attempts to subdue it, Katakuri ends up overhearing them, and begins to realize that he and Luffy are not alone.","Charlotte Flampe, Monkey D.

Episode 868,One Man's Determination - Katakuri's Deadly Big Fight,"January 13, 2019","After discovering Flampe's presence in the Mirro-World, Katakuri finds her and confronts her for intruding in his fight. He stabs himself to make up for the injury she helped him deal to Luffy, and confronts Luffy again. The two of them use Supreme King Haki to knock out Flampe's group before resuming their fight as equals.
Meanwhile, Chiffon tells Bege to bring the cake to Funwari Island to keep Big Mom far enough away from the Straw Hats. As Sanji and Pudding head off for Cacao Island, the rest of the Sunny crew finds themselves under attack from Smoothie.","Flampe and her subordinates continue laughing as Luffy weakly tries to get up after being utterly pummeled by Katakuri, to the point where they do not even attempt to conceal themselves anymore. Katakuri notices Flampe's group, and then realizes that she assisted him in injuring Luffy. He walks toward her, and as she imagines him praising her for what she did, Katakuri in reality is angry at her interference, thinking that it would make his victory cheap. Katakuri reaches Flampe and proceeds to stab himself with Mogura in the same place he struck Luffy, which horrifies Flampe as a little of his blood lands on her face. Katakuri then removes his scarf and shouts at his sister to not patronize him and Luffy and interfere in their fight. Flampe's shock quickly turns into derision, as she mocks her brother for his display of weakness as well as his mouth, comparing it to a pelican eel's. Her subordinates get in on the mockery, and they decide to expose his appearance to the rest of Totto Land to make everyone lose their respect for him. Although he remembers being bullied and receiving the exact same insults for his mouth as a child, Katakuri simply turns around and heads back to Luffy without saying a word as Flampe's group continues jeering and takes pictures of him. Katakuri then confronts Luffy again, and the two of them agree that the people on the sidelines are annoying as Flampe threatens to shoot both of them with her blowgun. They then each unleash their Supreme King Haki, causing Flampe and her subordinates to be knocked out.
Meanwhile, the Fire Tank Pirates worry about Big Mom being in hot pursuit of their ships, but Bege is confident that they can outrun her especially since they have nearly reached Liqueur Island. However, Chiffon then says that they cannot go there, as it is too close to Cacao Island and would give Big Mom time to get there before the Straw Hats manage to escape. Chiffon says they should go on to Funwari Island instead, and with her intent on repaying her debt to the Straw Hats even if it costs her her life, Bege agrees to his wife's request and changes course to Funwari Island, much to the horror of his crew. Elsewhere, Sanji and Pudding depart for Cacao Island on Rabiyan, and Carrot comes out after waking up from her sleep. However, her talk with the Sunny crew is cut short as Smoothie unleashes a blast of water at the ship, forcing Jinbe to steer it out of harm's way. By stabbing her subordinates, Smoothie absorbs the liquid inside them and becomes much bigger. Despite the pleas by her sisters, she is intent on sinking the Sunny, and the Sunny crew goes to the crow's nest to help Jinbe dodge her water blasts. Jinbe manages to use his skills to dodge them all, annoying Smoothie.
Back in the Mirro-World, Katakuri removes his vest as he prepares to fight Luffy again. He apologizes for Flampe's intrusion, but Luffy does not pay much mind to it since to him, pirate fights are rarely fair. Katakuri then says that he no longer considers Luffy to be below him, which Luffy likes hearing as the two of them charge at each other. Katakuri lands the first blow on Luffy, but Luffy keeps himself steady before using Observation Haki to land a blow square on Katakuri's face.","Monkey D.

Episode 869,Wake Up - Observation Able to Top The Strongest!,"January 20, 2019","Sanji and Pudding prepare to infiltrate Cacao Island, which Oven has stationed with thousands of his siblings and crewmates. In the Mirro-World, Luffy's Observation Haki has developed to the point where he is able to foresee Katakuri's attacks and trade blows with him. With an hour to go before his planned rendezvous with the crew, Luffy activates a form of Gear 4 known as Snakeman.","Luffy and Katakuri continue fighting. Each tries to gain an advantage as they work to overcome the other's attacks, and Luffy, with his Observation Haki at a level higher than ever before, is ultimately able to foresee Katakuri's attacks as well and perfectly match the Sweet Commander's attacks. Katakuri manages to get the upper hand briefly by using Kuri Mochi to rapidly shoot mochi spikes, but as the two clash again, Luffy remembers his training on Rusukaina. He had difficulty dodging Rayleigh's Haki-imbued stick swings while blindfolded in order to train his Observation Haki, and Rayleigh told him he could not eat until he had dodged 100 times. Night fell, and as Luffy lay hungry on the ground, some of the animals he tamed tried to bring him food, but he turned them down. However, he asked them to help him with his training, and they brought several other animals to attack him and develop his Haki. A giant, enraged lion then appeared, and Luffy initially had trouble dealing with it, but got close to it and realized something was hurting it. After the lion collapsed, Luffy found a stick lodged in its body and pulled it out. Rayleigh then came back and resumed Luffy's training, and Luffy successfully dodged 100 blows, even the last one when Rayleigh attempted to hide his presence completely, which Luffy had been able to sense because he felt his mentor smile.
Back in the present, Katakuri slams Luffy into the ground with a mochi fist and creates several Muso Donuts. Luffy then remembers eating with Rayleigh after completing his Haki training. Rayleigh noted that Luffy seemed to possess an unusual gift to be able to sense the emotions of people and animals. He then told Luffy that a few strong people in the world had advanced enough Observation Haki that they could see a bit into the future, and asked Luffy how he would deal with them. Luffy replied that it would depend on their personality, and Rayleigh was intrigued by the answer as he and Luffy went to the next stage of training. In the present, Luffy is able to visualize Katakuri's next move, and is able to perfectly dodge the barrage of mochi punches. Katakuri shifts his attack and is able to overpower Luffy, but Luffy comes right back and lands some hits on the Sweet Commander. Katakuri uses Yaki Mochi to shoot his Haki-hardened mochi fist out, and the fist sends Luffy rocketing all the way through one of the Mirro-World's formations. Luffy gets back up, however, and the two of them exchange blows over and over again until they are both left panting. With neither of them defeated, however, Luffy and Katakuri resume fighting right away.
Meanwhile, Sanji and Pudding fly to Cacao Island, and Pudding's sadistic side is heavily conflicted about her close proximity to Sanji. Sanji makes preparations to get onto the island and rescue Luffy without being seen, and on Cacao Island, several of Oven's brothers and sisters arrive to join his cause. His army now numbers in the thousands, and includes former Sweet Commander Snack, which causes some of the members to deride the excessive force. With slightly less than an hour to go before the Straw Hats' rendezvous time, Katakuri stands over a downed Luffy, and as Luffy gets up once again, the two of them anticipate the rapidly approaching end of their fight. Luffy decides to end it by activating a new form of Gear 4: Snakeman.","Monkey D.

Episode 870,A Fist of Divine Speed - Another Gear 4 Application Activated!,"January 27, 2019","Sanji and Pudding make it to Cacao Island, and successfully sneak into Chocolat Town without anyone noticing. Meanwhile, Luffy activates Gear 4: Snakeman, a form that increases the speed of his punches and allows him to rapidly change their direction. Katakuri responds with powerful attacks of his own, and the two engage in a massive duel until finally hitting each other with finishing blows.","After being beaten into the ground by Katakuri, Luffy moves to end the fight and activates a form of Gear 4 known as Snakeman. During his training on Rusukaina, Luffy had shown the abilities of his Boundman form to Rayleigh. However, Rayleigh questioned how effective it was as he hit Luffy with great speed and used his Observation Haki to dodge Luffy's attacks. Upon entering Snakeman in the present, Luffy throws a punch straight at Katakuri, who dodges it and is confused about why Luffy seemingly initiated a simple attack. However, the punch then comes and hits Katakuri in the side. Katakuri suffers from some more of these attacks before being able to realize that Luffy is rapidly changing the direction of his punches. When Luffy throws another attack at him, Katakuri is able to read it and attempts to block it, but is ultimately blasted away into a wall as the punch gained momentum the longer it was being thrown. Luffy then assaults Katakuri with rapid punches, but Katakuri transforms into mochi and avoids them as he rolls toward Luffy in a donut-like shape. Upon reaching Luffy, Katakuri transforms back into his human body as he turns one of his arms into a massive spiked mochi club imbued with flaming Armament Haki, and he slams the club into Luffy in a move called Zan Giri Mochi. In addition to being injured, Luffy becomes stuck to the club, and Katakuri spins it around rapidly before slamming it into the ground, leaving Luffy at the bottom of a large crater.
Meanwhile, Sanji and Pudding draw very close to Cacao Island on Rabiyan. Sanji orders Rabiyan to suddenly stop, causing Pudding to almost fly off, but Sanji grabs her. He and Pudding then look through binoculars at the fleet and army gathered on and around the island, noting that there is enough military power to destroy it. They try to think of a way to get ino without being detected, and decide to have Rabiyan quickly fly low to the ocean to get past everyone's radar. Nitro binds Sanji and Pudding to Rabiyan to prevent them from falling off, and Pudding becomes infatuated with the idea of holding hands with Sanji. Rabiyan flies very low to the water, preventing anyone on the ships from seeing them, and they successfully make it into the town.
Back in the Mirro-World, Katakuri tells Luffy that any attack the Straw Hat tries to get through to him will only be met with brutal punches from him in response, knowing that Luffy can still hear him. Luffy then gets several random thoughts off his chest before leaping out of the hole. Luffy resumes attacking Katakuri, who meets his punches with mochi-infused fists, and the two deliver powerful hits to each other, culminating in Luffy hitting Katakuri square with Gomu Gomu no Jet Culverin while Katakuri hits him with Yaki Mochi. Luffy then unleashes his next attack, a rapid-fire punching move called Gomu Gomu no Black Mamba. Katakuri is initially hit by it, but recovers and manages to dodge it as he moves toward Luffy and kicks him with the spike on his boot, sending him crashing into the wall. Luffy and Katakuri then say that this next exchange of attacks will be their last. Sometime in the past, Rayleigh went to Shakky's Rip-off Bar, and Shakky wondered how Luffy was doing. She recalled Rayleigh saying that only those who live in the present could shape a new epoch, and Rayleigh reflected on this as he hoped for Luffy to surpass his captain Roger. Back in the present, Katakuri transforms into a mochi donut as he prepares to unleash Zan Giri Mochi again, while Luffy moves his arm around his body and enlarges it in a move called Gomu Gomu no King Cobra. Both attacks hit their mark, resulting in a tremendous clash that rumbles through the Mirro-World.","Charlotte Katakuri, Monkey D.

In the Mirro-World, Luffy emerges victorious from his battle with Katakuri. He finds that Brûlée has escaped, but Pekoms then shows up with a recaptured Brûlée, wanting to help Luffy escape to honor Pedro's memory.","Right as Luffy and Katakuri hit each other with their final blows, Brûlée manages to free herself from her rope bindings. To keep Luffy from escaping the Mirro-World, she decides to run off and join Oven's group on Cacao Island. At 12:28 AM, Oven's army waits for activity to happen, and Newshi ponders the possibility of Luffy beating Katakuri. Oven and several other siblings admonish him, refusing to believe Katakuri could be beaten. However, they do think that Luffy could capture Brûlée and run away from Katakuri when his crew arrives at 1 AM, and so are waiting to ambush him. In a nearby alleyway, a hidden Sanji observes the army's movements, saying he will need to move as soon as Luffy comes out of the mirror for them to have a chance of escaping. He tells Pudding that this will be their farewell, and remarks how they met in an odd way. He remembers his experiences with Pudding, from seeing a picture of her for the first time, to resigning himself to marriage with her, to acting through the marriage ceremony in preparation for her attempting to assassinate him, and finally to making the second wedding cake together. Sanji reaches out for Pudding to come to him, and her violent personality briefly manifests and rejects him, causing her kind personality to become distraught. Sanji remarks that even though Pudding started out as his enemy and had once planned to assassinate him, he is still glad she was his fiancée, causing her to burst into tears. After calming down, Pudding asks Sanji for one last favor, and she plucks his cigarette out of his mouth before moving in closer to him.
At 12:37 AM, Luffy and Katakuri's attacks retract, and the ground falls out from underneath Luffy as Snakeman deactivates, leaving him incapacitated at the bottom of a sinkhole. Katakuri stays on his feet for a few seconds longer and says that he will not lose, but ultimately loses consciousness as well and falls forward. On Whole Cake Island at 12:40, Morgans notes that the Straw Hats still have not been caught and remarks that their ever-likelier escape will be a big headline. Mont-d'Or quiets him, saying that the Big Mom Pirates have put aside their pride and have gathered thousands of their forces to take down the Straw Hats. He says that once the Straw Hats are caught, they will be beheaded to serve as an example, and Stussy remarks about his brutality. At 12:43, Big Mom and Prometheus have gotten close enough to the Nostra Castello to start burning its sails, and the Fire Tank Pirates beg Bege to dispose of the cake and flee. However, Bege says that they all came from different places, and now is the time to remain steadfast and die together if necessary, and Chiffon is able to see their destination Funwari Island coming into view.
At 12:45, Smoothie's fleet has stopped attacking the Thousand Sunny, but Jinbe says they will likely resume once the Straw Hats become involved with the occupation on Cacao Island. Brook tries to negotiate with Smoothie, but fails. Nami says that they will make it to Cacao Island at 1 AM on time, but worries that Luffy will not, noting that he will have to use Brûlée to escape from the Mirro-World. However, she and the crew continue to believe in him. At 12:47, Luffy pulls himself out of the sinkhole, and struggles to walk as he heads for Brûlée. Katakuri then stands up in front of him, and asks Luffy if he will come back and take down Big Mom. Luffy affirms this, declaring that he will become the Pirate King, and Katakuri remarks that he is seeing a ways into the future. The Sweet Commander then falls on his back, defeated, and Luffy puts the hat he received from the Fire Tank Pirates over his face to cover his mouth.

However, he then overhears her wailing over Katakuri's defeat, and comes face-to-face with Pekoms, who has disguised himself as ""Nazoms"" and captured Brûlée. After realizing Luffy knows who he is, Pekoms says that he is going to help him escape to honor the wishes of Pedro's sacrifice, and carries him and Brûlée toward the sole mirror to the island.

Brûlée says that Pekoms and Luffy will be overwhelmed by Oven's army even if Pekoms activates Sulong, but Pekoms ignores her as he carries her and Luffy toward the lone mirror on Cacao Island.
As the clock strikes 1 AM, Pekoms emerges from the mirror holding Brûlée, with Luffy nowhere in sight. The members of Oven's army are extremely confused, and Pekoms holds Brûlée at gunpoint to keep them at bay while he gazes at the full moon and transforms into a massive, wild beast. However, Oven lights Pekoms' gun on fire to get him to drop it before punching the mink, resulting in Luffy being outed from under Pekoms' costume. Some of the Charlotte Decuplets attack Luffy, and he dodges their strikes by jumping over a building, but Raisin leaps up to him and prepares to strike him with his sword.

Meanwhile, Sanji and Luffy return to the Thousand Sunny. Judge has the Germa Kingdom fleet take on the pursuing Big Mom Pirates' fleet, but the Straw Hats are confronted by an even more massive fleet in front of them. However, the Sun Pirates arrive to back up their former captain Jinbe until he and the Straw Hats make it out of Totto Land.","Having escaped from Cacao Island, Sanji flies Luffy through the air toward the Thousand Sunny, but has to dodge cannon fire from the Big Mom Pirates' fleet. They eventually reach the Sunny, and are embraced by their crewmates. The crew is overjoyed to learn that Luffy defeated Katakuri, and Chopper gets to work mending Luffy's injuries, with Sanji leaving his own injury for later. However, the Straw Hats are not out of the clear yet as Smoothie and Daifuku's fleet gets closer to them and harasses them with cannon fire.
In the ruined Peanuts Town on Nuts Island, the citizens and their minister Amande work to rescue anyone in peril from the wreckage. They, along with the citizens of several other Totto Land islands, worry about what might become of them if Big Mom's craving rampage is not stopped. Meanwhile, the Fire Tank Pirates have reached Funwari Island and placed the wedding cake on the coast, but are forced to watch as Prometheus consumes the Nostra Castello with flames, destroying it. Bege then prepares for his crew to leave, but Chiffon insists on staying until the cake is eaten, saying it his her responsibility as Minister of Puff to keep watch over this island. Big Mom leaps off of Prometheus and stands eagerly in front of the cake, and Mont-d'Or contacts Perospero to ask about her status. Bavarois reveals that Perospero has collapsed due to leaving his arm stump untreated for too long, and the weakened Perospero tells Mont-d'Or that the cake has been left for Big Mom. He says that three results could happen: Big Mom dies from poisoning, she does not like the cake and continues rampaging, or she likes the cake and her craving stops. If anything but the third option happens, everyone on Totto Land will die. Mont-d'Or then realizes that Stussy and Morgans are gone and orders for them to be found immediately, not wanting the world to find out if the worst case scenario happens. With Chiffon confident that the cake will satisfy Big Mom, Bege tells Vito and Gotti to look for a ship to escape with while he and the rest of the crew watches the cake's consumption.
Back near Cacao Island, the Sunny continues to be assaulted by Smoothie and Daifuku's fleet, but the Germa Kingdom fleet comes in to give them support. As the Straw Hats pass by the main Germa ship, Judge calls out to Luffy, asking why he values Sanji when his body and mind have flaws preventing him from becoming a perfect soldier. However, Luffy does not understand that this is a question and simply bids Judge farewell, before asking his crew why Judge listed good qualities about Sanji. The crew then quickly finds themselves in trouble again, as they see another massive Big Mom Pirates fleet coming toward them from the front. This new fleet consists of Paddle Ships that are able to rapidly approach their target, and as the crew is forced to deal with their new onslaught, Smoothie's ship gets close enough from behind that Daifuku can attack the Sunny with his genie. Sanji fends off the genie's attacks, but the Sunny is a sitting duck as it is surrounded by hundreds of ships. However, the sea suddenly begins to rise underneath the fleet, and Wadatsumi sends many ships flying into the distance as he bursts out of the water. Jinbe promptly dives underwater, where he sees his former crew the Sun Pirates. He wonders why they came back to help, and they declare that they will serve him until he and the Straw Hats can make it out of Totto Land.","Sanji, Monkey D.

The Big Mom Pirates gain ground against Germa 66 on land, and at sea, the Queen Mama Chanter confronts the Straw Hats and attacks, leaving flaming wreckage in the Thousand Sunny's wake.","On Funwari Island, Prometheus and Napoleon return to normal as Big Mom walks up to the wedding cake, and the Big Mom Pirates tensely observe from afar and wonder what effect the cake will have. With the cake at Big Mom's fingertips, Bege insists that they leave and carries Chiffon away. Chiffon pleas with him at first, but eventually accepts their departure and expresses her confidence in Sanji's culinary skills. Big Mom scoops out some pieces of cake, puts them in her mouth, and swallows. Suddenly, she freezes up, and falls on her back.
The Big Mom Pirates think that she has been poisoned and rush to get medical help, but Perospero then stops them as they watch Big Mom express her joy over the excellent taste of the cake. She gets back up and launches herself at the cake, overwhelmed by its magnificence, and her crew celebrates. As she watches her mother eat the cake, Chiffon remembers Sanji making his cream on Cacao Island, and she had gotten mad at him for doing what normally took a whole night. However, Sanji said he would finish it in two hours, saying he wanted Big Mom to have a joyful expression on her face when she ate it, and in the present, Chiffon remarks that Sanji got what he wished for. Perospero still believes the cake was poisoned, but thinks it just failed to harm Big Mom. He then announces to his crewmates and citizens of Totto Land that Big Mom's craving rampage has stopped, causing them to celebrate and be thankful for their survival. On Cacao Island, the citizens hail Pudding as a hero for making the cake, but she overhears them from the alley and denies it, tearfully remembering the skill and kindness of Sanji.
In the ocean close to Cacao Island, Jinbe stands before his former crew the Sun Pirates, who have all agreed to stay in Totto Land until Jinbe and the Straw Hats make it out.

However, Aladine uses Fish-Man Karate to hit the genie's halberd with a powerful stream of water, disarming it. The Sun Pirates successfully open up a path for the Sunny to sail through, and they bid Jinbe goodbye as he helms the ship to freedom.
On Cacao Island, Snack's fleet attacks and boards the Germa Kingdom fleet, and Judge heads out to confront the former Sweet Commander and his subordinates. All of the Charlotte Decuplets confront Ichiji, Niji, Yonji, and Reiju and merge together into a single massive fighter. As this happens, Oven arrives on a Paddle Ship through the Mirro-World and tells the pirates there that he has entrusted Brûlée with the fight on Cacao Island. Brûlée approaches the Big Mom Pirates with special bullets that will penetrate the Vinsmokes' Raid Suits and harm them, and out at sea, Oven heats up as he is determined to stop the person who beat Katakuri at all costs. He sticks his hands into the ocean and boils it, rendering the Sun Pirates unable to remain in it and forcing them to retreat into the deep.
Back on Funwari Island, Big Mom starts singing while eating the cake, reminiscing of her dream of creating a harmonious land in Totto Land. She realizes that the taste of the cake reminds her of the croquembouche she ate for her sixth birthday party with Mother Carmel and all her friends at the Sheep's House, and imagines herself back with them all. As she sings, Judge clashes with Snack, while his children are overwhelmed by Brûlée's bullets. Mont-d'Or receives a report that the Queen Mama Chanter is about to arrive at Cacao Island, and he celebrates.

The Big Mom Pirates figure out what happened and quickly expose the Sunny again, but the Sun Pirates rise back up to confront them. The crew is soon overwhelmed, and Luffy gives Jinbe permission to go back and help his former crewmates, telling him to meet them at Wano Country. Jinbe goes to the Sun Pirates, and they create a current enabling the Straw Hats to escape from the Big Mom Pirates' fleet and leave Totto Land.","Near Cacao Island, the Big Mom Pirates look at the flaming ship wreckage left in the Thousand Sunny's place, and remark how their victory was inevitable. Mont-d'Or's group on Whole Cake Island celebrates, as do the people on other Totto Land islands when they hear the news. On Funwari Island, Perospero marvels at the effectiveness of Pudding's wedding cake, which has been consumed in its entirety. Big Mom, now back at her normal size, lies on the ground in a blissful daze. Perospero attempts to tell her important news, such as the Fire Tank Pirates' escape, but she does not register his words.
However, back near Cacao Island, the Big Mom Pirates suddenly realize that the ship wreckage is not the Sunny, but is in fact the Sun Pirates' ship. Just moments ago, Aladine had ordered Wadatsumi to put their ship in the Sunny's place, even though Fisher Tiger had built it long ago. Wadatsumi managed to do it in the nick of time, pulling the Sunny underwater and putting it into his mouth before swimming away. The Big Mom Pirates see Wadatsumi underwater, and Oven shoots tendrils of heat through the water. One of the tendrils pierces Wadatsumi, causing him to spit out the Sunny and the Straw Hats in pain. The Big Mom Pirates' fleet quickly turns to pursue the Straw Hats once more, but Wadatsumi stands between them and intercepts the cannon fire. He apologizes to the Straw Hats for his actions on Fish-Man Island, and thanks Jinbe for having later allowed him to tag along. He and the Sun Pirates had decided earlier out of gratitude to protect Jinbe until he left Totto Land with his new crew, and were willing to throw away their lives to accomplish it. Aladine then pulls Wadatsumi underwater, and the Sun Pirates rise up out of it, ready to battle the Big Mom Pirates' forces.
The Sun Pirates quickly get to work taking down their opponents, and when Oven tries attacking the Straw Hats, Aladine charges in and clashes with him. However, the Sun Pirates are vastly outnumbered by the Big Mom Pirates, and are overwhelmed by the fleet's cannon fire as well as by Smoothie and Daifuku's abilities. On the Sunny, Jinbe tells the Straw Hats and Carrot to drain any water flooding the ship and repair the sails in order to get out of Totto Land as quickly as possible, and his comments confuse Luffy. Jinbe admits that he cannot leave his old crewmates behind, and Luffy offers to stay behind as well. However, Jinbe says that the crew will never leave alive if they cannot escape from the Big Mom Pirates' fleet, and he intends to ensure they escape by defending them from the rear. Luffy accepts this, but reminds Jinbe that he is his captain and tells him to reunite with them in Wano Country at all costs. Jinbe then thanks him.
Meanwhile, Big Mom races away from Funwari Island on a candy homie with Perospero accompanying her. Perospero tells her that their crew is currently battling the Straw Hats near Cacao Island, and Big Mom looks forward to getting there and using Luffy's soul to make homies. They pass by the Fire Tank Pirates sailing away on a Tarte, and Bege is relieved that they escaped. Vito worries about the Germa, and Bege notes that Chiffon seems worried as well, although she states she is confident the Straw Hats will escape and that she will see Nami again. Back near Cacao Island, Oven overpowers Aladine in a clash, and Jinbe goes to catch his comrade. Aladine is unhappy to see Jinbe here, but the fish-man says that they all need to survive. He and the Sun Pirates then create a whirlpool that brings forth a massive current which pushes the Sunny further away from the Big Mom Pirates' fleet. Close by, on a flying vessel attached to several News Coo, Morgans overhears what is happening and cheers on the Straw Hats, and Stussy asks why he is doing that. Morgans replies to her that he believes one of the members of the Worst Generation will become the next Pirate King.","Queen Mama Chanter, Charlotte Smoothie, Charlotte Daifuku, Charlotte Citron, Charlotte Compote, Charlotte Broyé, Charlotte Moscato, Charlotte Mont-d'Or, Niwatori, Charlotte Marnier, Charlotte Amande, Charlotte Linlin, Charlotte Perospero, Charlotte Bavarois, Napoleon, Prometheus, Charlotte Cornstarch, Charlotte Mash, Charlotte Galette, Charlotte Cinnamon, Aladine, Wadatsumi, Nami, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Jinbe, the Sun Pirates, and Germa 66 prepare to retreat from Cacao Island, but they are stopped by the arrival of Big Mom. Meanwhile, Sanji gets back to work cooking food for his crew, and as he does this, his father Zeff serves some rowdy pirates at Baratie.","As the Thousand Sunny sails through calm ocean, Sanji finds out that Pedro has died. He is surprised to hear this, and remembers their first encounter on Zou, when the jaguar mink had begged him to save Inuarashi and Nekomamushi from death after Jack's attack. Carrot tells him to not feel bad, as this is what Pedro wanted and they would not have escape alive without his sacrifice. She then starts sobbing, and Sanji comforts her. Chopper is tending to Luffy's wounds when cotton candy snow starts falling, which the crew takes as a sign that they are almost out of Totto Land.
The battle between the Sun Pirates, Germa 66, and the Big Mom Pirates continues raging on Cacao Island, and Jinbe puts himself into the fray as he attacks the Big Mom Pirates' ships. Pudding remains camped out in an alley in Chocolat Town, and weeps as she holds a roll of film in her hands. She remembers being once set to fool and kill Sanji during their wedding, serving as Big Mom's pawn even as her mother frequently made rude comments about her third eye, which she had been bullied for since childhood. Thanks to that, Sanji complimenting her third eye, which Pudding had intended to use to stun him with repulsion during their wedding, caused her to break down in tears. In the last moments of their time together on Cacao Island, Pudding had kissed Sanji, but promptly removed his memories of the event, leaving him wondering what her request was as she ran off. Now, she is alone with just the roll of Sanji's memories.
On Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or tries calling Perospero to find out Big Mom's whereabouts, but is unsuccessful and receives a call from Cacao Island.

As she reaches Cacao Island, Big Mom asks her enemies if they will give her their lifespan or die.
In the Mirro-World, Brûlée goes to the defeated Katakuri and begins treating his wounds. She asks him why he got up and fell on his back after initially falling forward, and Katakuri admits that his reputation of never laying on his back is a lie. Brûlée reveals that she knows this, having seen him through mirrors, but she thinks no less of him, as she knows that Katakuri took on his invulnerable image to protect his siblings. When they were children, Katakuri enjoyed eating donuts with his massive mouth on full display, and if anyone made fun of it, he would just beat them up. However, one day he discovered that the people he beat up gave Brûlée a cut across her face out of revenge, and although Brûlée insisted that he was fine the way he was, Katakuri could not handle his sister getting hurt because of him. Donning a scarf to cover his mouth and wielding Mogura, Katakuri went to take down Brûlée's attackers. In the present, Katakuri asks about what happened to Luffy.

On the Thousand Sunny, Luffy discovers a Raid Suit canister secretly given to him and Sanji by Niji, but Sanji refuses to use it.

Wanting to be a pirate and join Shanks' crew despite his inability to swim, a 7-year-old Luffy tried proving his toughness by stabbing himself under his eye. Afterwards, Luffy continued trying to convince Shanks to let him join as the Red Hair Pirates drank at the Partys Bar. A band of mountain bandits led by Higuma then came in and demanded alcohol, but Makino informed them that she was all out due to the pirates drinking everything. Higuma responded by hitting Shanks over the head with a bottle, and Shanks did nothing more than apologize for the mess and clean up. After humiliating Shanks some more, Higuma and his band departed. Luffy got mad at Shanks for not fighting back, and started eating a fruit he found in a chest. When he saw this, Shanks panicked and revealed that Luffy had eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Devil Fruit which would render him unable to ever swim. Shanks tried shaking Luffy to force the fruit out, only for Luffy's body to stretch as the fruit's powers took effect.
Later, Makino alerted mayor Woop Slap that Luffy was being attacked by Higuma's group. They were powerless to stop the mountain bandits as Higuma prepared to kill Luffy, but Shanks then arrived and greeted them. One of the bandits threatened Shanks with his pistol, only to be shot by Lucky Roux. Benn Beckman then went on the offensive and quickly took out all of Higuma's men. A cornered Higuma responded by unleashing a smoke ball, allowing him to flee with Luffy in tow. Higuma took Luffy out to sea and threw him into the water to drown, but was then eaten by the Lord of the Coast. The Lord of the Coast attempted to eat Luffy as well, but Luffy was saved by Shanks. Shanks scared the Sea King off, but Luffy was distraught that he had lost his arm in the process of saving him. Some time later, the Red Hair Pirates were about to set off to sea, and Luffy had decided to remain behind and form his own crew in the future that would surpass Shanks'. Shanks decided to give Luffy his straw hat, telling him to return it when he had surpassed him, and Luffy watched with the Foosha Village citizens as the Red Hair Pirates departed. Ten years later, Luffy set out to sea on his own, and took down the Lord of the Coast with Gomu Gomu no Pistol.

As the Thousand Sunny is sailing, Luffy wakes up and a Raid Suit canister falls from his pocket. Chopper reveals that the Germa 66 members use those to transform, and he and Luffy beg Sanji to try it on. Sanji refuses, not wanting any part of his family's technology. Luffy and Chopper unsuccessfully attempt to activate the canister, and plead with Sanji again. He voices his dislike of scientific devices like that, and Nami wonders if he feels the same way about her Clima-Tact. She then has Zeus emerge from it, and Sanji grows resentful of the cloud homie for being Nami's servant. Carrot then receives a newspaper, and goes down to show the crew. They see no updates on Jinbe, but find that Luffy and Sanji have received new bounties. Sanji is happy that his bounty is now greater than Zoro's and that he is wanted dead or alive again, but becomes depressed upon seeing that the name on his bounty poster is now ""Vinsmoke Sanji"". Luffy is also aghast at what his new bounty is as well.
It is revealed that due to Luffy's newfound command over the Straw Hat Grand Fleet as well as his perceived masterminding of the invasion of Totto Land, he is now considered to be the Fifth Emperor of the Sea. On Fish-Man Island, the Ryugu Kingdom royals talk about the news as they prepare to head to Levely. With the Sun Pirates now enemies of Big Mom, King Neptune decides that Fish-Man Island will now place itself under the Straw Hats' protection.

The Four Emperors find out that Luffy has been declared an Emperor, and Shanks reacts positively while the other three react negatively. As the Straw Hats sail to Wano Country, they find out that Luffy's bounty has increased to 1.5 billion.","At Marine Headquarters on New Marineford, Sakazuki asks about the statuses of the royals heading to the Levely. One Marine reports that pirates attacked the Lulusia Kingdom ship and kidnapped Princess Komane, angering Sakazuki. The ships of Dressrosa and the Prodence Kingdom sail to Levely together, and Rebecca races up to Riku Doldo III with Leo, Kabu, and Bian, asking her grandfather if he read the article about Luffy. Doldo affirms that he has, and Rebecca's group expresses their excitement over Luffy's accomplishments, but Elizabello II warns them to refrain from expressing such admiration once they reach the World Government's domain. Rebecca then goes to show the article to Viola, but finds that she has read it as well.
Meanwhile, the band of pirates that had kidnapped Komane spies on the Dressrosa-Prodence group from an underwater submarine, and they shoot a torpedo at it. However, Koby dives underwater and redirects the torpedo, saving the royals. The royals still feel the effect of the explosion and are put on guard, but Koby then leaps onto their ship and gets in contact with Helmeppo, who has disabled the submarine, taken out the pirates, and freed Komane. The royals give Koby their utmost gratitude for saving them, and Koby is sheepishly humble in response. When Rebecca approaches him, Koby notices the picture of Luffy on her newspaper and expresses his surprise at seeing him. Rebecca lends him the newspaper to read, and Koby quickly tears up as he reads about Luffy's accomplishments, recalling his life-changing experience with the pirate.
Two years ago, Koby was slaving away on the Alvida Pirates' ship when Luffy suddenly broke out of a barrel some of the crew was planning to drink from. Luffy revealed to Koby that he was going to become the Pirate King, and Koby believed that would be impossible, but Luffy refused to believe that. Koby became slightly bolder as he revealed his own dream to join the Marines, although he was still too scared of Alvida. When Luffy confronted Alvida, however, Koby worked up the courage to stand up to her. Days later, Koby attempted to rescue Roronoa Zoro at Shells Town, and talked about how he wanted to uphold justice as a Marine. After this, he, Luffy, and Zoro were at a bar when the Marines arrived to force the latter two off the island. They wondered if Koby was with them, and Luffy was able to rile up Koby into punching him, causing the Marines to separate them. Koby then asked to join the Marines, and some of them were initially hesitant, but he was accepted as he and the Marines went to thank Luffy and Zoro for their help.
Back in the present, Koby thanks Rebecca for giving him the newspaper, and she asks him if he is friends with Luffy. A flustered Koby attempts to deny it, but Rebecca sees through it and invites him to talk about Luffy with her and the Tontatta. On the Thousand Sunny, Luffy weeps over his new bounty, telling his crew that it was decreased to 150,000,000. Elsewhere, an enraged Kaidou reads the newspaper and wonders why Luffy was in Big Mom's territory. On Whole Cake Island, Big Mom is incredulous at how the story claims that Luffy ""won"" against her, and on another island, Blackbeard says it is still too early for Luffy to be considered an Emperor of the Sea. Meanwhile, Shanks sits alone and smiles, saying the time may soon be near for him and Luffy to reunite.

He then hits Moda away, but her fall is stopped by Belo Betty.
Suddenly, the ground rises up, and out of it emerges the okama giant Morley. The Peachbeard Pirates are stunned at Morley's arrival and feminine appearance, and their gawking causes Morley to become flustered and aggressive, resulting in her moving the ground like clay and pushing it towards them. Belo Betty then steps out and asks the townspeople what they are going to do. Lindbergh flies in, annoyed that Morley attacked too early and prevented him from debuting his new weapon, and a murder of crows flies in that manifests into Karasu. The Peachbeard Pirates are left in shock, with one of them revealing to his captain that these four are the commanders of the Revolutionary Army.
On the Thousand Sunny, Luffy gets up from resting to ask Nami if there is any article in the newspaper about the Revolutionary Army. Nami does not see any, with the most recent report on them still being about the discovery and destruction of their base on Baltigo. Meanwhile, Monkey D. Dragon, Sabo, Koala, and the other Revolutionaries walk through their new headquarters on Momoiro Island. They reach a table where Emporio Ivankov and Inazuma is sitting, and Sabo lies down and starts reading the news about Luffy. The news makes him smile, and Ivankov is also very interested in the news about Luffy and Sanji. Sabo smiles so much that he starts getting a cramp in his mouth, and the Revolutionary leaders wait for the four commanders to arrive so they can begin their meeting. Sabo then receives a call from Lindbergh, who says that they will be there soon. However, Dragon decides to begin proceedings now rather than wait, and Sabo looks forward to preparing for their upcoming declaration of war on the World Nobles during the Levely.
Back in the Lulusia Kingdom, the four commanders prepare to fight the Peachbeard Pirates, and Peachbeard incurs Karasu's wrath when he points out the commander's mumbling. Betty then turns to the townspeople, asking them what they will choose to do and encouraging them to fight. As she does this, she waves her flag around, using the powers of the Kobu Kobu no Mi to awaken the townspeople's full potential. The people are roused by her speech, and pick up sticks to charge the pirates. The Peachbeard Pirates think little of this as they attempt to shoot at the townspeople, but Morley moves the ground to block their shots, Lindbergh uses his new Cool Shooter to freeze their guns, and Karasu unleashes a murder of crows that takes all the guns. The townspeople then overwhelm the pirates, with Moda defeating Peachbeard with a single blow to the head. In the aftermath, a captured Peachbeard promises revenge from Blackbeard, but Betty replies that he does not care about his subordinate crews. She then leaves him in the care of the townspeople, saying they can get his 52,000,000 bounty by turning him in to the Marines, and she also gives them the Revolutionary Army's contact information should anyone wish to join their cause and fight. The townspeople cry with joy, and the commanders talk about the army's plans as they head off, with two days remaining until the Levely.","Peachbeard, Moda, Belo Betty, Morley, Lindbergh, Karasu, Brook, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 881,Going into Action - The Implacable New Fleet Admiral Sakazuki,"April 21, 2019","At New Marineford, Sakazuki discovers that Fujitora has gone to Mary Geoise. He then orders for Ryokugyu to send him away. Meanwhile, Sengoku recalls the incidents at Impel Down and Marineford two years ago.","Two years have passed since the Summit War of Marineford. Sakazuki is now the new Fleet Admiral of the Marines. Due to the catastrophic destruction of Marineford, the Marines decided to build a new headquarters named New Marineford. New Marineford is an even greater fortress built to acclimate to the raging pirate era. It has become the new home of justice located at the entrance to the New World.
Sakazuki is angered when he learns that Fujitora has gone to Mary Geoise. He had only allowed the Admiral to set foot on a Marine base if he had captured Luffy and Law. Fujitora rationalizes his visit by saying that Mary Geoise isn't technically a Marine base. Sakazuki then finds out that Ryokugyu is also at Mary Geoise, so he orders T-Bone to have Ryokugyu turn Fujitora away when he sees him.
He and Borsalino talk about how Luffy's bounty has gone significantly higher. This makes Sakazuki regret not ending Luffy's life when he had the chance back in Marineford. He curses the Great Pirate Era and vows to end it. He recalls Whitebeard saying that, like there are people who have inherited Roger's will, there will also be others who will inherit Ace's. He adds that no matter how they might destroy their spirit, no one will be able to extinguish their flame.
Meanwhile, Sengoku also muses about how quickly the Great Pirate Era gathered so much momentum in just two years. He commends Luffy for making history by being the first intruder to infiltrate Impel Down. Even if he snuck in alone, Luffy was able to escape with an army of inmates who had become allies, including former enemies. He also notes Luffy's ability to make miracles happen, such as when the Gates of Justice opened for Luffy's ship as he and some inmates tried to escape. He then recalls the events in Marineford, such as Whitebeard's arrival, the intense battle between the Marines and Whitebeard's fleet, and Luffy falling from the sky to rescue Ace.","Monkey D.

Shirahoshi gets her first look at the world on the surface.,"The Neptune Family walks through the crowd, escorted by Garp, as paparazzi take photos of them. Shirahoshi shows everyone. However, they are stopped by Sterry of the Goa Kingdom. He was previously a noble in the kingdom and married Princess Nantokanette, but due to the king and prince's mysterious passing, Sterry rose as the king of the Goa Kingdom.
Sabo watches Sterry, remembering that he is Sabo's adopted brother. He recalls when he first met Luffy at the Gray Terminal. Although he was originally hostile to Luffy, they would eventually exchange sake cups for a Sakazuki ceremony, officially becoming brothers. Sabo would forfeit his noble heritage and become a pirate.
However, Sabo's parents would catch wind of this, hiring Bluejam to capture them. Sabo is forced to leave Ace and Luffy and return to his parents' mansion. There, he meets Sterry, whom his parents have adopted. Sabo finds out, through Sterry, that the nobles of Goa Kingdom plan to burn down the Gray Terminal to make the country ""cleaner,"" so that a World Noble could visit.
Sabo attempts to stop the fire, but is beaten by the guards. There, Monkey D. Dragon, leader of the Revolutionary Army, notices him. To the shock of Dragon, Sabo exclaims that he is ashamed of being a noble. Sabo decides to set sail and leave Goa Kingdom as a pirate. However, a World Noble was passing by, who guns down Sabo's ship. Dragon rescues Sabo from the wreckage, who would later accept him as the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army.
Meanwhile, Luffy had been telling the story of him and Ace after Sabo had supposedly died. Ace promises Luffy that he would never die. They both promise to set sail when they turn 17 and become pirates. Luffy would grow up and set sail himself, dreaming of becoming Pirate King.
Back at the Red Line, Sabo captures one of the guards, taking their armor. Sterry continues speaking with Garp, only to be approached by the Neptune Family. Mistaking them for giant fishmen, Sterry collapses, terrified of them. They ride up the bondola to get to Mary Geoise, and Shirahoshi is amazed to see the sun for the first time. Sterry also rides up the bondola, panicking from the height, the wind, and Morley, who watches them from the Red Line.

Episode 884,I Miss Him - Vivi and Rebecca's Sentiments,"May 12, 2019",The Neptune Family and some other royals reach the top of the Red Line and entered Mary Geoise. They then arrive at Pangaea Castle and meet with all the participants of the Levely. Shirahoshi meets Rebecca and Nefertari Vivi after overhearing them talking about Luffy.,"The group of royals including the Neptune Family and Sterry reach the top of the Red Line on a bondola and disembark to a large staircase leading up to Mary Geoise. They are greeted by a guard, who is actually Sabo in disguise. The Neptune Family is given new bubbles suited for the elevated climate, and after traversing the stairs, the royals gaze at the pristine landscape of Mary Geoise. They are still a ways off from Pangaea Castle, but the guards take them to moving walkways known as travelators. Fukaboshi decides to not stay on the travelator and offers to take Shirahoshi through the forest instead. The Neptune Family is escorted toward the forest, and Sterry mocks them for avoiding modern conveniences, but Fukaboshi senses that something is off. Unbeknownst to him, his intuition is correct, as the travelators are moved underground by forced slave labor, with the slaves being on the verge of death. Meanwhile, from the World Nobles' domain, Charlos spots Shirahoshi with his binoculars and is ecstatic to see the mermaid princess.
The royals eventually reach Pangaea Castle, where they happily mingle with representatives of other nations before the Levely starts. The royals are awed to see the famed Shirahoshi for the first time, with many of them offering their sons as potential suitors. Shirahoshi quickly becomes flustered and rejects all of them, causing the royals to feel spurned and get angry. Fukaboshi and Ryuboshi quickly intervene to try to diffuse the situation, claiming that Shirahoshi was speaking in a different dialect while telling their sister to let her suitors down easily. Meanwhile, Nefertari Vivi meets Leo for the first time, and she calls him cute, much to his chagrin. He tells her that he is a pirate who serves under Luffy, and Vivi and Rebecca marvel over their shared connection to Luffy.
Two years ago, Vivi had sailed with the Straw Hats to save her country Arabasta from Crocodile and Baroque Works. On their voyage, they had put x marks on their arms to prevent being impersonated. While in Arabasta, she got into an argument with Luffy, who opposed her ideal of protecting the country herself. After a brief fight, Luffy declared that if Vivi was to shoulder this burden, they would at least shoulder it with her. Crocodile set up a rebel army to try to depose the royal family, and as they attacked the capital Alubarna and fought the royal army, the Straw Hats fought against the Baroque Works agents. Usopp and Chopper defeated Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas, Sanji defeated Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, Nami defeated Miss Doublefinger, and Zoro defeated Mr. 1. Vivi desperately tried to stop the two armies from fighting, and the fight managed to stop as Luffy defeated Crocodile and rain began to fall again on the country. A few days later, Vivi contemplated whether to continue sailing with the Straw Hats or stay behind in her country. As the Straw Hats set sail, she called out to them from the coast and bid them farewell, having decided to stay in her country. In order to keep their goodbye covert, the Straw Hats showed Vivi the x marks on their arms. In the present day, Shirahoshi overhears Vivi and Rebecca and asks if they know Luffy. Ryuboshi quickly try to intervene due to not wanting Shirahoshi to reveal her friendship to Luffy, and Vivi and Rebecca are likewise unsure if she is a friend. However, Shirahoshi does not heed her brother's warnings, and the three of them are happy to find other friends of Luffy as they remember their experiences with him.","Manboshi, Fukaboshi, Neptune, Shirahoshi, Ryuboshi, Sabo, Sterry, Mororon, Ham Burger, Tacos, Beer VI, Matryo Princesses, Sarie Nantokanette, Charlos, Nashi, Mari, Sauce, Neggy, Couran, Moqueca, Lemoncheese, Jeep, Wheel, Furrari, Tritobu, Nefertari Vivi, Karoo, Leo, Rebecca, Kabu, Mansherry, Bian, Monkey D.

Sai gets reacquainted with Rebecca and Leo. Vivi has an unpleasant encounter with Wapol before having a pleasant reunion with Dalton and Kureha.
Meanwhile, a mysterious figure enters a chamber containing a large straw hat.","Vivi, Rebecca and Shirahoshi discuss their experiences with Luffy. Dalton and Kureha appear at the Levely from the Sakura Kingdom, but also Wapol, who had taken over another kingdom. Vivi remembers her adventure on Drum Island.
The Straw Hats previously stopped by Drum Island because Nami had come down with an incapacitating disease. Drum Island was ransacked by Blackbeard before the Straw Hats arrived only to have their own king, Wapol, abandon the country. After the Straw Hats arrived, Wapol returned, and Luffy had to prevent Wapol from taking back the throne. Luffy defeated Wapol, sending him flying away to a faraway land.
Vivi also tells of Chopper and how he became the Straw Hat Pirates' doctor. Chopper was at first mentored by the quack doctor Hiriluk, but because Hiriluk had died, Chopper went to Kureha to continue his medical training. After Luffy defeated Wapol, he invited Chopper into his crew.
Back in present day, in underwater prison Impel Down, former Warlord Doflamingo is chained to the floor on the lowest level, named Eternal Hell. Doflamingo claims that he knows the secret of the holy land Mary Geoise.
Meanwhile, in Mary Geoise's Pangaea Castle, a mysterious hooded figure holds Luffy's wanted poster, approaching a giant straw hat.","Shirahoshi, Rebecca, Nefertari Vivi, Karoo, Fukaboshi, Viola, Igaram, Sai, Leo, Wapol, Hakowan, Kinderella, Dalton, Kureha, Nami (flashback), Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Charlos attempts to take Shirahoshi by force with CP0 protecting him. Neptune prepares to attack Charlos until Donquixote Mjosgard intervenes and knocks out Charlos.","The episode starts with the Neptune Family arriving at Mariejois on the wishes of late queen Otohime.
Another scene shows King Sterry of the Goa Kingdom coming into the Pangaea Castle. He was enamored by the grandiosity of the Empty Throne and wishes to sit on it but his efforts were thwarted by a priest who explains the significance of the throne. This does not stop Sterry's desire to sit on the throne.
In another scene, Shirahoshi was being captured by a slave orders of World Noble Charlos. Fukaboshi attempts to intervened but was stopped by King Neptune who views it too risky to counter the actions of the world nobles. Vivi decides to intervened but was held back by others. Rebecca does the same but was also held back by Sai who tells her that it's too risky to attack a World Noble. Charlos' slave smashed Shirahoshi on the ground in an attempt to subdue her, only to have the spectators more horrified. After subduing Shirahoshi, Charlos announced that he will make Shirahoshi his pet. Leo rushes out to save Shirahoshi while Sai attempts to stop him. With all his efforts lost, he decided to join Leo on the attack, only for both to be stopped by Rob Lucci. Lucci and Kaku tells both of them and countless nations were saved by the wrath of the World Nobles due to their efforts.
In another scene, Wapol was seen appreciating the World Government while insulting all the pirates that exist. A flashback of the Straw Hats fighting at Enies Lobby to rescue Robin was played.
Rob Lucci starts talking about how the World Nobles are sacred like gods due to their impact on the world, thus having more rights. He adds on that if a god wants something, one must give it to them. Vivi protests that this isn't fair and makes no sense, only to be told that not everything has to make sense. Vivi later goes to grab Lucci. This move inspired Neptune to attack the World Nobles. Vivi runs and protects Charlos as she knew the consequences of attacking the World Nobles. Neptune says sorry to Otohime's words and decides to provoke war with humans. Suddenly, Mjosgard appears and strucks Charlos with a spiked club. Mjosgard announces to everyone that he was ashamed by the actions of his fellow world nobles and asks for forgiveness. Wapol questions if Mjosgard is a World Noble. Mjosgard tells Charlos' slave to leave Shirahoshi alone. He kneels down towards Neptune and tells him about how he was indebted to the Ryugu Kingdom. He recounts the story of when he was trapped him the Ryugu Kingdom. When he provoked the Fish-men to return him back to Mariejois, the fish-men fired upon him to shoot him. Otohime rushed and blocked the bullets from hitting him. Otohime tells the fish-men to drop their guns. The fish-men question her actions but she explains that while she knows their resentment towards humans, being resentful towards humans does no good. Otohime wishes to establish better relationships with humans. After telling the story, Mjosgard says that he decided to be a decent human due to this action and was willing to protect anyone in danger.

Back at the Red Port, Garp has a conversation with Gion, Hina, and Tokikake.","Big Mom contacts Kaidou through Den Den Mushi, telling him that she would be visiting Wano Country to personally kill Luffy. Kaidou objects, claiming that his grudge against Luffy was greater. Kaidou had previously operated a SMILE fruit operation with Donquixote Doflamingo, but Luffy destroyed the factory, ending the operation. Kaidou wanted to be the one to personally kill Luffy. However, Big Mom refuses to back down, suggesting that they form an alliance against him.
Meanwhile, in New Marineford, the Marines manage to wiretap the call, learning about the Emperors' plans to kill Luffy in Wano Country. Kizaru suggests Marine intervention, but Sakazuki refuses, since Wano Country was not part of the World Government and was thus outside their jurisdiction.
Garp has a conversation with Hina on the matter, and tells the story of Luffy's adventures after the Marineford War. Immediately after the war concluded, Luffy returned to Marineford and rang the Ox Bell, signalling the beginning of a new era and hinting at his crew members to meet again in two years. The Straw Hats trained separately, reunited at Sabaody two years later, and resumed their adventures.
Garp continues the story. The Straw Hats reached Fish-Man Island to cross the Red Line. After defeating Hody Jones and thwarting their coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom, Luffy would personally pick a fight with Big Mom herself. He would continue his adventures in Punk Hazard. During his struggle against mad scientist Caesar Clown, Luffy formed an alliance with Trafalgar Law of the Heart Pirates, planning to take down another Emperor, Kaidou. On his next adventure, Luffy infiltrated Dressrosa and clashed against its tyrannical king, Donquixote Doflamingo. During this struggle, not only did Straw Hat put an end to Kaidou's SMILE fruit operation, seven powerful crews would join Straw Hat's army.
Luffy continued onto the island of Zou. There, the Mink tribe and the Kouzuki Family would both join Luffy's alliance with Law to take down Emperor Kaidou. However, Sanji was forced to split away from the crew due to a political marriage. The crew would split into two groups, of which Luffy's group went to Totto Land to fight against the Big Mom Pirates and rescue Sanji. Luffy dealt a heavy hit to the Big Mom Pirates because he destroyed Big Mom's castle, foiled a political marriage and an assassination attempt, and took down their most formidable fighter, Katakuri. Although the Straw Hats escaped Totto Land, Big Mom continues to pursue Luffy for revenge.

Episode 888,Sabo Enraged - The Tragedy of the Revolutionary Army Officer Kuma,"June 9, 2019","After Charlos was taken away, Donquixote Mjosgard promises to protect Shirahoshi during the Levely.
Meanwhile, Sabo sneaks around Mary Geoise before going to the Domain of the Gods. Jewelry Bonney, who was disguised as the dowager queen Conney of the Sorbet Kingdom, sneaks into the Domain of the Gods when the injured Charlos is brought back there. When meeting his son, Rosward introduces his rental slave Bartholomew Kuma. While hiding underground, Sabo and his comrades plan to free Kuma.","A disguised Sabo successfully infiltrates Pangaea Castle as he goes through the Celestial Dragon Gate with other guards after a request was made for reinforcements. Inside, he splits from the group and surveys the castle, taking pictures with a special Den Den Mushi. He ends up running into a guard, who confronts him, but he quickly takes out the guard with Ryusoken and places him back at the door. Karasu then flies and makes a racket right outside, causing Sabo to head toward an exit. He encounters two more guards and runs away from them, popping a window open to make them think he jumped out into the abyss. In reality, he is hanging from the ceiling above them with Ryusoken, and he drops down and takes them out. He then runs toward a wall and destroys it with Ryusoken, allowing him to fly away on one of Karasu's crows. Karasu notes he acted recklessly, but Sabo says that they will be picking a fight there anyways.
In the Socializing Plaza, Mansherry heals Shirahoshi's bruise, and Shirahoshi thanks her. Mjosgard tells Neptune that he intervened in Charlos' kidnapping attempt to keep his promise with Otohime. He promises to keep Shirahoshi safe for the next seven days of the Levely, and gives Leo permission to beat up any World Nobles who threaten her. Pell then races into the plaza and apologizes to Vivi for leaving her alone during the incident. She asks where her father is, and he reveals that Cobra and Riku Doldo III are currently meeting with Admiral Fujitora.
Conney, the queen dowager of the Sorbet Kingdom, heads toward the Celestial Dragon Gate and the Domain of the Gods. The guards recognize her, but say she cannot pass and should return to the castle. Charlos is then brought toward the gate as he agonizes over his wound, and the gate opens for him. He is greeted by his father Rosward, and while the gate is open, Conney manages to elude the guards' gaze and run through it. Rosward expresses his disappointment with Mjosgard, and Charlos notices that his father is riding the invincible slave and former Warlord Bartholomew Kuma, having gotten his turn to rent him.
Two years ago, Kuma was assigned by the World Government to dispose of the Straw Hat Pirates on Thriller Bark. He confronted them there, but after Roronoa Zoro offered his life to save his captain Luffy, Kuma failed to kill the Straw Hats. He then appeared to confront the Straw Hats again on Sabaody Archipelago, but strangely possessed several new abilities, including the ability to shoot lasers. It turned out that these were machines modeled after Kuma called Pacifistas; the real Kuma, though, did appear on Sabaody and cause the Straw Hats to all disappear. By the time of the Summit War of Marineford, the World Government's modifications on Kuma were completed, and he confronted his old Revolutionary comrade Emporio Ivankov without recognizing him. Ivankov was dumbfounded, and Doflamingo revealed to him that Kuma had lost his humanity and became the Pacifista PX-0. However, Kuma would then go on to keep watch over the Straw Hats' ship the Thousand Sunny while they were away for the next two years, having ominously told Silvers Rayleigh two years earlier about his allegiance to the Revolutionary Army and intention to help the Straw Hats. He departed from the Sunny when Franky came, and Franky later told the rest of his crew about this, saying that Kuma was one of their greatest allies.
In the present, Rosward takes joy in hitting and stabbing Kuma on a whim, and Sabo becomes enraged as he watches from a nearby alley. He tries to charge at the World Nobles, but is caught and held back by Karasu, and they are pulled into the ground by Morley. Meanwhile, after having infiltrated the Domain of the Gods, Conney transforms into her real form, Jewelry Bonney. Bonney looks at Kuma, and gets tears in her eyes as she says she will never forgive the World Government. Under the ground, Karasu, Morley, and Lindbergh warn Sabo to not get worked up over Kuma, as even though they were saddened as well, they knew Kuma could never return to his old self even if he was freed. They note that the World Government has made a prime example out of him, as he is in this state after rebelling despite having once been a king of an affiliated nation. They warn Sabo that they cannot afford to mess up, and Sabo understands this, saying they can only succeed or die.","Sabo, Fukaboshi, Dalton, Neptune, Igaram, Sai, Ryuboshi, Donquixote Mjosgard, Manboshi, Shirahoshi, Karoo, Nefertari Vivi, Kureha, Rebecca, Viola, Mansherry, Leo, Pell, Karasu, Jewelry Bonney (impersonating Conney), Charlos, Bartholomew Kuma, Rosward, Roronoa Zoro (flashback), Brook (flashback), Tony Tony Chopper (flashback), Usopp (flashback), Sanji (flashback), Nami (flashback), Nico Robin (flashback), Franky (flashback), Monkey D.

Inside Pangaea Castle, the king and queens gather in the conference room to begin the Levely. Meanwhile, the Five Elders have a secret meeting with the mysterious individual known as Imu.","Sabo and other elite Revolutionary Army officers hide underground as Rosward and Charlos leaves the area. Having learned the tragic truth about Kuma, Sabo thinks about Kuma's actions.
During the Straw Hat Pirates' first adventure to Sabaody Archipelago, they were faced against Kizaru, whom they had no hopes of beating. Although apparently siding with Kizaru, Kuma sent the Straw Hat Pirates away to separate islands so they would not be killed. The time the Straw Hat Pirates spent apart allowed them to become stronger when they reunited two years later. Sabo acknowledges that Kuma's sacrifices were necessary for Luffy to rise as a pirate in the New World.
The Levely finally begins and the monarchs sit at their seats for the debate. The monarchs consider offering intervention in the upcoming conflict in Wano Country, but they oppose the idea.
Meanwhile, the Five Elders walk through the corridor while the monarchs are at the Levely. They agree that the conflict in Wano is out of their control. The mysterious hooded figure, Imu, is also summoned. He meets with the Five Elders at the throne room and sits on the empty throne.

Episode 890,Marco! The Keeper of Whitebeard's Last Memento,"June 23, 2019","Nekomamushi and the Guardians reach Whitebeard's home island. Nekomamushi finds Marco in a hidden village where he works as a doctor. During the meeting, Marco tells Nekomamushi about Whitebeard's childhood and the reason he cannot leave the island.","On a certain island, the Guardians prowl around near its shore, and they look at the ruined buildings close to them. Blackback is impatient as he waits for Nekomamushi to return with Marco, but Roddy reminds him that they cannot go where their ruler is to avoid scaring the residents. Behind a nearby waterfall is a small blissful village where Marco works as a doctor, and he uses his phoenix flames to heal a pet sphinx named Tama.
Marco was once the First Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, whose captain, Whitebeard, treated his crew like his own sons. During the Summit War of Marineford two years ago, Whitebeard was betrayed by his subordinate Squard, whose entire crew had been killed by Gol D. Roger. However, Whitebeard instantly recognized that Squard did this as a result of resenting his crewmate Ace, whom they were trying to rescue, being Roger's son, which had been craftily stoked by Akainu beforehand. As a result, he immediately forgave Squard. After successfully rescuing Ace, Whitebeard elected to remain behind and allow his crew to escape, and he asked Ace if he had been a good father, which Ace tearfully affirmed. However, Whitebeard ultimately met his end at the hands of Blackbeard, a former crewmate whom he refused to consider family after Blackbeard had killed his crewmate Thatch. Several decades earlier, a young Whitebeard was asked by his crewmates what his biggest desire was after he showed no interest in their treasure, and Whitebeard had responded that it was a family.
After Whitebeard's death, Blackbeard stole his Devil Fruit, wielding it alongside his own Yami Yami no Mi power to gain unfathomable strength. Blackbeard would go on to conquer nearly all of Whitebeard's possessions en route to taking his spot among the Four Emperors, and Marco led the remainder of the Whitebeard Pirates in an attempt to stop him in the Payback War. However, Blackbeard proved too powerful for them, and now all Marco can do is keep watch over this island, which is where Whitebeard grew up. It suffered from immense poverty that prevented it from becoming a member of the World Government, and so frequently came under attack by pirates and marauders. Whitebeard left the island at an early age, but for the remainder of his life, he sent the treasure that he won to the people there, allowing them to prosper, as this island was his greatest treasure. Marco tells Nekomamushi that the Shichibukai Edward Weevil was going around claiming to be Whitebeard's son and looking for Whitebeard's treasure. Marco has no idea whether or not Weevil is actually Whitebeard's son, though he does know that his mother, Buckin, did sail with Whitebeard around 40 years ago. Regardless, there is no treasure, and so Marco anticipates that Weevil and Buckin will eventually come after him and this island someday. Thus, he will be unable to leave the island with Nekomamushi, and tells him to give Luffy a message. He asks what they will be doing in Wano Country, and is shocked when Nekomamushi reveals that they are aiming to take down Kaidou.","Edward Newgate (flashback), Roddy, Blackback, Marco, Oide, Tama, Nekomamushi, Lonz (flashback), Lacroix (flashback), Portgas D.

Episode 891,Climbing Up a Waterfall! A Great Journey Through Wano Country's Sea Zone!,"June 30, 2019","After reading about the Levely in the newspaper, Luffy's group finds themselves in the perilous sea surrounding Wano Country, which leads to the bottom of a waterfall. Luffy uses the giant carp swimming around them to pull the crew and ship up the waterfall, but they end up sailing into a whirlpool at the top, causing Luffy to be submerged.","As the Thousand Sunny sails to Wano Country, Nami reads about the Levely in the newspaper and calls out to Luffy after seeing the news of Shirahoshi and her family reaching Mary Geoise. The crew then sees pictures of Vivi, their allies from Dressrosa, and their allies and enemies from Drum Island. Chopper takes the paper to cut out the picture of Kureha while Sanji cuts out the pictures of the princesses, and this prevents Nami from reading an article about Big Mom and Kaidou, causing her to get angry.
Luffy attempts to contact Kin'emon through a Den Den Mushi, but cannot connect. Back on Zou several weeks ago, the samurai Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Raizo had revealed that their companion Momonosuke was the heir to the daimyo of Kuri, Kouzuki Oden. However, Oden had been killed by the shogun of Wano and Kaidou, and the samurai asked Luffy and Law to join them in their quest to take down the two of them and avenge Oden. In the present, an octopus covertly makes its way onto the Sunny as the Straw Hats find themselves heading into an area with strong winds and irregular currents. The crew debates whether or not to turn back, but elect to keep going as Nami remembers Kin'emon telling her on Zou that Wano was surrounded by challenging conditions.
The Sunny is swept into a current, and the Straw Hats see giant fish moving under them, causing them to become very afraid. However, the fish turn out to be giant carp, and Luffy immediately starts thinking about how to cook and eat one. After a discussion with Sanji, Luffy pulls himself onto a carp, but is unable to overpower it as it continues swimming. The Sunny crew wonders where this current is leading, and to their shock, they found it has led them to the bottom of a waterfall. As they wonder what to do before they are crushed by the falls, Luffy jumps back onto the ship. He then grabs onto two of the carp swimming up the waterfall, causing them to pull the Sunny up. The Straw Hats successfully make it to the top of the waterfall, and they see land just up ahead, which they assume is Wano. However, they then realize that they are heading toward a whirlpool. Nami forces Luffy to let go of the carp and has Brook try to steer out of the whirlpool, but Brook is unable to do so. A short time later, Luffy is seen sinking into the sea.","Carrot, Tony Tony Chopper, Kaidou (image), Charlotte Linlin (image), Napoleon (image), Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 892,Wano Country! To the Land of Samurai where Cherry Blossoms Flutter,"July 7, 2019","Zoro, Usopp, Franky, and Robin are incognito inside Wano Country. Zoro poses as a ronin, Usopp works as a merchant, Franky works as a carpenter, and Robin trains as a geisha. One night, Zoro is arrested for street murders. On the next day, he is sentenced to commit seppuku. Deducing that the magistrate is the culprit, Zoro attacks him and his men.
Elsewhere, Luffy and the Thousand Sunny washed up on a beach.","In Wano Country, Zoro's group has assimilated in with the populace. Franky is working as a carpenter named Franosuke, Usopp is selling toad oil as Usohachi, and Robin is training as a geisha named O-Robi to perform before the shogun. As night falls, Zoro, acting as a ronin named Zoro-juurou, walks out onto the street. Some distance away, a masked man strikes down another man with his blade. Zoro then comes onto the scene and smells blood on the man, causing him to realize the situation and confront him. He then sees police racing onto the scene to apprehend the slasher, who runs away. Zoro tries to point them to him, but to his shock, he is identified as the slasher and arrested. Zoro initially moves to fight back, but then recalls Kin'emon's orders to stay to his role. When they had reached Wano, Kin'emon warned them that the shogun, Kurozumi Orochi, has the backing of Kaidou, so attacking him or his subordinates would draw the Emperor's wrath. Thus, they were tasked with laying low among the populace.
Later, a magistrate is seen cutting down a straw dummy, but says that a sword needs to draw human blood to become stronger. A tied-up Zoro is then brought before him to face judgement for the crimes he was framed for. The next morning, a messenger proclaims that the street murderer has been caught and sentenced to seppuku, and Usopp is appalled, though ultimately not surprised, to find out it is Zoro. In the magistrate's plaza, Zoro is given the seppuku blade to use on himself. In the meantime, the magistrate examines Shusui, heavily admiring the blade once wielded by the legendary Wano samurai Ryuma and wondering how Zoro acquired it after it was stolen 23 years ago. The magistrate looks forward to possessing Shusui, but as Zoro picks up the seppuku blade, he smells blood on the magistrate, causing him to identify him as the slasher. Zoro then imbues his blade with Armament Haki and unleashes a flying slash that cuts down the magistrate. Apologizing to Kin'emon, Zoro proceeds to cut down the magistrate's subordinates as he works to get his swords back.
Meanwhile, Luffy is woken up after a crab pinches his nose, and he finds himself washed up on a beach with the Thousand Sunny. Luffy stands in front of the Sunny, trying to figure out what had happened, when he suddenly hears a commotion in the forest caused by two animals fighting, and he shouts as a komainu is sent tumbling towards him.","Monkey D.

Episode 893,O-Tama Appears - Luffy vs. Kaidou's Army!,"July 14, 2019","While fighting the magistrate's men, Zoro retrieves his swords and demolishes the magistrate's home. Afterwards, Zoro becomes a wanted man.
Back at Kuri Beach, Komachiyo and Hihimaru are fighting near the Thousand Sunny. Two Beasts Pirates arrive with a captive girl and try to capture Luffy. He easily defeats them and frees the girl, who introduces herself as Tama. After Tama tames Hihimaru, Luffy gets acquainted with her.","Right after Zoro's attack on the magistrate, the magistrate's remaining subordinates race to cut him down. Zoro holds them off with the seppuku blade and a stolen sword, and after the latter gets broken, he makes his way to the magistrate's platform where he reacquires his three swords. With all of them equipped, Zoro unleashes a massive whirlwind attack that overpowers all his enemies and destroys the magistrate's home. In the aftermath, Zoro's wanted poster is put up across the city. Franky is surprised when he hears the news and Robin is covertly shocked to see Zoro's poster. Usopp is left aghast seeing it as well, which causes a police officer to suspect he knows Zoro. Usopp denies this and lies that Zoro's actions made him fear for his family's safety, and the policeman assures him that Zoro will be captured. Meanwhile, Zoro drinks sake under a bridge before seeing his wanted poster.
On a beach, Luffy tries figuring out how he got here when he hears a commotion in the forest nearby, and a komainu named Komachiyo then comes tumbling toward him. Komachiyo crashes into the Thousand Sunny, which annoys Luffy. A giant baboon then emerges from the forest and unsheathes a sword before charging at Komachiyo, resulting in a brawl between the two of them. Luffy leaves them be and gazes out at the ocean, recalling what had happened when he and his crew were being pulled into the whirlpool. Sanji had decided to take Nami, Carrot, Chopper, and Brook to land, and Luffy ballooned himself to give Sanji a trampoline. After Sanji took everyone else to the air, Luffy prepared to jump to land as well, only for the octopus that had stowed away to hold him back, which caused Luffy to go into the water and wash up here with the Sunny. Luffy does not know whether or not he made it to Wano.
Meanwhile, two Waiters ride a Madsaurus through the forest near the beach, with one of them carrying a bag containing O-Tama, a girl whom they kidnapped. Tama tries to claim innocence, but the scout clearly recalls her threatening for the Kouzuki Family to take revenge on them, which was insolent and illegal speech. They consider selling her to a brothel after they apprehend the intruder spotted on the nearby beach, and they plan with their superior to knock him out and enslave him. As they reach the beach, the first Waiter takes aim at Luffy, but the pirate captain notices his presence and dodges the Waiter's first shot. As the Waiter lines up to fire again, Luffy punches him from afar, knocking him out. The second Waiter remains conscious despite being heavily injured, and orders the baboon to stop fighting Komachiyo and attack Luffy. The baboon obliges, but Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to make it submit. As the dumbfounded Waiter tries to attack Luffy himself, Tama escapes and hits him over the head with a staff. The attack only makes him angry and he chases her, but Luffy then punches him into the distance. Tama immediately surrenders to Luffy, and when he assures her he will not do anything to her, she uses this moment as a distraction. She then pulls a piece of kibi dango off her cheek and offers it to the baboon, but it aggressively scares her away. She runs behind Luffy and throws the kibi dango at the baboon, where it lands in its mouth and tames it. Tama introduces herself and Komachiyo to Luffy, and reveals to him that he is indeed in Wano, in the region of Kuri.","Monkey D.

Episode 894,He'll Come - The Legend of Ace in Wano Country!,"July 21, 2019","Tama takes Luffy to her house to feed him as thanks for saving her, and Luffy meets her master Tenguyama Hitetsu. Tama then starts ailing due to having drunk tainted river water, and Hitetsu reveals that she has been living here in poverty to wait for Portgas D. Ace to return. To their shock, Luffy reveals that Ace is dead, and Hitetsu explains the relationship between Tama and Ace.
Meanwhile, Basil Hawkins and his men prepare to investigate the incident Luffy caused on Kuri Beach.","Tama explains to Luffy how she was hunted down by the evil men after shopping in town, prompting Komachiyo to protect her from Hihimaru. She enthusiastically offers to make Luffy a meal to thank him for coming to her rescue, and so they hide the Thousand Sunny in a cave by the shore, and make their way into the dense bamboo forest so the young girl can return home. On the way, Tama tells Luffy that he is strong and kind, and while she detests most pirates, Luffy is the kind of pirate she likes. Luffy asks if she lives in a village, but Tama states that she lives alone with her master, and declares her dream of becoming a bewitching ninja.
Inside her house, Tama carefully prepares a tall bowl of rice as Luffy admires the modest household. She serves the rice to Luffy, who befittingly scarfs it down. He wastes no time asking for seconds, however Tama tells Luffy that what he just ate was all she made, as Luffy respectfully buries his disappointment. Suddenly, Tama's own stomach growls violently, and she quickly excuses herself. The birds outside scatter, as an imposing figure soon approaches.
In Tama's absence, Luffy commends the girl for her generosity and her delicious food, despite the portions. His thoughts are interrupted by the sudden barging in of the imposing man, who demands to know who Luffy is. After briefly mistaking the man for his friend Usopp, due to the familiar looking nose on his Tengu mask, the man notices the empty rice bowl beside Luffy and angrily draws his blade to attack him. Tama is seen drinking from a creek near the house enduring an aching stomach, before witnessing Luffy crashing out from the house.
The man scolds Luffy for eating the rice, to which Luffy replies that Tama willingly cooked it for him. The man bemoans over Tama's true situation. Forced to sell woven hats, Tama hardly earns enough money to feed one person alone. Every birthday, she saves up her money to buy rice at the market, the very rice she had recently fed to Luffy. Luffy notices the ruined remains of houses around him. Tama runs up and confronts the man, calling him her master, and asking for forgiveness, only to collapse from some sort of ailment. As the two rush to her care, the master explains that she must've drank poisonous river water, polluted by Kaidou's factories, to curb her hunger. He says Tama remains in this forest because she is waiting for none other than Luffy's brother, Ace, to return. However, Luffy unceremoniously informs Tama that Ace is dead, causing her to erupt in a tantrum of disbelief, before passing out all together.
As Tama rests inside, the man, named Hitetsu, criticizes Luffy's lack of sensitivity, but Luffy insists that it doesn't change the fact that Ace won't come back, and that Tama waits in vain. Hitetsu elaborates on the history of their village, and how it was annihilated roughly a year ago by X Drake and his soldiers. While the Flower Capital of Wano Country prospers, the smaller villages have become wastelands of poverty and starvation, courtesy of Kaidou's weapon factories. Hitetsu then enlightens Luffy on Ace's arrival in the country. Around four years ago, Ace and a handful of pirates washed ashore on their village. Having little food, and little options, the villagers tied the pirates up and stole their food supply. After allowing the village to finish eating his food, Ace easily freed himself using his Devil Fruit power, and rather than retaliate, he headed into the forest to find more food for them. With Tama taking an especial shine to him, Ace remained for a number of weeks to aid the village, before finally disembarking.
Luffy contemplates his brother having stood on the same land he finds himself in, along with the impact he left on it. The episode concludes with a band of swordsmen led by Basil Hawkins on their way to investigate the incident involving their two watchmen. Hawkins instructs his men not to report it to Kaidou.","Komachiyo, Monkey D. Luffy, Tama, Hihimaru, Massui (flashback), Bunbuku, Tenguyama Hitetsu, Kaidou (fantasy), Portgas D.

Episode 895,Special Edition! The Strongest Bounty Hunter Cidre,"July 28, 2019","The Straw Hat Pirates are ambushed by a group of bounty hunters led by Cidre out at sea. After escaping the attack, the Straw Hats go to an island with carbonated water. Luffy separates from his crew to explore the island. The bounty hunters attack him once again but Luffy also meets Boa Hancock again. They later go to the Cidre Guild's stronghold and encounter Cidre.","Buena Festa contacts the bounty hunter Cidre to reveal to him that Douglas Bullet will be attending the upcoming Pirates Festival. Cidre looks forward to killing all the pirates in attendance, whose combined bounties are projected to total over 10,000,000,000, but is intent on taking down Bullet especially. Festa says that Bullet is not the only attraction, as Monkey D. Luffy has also been invited, but Cidre reveals that his guild is already working on taking down the Straw Hat Pirates.
Out at sea, the Straw Hats are under attack by the Cidre Guild, who are flying on saucer-shaped vessels. Under the command of Ginger and Guarana, they blast the Thousand Sunny with carbonated water from special guns. The Straw Hats take down many of the members, but they are still overwhelmed, so they manage to escape using Coup de Burst. After landing, the crew recognizes that the Cidre Guild uses carbonation in their attacks like the Sunny does, and they immediately go to repair the damage on the Sunny. This leads them to find out that the ship's cola supply has run out, and they decide to get more as soon as possible in case the Cidre Guild attacks them again. Fortunately, they very soon reach an island, and Luffy volunteers to head out and buy a barrel of cola.
Luffy ventures on the island to find it contains pools of carbonated water, and sits with his feet in a pool as he drinks a bottle of cola. After drinking it all, he runs into the ramune saleswoman Caramel, who reveals that he can only buy a whole barrel of carbonated drink from the island's factory. However, she warns that the island is under the control of the Cidre Guild. Luffy runs toward the factory, but is confronted by Ginger and his subordinates. Luffy battles them, but is hit by a powerful carbonated liquid attack, sending him falling into a sinkhole, where he is swept away by an underground river.
Elsewhere on the island, Boa Hancock is having a bath when Luffy suddenly emerges from one of the spouts. Hancock is very flustered and happy to see him again. However, Guarana reports to Cidre that Hancock and Luffy are together on the island, and Cidre decides to take the opportunity to take down both of them and blame Hancock's death on Luffy. Ginger then leads his forces to Hancock's bathing location, where they are attacked by Boa Sandersonia, Boa Marigold, and Elder Nyon. However, Ginger blasts through them and the wall, and they enter the bath. Luffy stands in front of Hancock to keep her Hoof of the Soaring Dragon hidden, but Hancock takes a stand as well and assists in attacking them. Nyon gives Hancock her clothes, and the group takes down all of Ginger's subordinates. Being the last one standing, Ginger unleashes carbon dioxide gas, forcing Luffy and Hancock to escape together while Sandersonia, Marigold, and Nyon are split up from them.
Guarana reports to Cidre that Luffy and Hancock are heading toward the factory, and Cidre decides to go after them himself. Near the factory, Luffy apologizes for getting Hancock involved in the recent fight, but Hancock is happy to see him, thinking they would not reunite until the Pirates Festival. Luffy does not know what that is, and she reveals that it is an event that happens at random intervals where powerful pirates gather from all over the world. Luffy is intrigued by this, but Cidre then flies in and attacks, blowing a hole in the ground with a carbonation-powered punch. Luffy tells him he just wants cola, but Cidre says he will not sell any to pirates. He and his subordinates confront Luffy and Hancock, and he charges toward Luffy to acquire his 100th kill.","Buena Festa, Franky, Tony Tony Chopper, Nami, Monkey D.

The Straw Hats sail to Delta Island for the Pirates Festival, and find out that it will have a race for Gol D. Roger's treasure.","Cidre charges toward Luffy and their fists clash, resulting in a large impact that the Straw Hats see from the coast. They are in the midst of attacking the Cidre Guild members when the latter group reveals that they have no loyalty to Cidre and are enslaved to him. Back near the factory, Guarana and her forces fly in to join Cidre, and Hancock turns all of Guarana's subordinates to stone. Guarana activates two swords of carbonated water to attack Hancock, and Luffy and Cidre continue clashing, with Luffy's punches being powerful enough to match Cidre's carbonation-enhanced attacks. Luffy manages to repel Cidre by ballooning himself, sending Cidre crashing into a cliff. Cidre is angered by Luffy's actions, recalling how he was left injured in a destroyed city many years ago by Douglas Bullet. Ginger then comes riding in to attack, but Cidre decides for them to retreat into the factory in order to activate their most powerful rig.
Cidre enters the factory while Guarana, Ginger, and their subordinates guard the outside, but Luffy manages to avoid them by pulling himself into the factory. Hancock, Sandersonia, and Marigold confront Guarana and Ginger, and Hancock uses her agility to avoid their carbonated attacks as she lands hits on them, causing them to be turned to stone. Meanwhile, Luffy races through the factory until he finds Cidre putting on his rig. With this rig, Cidre dons barrels on his arms that rapidly spin, and he hits Luffy with an attack so powerful it sends him crashing through several walls. Luffy is barely hurt by the attack, though Cidre's power remains an issue. However, Cidre does quickly run out of carbonated water and is forced to replenish his barrels. Eventually, he hits Luffy out of the factory, and as he stands over the pirate, he declares his intention of bringing down every pirate to get his revenge as well as money. Luffy is not impressed by Cidre's weakness and lack of resolve, and attacks him with Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun. After a brief clash, Luffy overpowers Cidre and defeats him.

However, they are soon confronted by Hawkins.","As he stands atop the tree over Hitetsu's house, Luffy remembers Ace dying in his arms on Marineford two years ago. As Hitetsu comes out, Luffy asks him where he can find food, water, and a doctor, saying he wants to take Tama there. Hitetsu says that one could find those things in the nearby town across the wasteland, but warns Luffy that it would be a dangerous journey with the Beasts Pirates roaming around. However, Luffy is undeterred, telling Hitetsu that he is strong. Hitetsu says his foreign clothes are too conspicuous and puts a kimono, obi, and topknot on him. The swordsmith says he cannot leave the town due to undisclosed reasons, but he promises to compensate the cost of the doctor visit later.
Luffy then sees a sword with a purple aura sitting on the wall and decides to take it for his journey. As he picks up Tama and prepares to head out, Hitetsu says he cannot just take the sword, revealing that it is Nidai Kitetsu, which was forged by his ancestor Kotetsu and is one of the great grade Meito. Hitetsu starts explaining the Meito grades, only to see Luffy running off toward the town. He chases after Luffy to continue trying to get Nidai Kitetsu back, revealing that it is cursed. Luffy offers to take the sword on Hitetsu's hip instead, but Hitetsu says that that is also a Meito. Luffy then grabs Hitetsu by the nose and tosses him back. Hitetsu tries shouting at him to come back, but to no avail.
Komachiyo then comes running after Luffy, allowing him and Tama to ride on his back toward the town. Tama then wakes up, but as she looks at Luffy, she immediately remembers him telling her about Ace's death. She cries out and starts hitting Luffy, calling him a liar and saying that there is no way Ace is dead since he made a promise with her to return. When he came to Wano three years ago, she had asked to join his crew, and he told her he would come back in the future when she had grown up become an enchanting kunoichi. Tama simply cannot accept that this promise would not come to pass, and Luffy is simply resigned to repeating the truth. They then reach the edge of the bamboo forest, and Luffy is shocked as he sees a massive wasteland dotted with factories and wild animals in front of him.
In the Flower Capital, Zoro remains at large and the public is still left worried, wondering why the police have not been able to capture him yet. Zoro is currently camping out in the wasteland, cooking and eating large quantities of meat from several animals that he hunted. Elsewhere in the wasteland, Luffy wants to catch and eat one of the animals, but Tama tells him that their meat is poisoned due to drinking the polluted river water. She reveals that the shogun and Kaidou have a private, unpolluted farm that gives them a wealth of food, and she becomes overwhelmed by hunger as her fever increases. Luffy then sees a woman being chased by two Beasts Pirates in the distance, but Zoro then comes in and quickly takes out the attackers. The woman wishes to repay Zoro, but does not have any sake as he requests. Luffy eventually recognizes Zoro and rushes to embrace him as the two happily reunite. Smelling meat in Zoro's possession, Luffy takes it from him and starts eating it. He reveals the meat is poisoned, and Zoro realizes that that is why he has a stomachache. Zoro then sees Tama laying on Komachiyo's back, and tells Luffy that they need to get going quickly. Suddenly, however, Hawkins and his crew arrive on the scene and confront them. Hawkins recognizes that Luffy has a high chance of being the intruder on Kuri Beach and draws out his sword, saying the only way to survive here it to submit to the strong. Luffy and Zoro pull out their swords, and Zoro says that Kin'emon ordered them to lay low, but Luffy says that they will have to apologize to him later.","Tama, Tenguyama Hitetsu, Portgas D.

At the teahouse, one of the waitresses is harassed by Urashima, a professional sumo wrestler. Komachiyo arrives, they enter the teahouse, and Zoro scares off Urashima.

However, they are attacked by Batman, a SMILE user, and Tama is kidnapped by Gazelleman.","Luffy, Zoro, Tsuru, Komachiyo, and Kiku, settle into the tea house in the destitute Okobore Town to treat Tama's illness. As the child lies in bed, Kiku hands Luffy a crucible of strong medicine. The medicine is very bitter, and Tama puts up some resistance in taking it, but Luffy forces it upon her.
Some time later, Kiku approaches Zoro, who now waits just outside. She offers to nurse Zoro's injuries from his earlier battle. He asserts to the woman that his wounds will heal on their own, but Kiku does not back down, and so Zoro silently complies. Meanwhile, inside the house, Tama wakes from her unconsciousness. Tama evaluates how she is feeling, and affirms everyone that her good health has returned at last. Luffy and the others rejoice, surprised at how quickly the medicine took effect. Despite Tsuru's warning to never again drink from the polluted river, Tama's unbearable hunger seizes her once more, and she begins dashing off to get a drink. Tsuru stops Tama in her tracks, scolding her a second time.
Zoro thanks Kiku as she finishes bandaging him up, and she reflects her gratitude to Zoro for driving off Urashima. Back inside the tea house, Tsuru serves Tama a bowl of sweet red-bean soup, but Tama refuses to accept it, for she is unable to pay for the food, let alone the medical treatment. Tsuru claims that payment is out of the question, but Tama still protests out consideration for Tsuru and Kiku's well being, as food is scarce in Okobore. After politely and repeatedly urging Tama to eat, Tsuru looses her temper and frightens Tama into accepting the meal, threatening to toss the soup into the dusty street otherwise.
Outside, Luffy and Zoro sit beside Tama as the girl reluctantly gazes into the bowl of soup. Luffy reminds Tama that it is after all, her birthday, and encourages her to dig in. The two pirates, along with Tsuru, watch Tama take her first sip. As tears drip into the bowl, and a giddy smile spreads across her face, Tama is elated, pronouncing how delicious the food is, and that this day has has been the greatest of her life. Tsuru is driven to tears herself, but Luffy mulls over Hitetsu's words about how impoverished Tama has been all this time. Luffy remarks how similar the dango in Tama's soup is to her Devil Fruit ability, but Tama responds that the dango made from her power cannot actually fill a person's stomach.
Tama then falls asleep, while Luffy grows furious towards Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates for desecrating Kuri's land and its people. Zoro stops Luffy from nearly blowing his cover to Tsuru, but she sees through both of their disguises, deducing that they are both foreigners. However, she vows not to tell anyone, and begins to explain the history behind the town. A vineyard once known as Paradise Farm was created by the ruling Kouzuki Family to feed the village, but when the Beast Pirates and Shogun Orochi usurped the throne, the farm became off limits, and Okobore has become dependent on the little rations permitted to them by Bakura Town, the city of officials. Unbeknownst to the group, their conversation is being spied on by an enemy.
As Tsuru continues to expound, and a powerful arrow is fired at her head from some distance, which is skillfully blocked by Zoro's blade. With Tsuru startled speechless, the arrow somehow remains airbone, still pressing against the face of his sword, before Zoro finally deflects it, much to the assailant's shock. The enemy reveals himself, flying high on a pair of bat wings, and discloses his bat SMILE abilities. Zoro and Luffy challenge Batman, as he declares to them his duty of silencing any rebellious spirit among Orochi's subjects, and launches a storm of arrows their way. Zoro swiftly parries all the incoming attacks with his sword, however Batman exhibits his ability to freely control the flight pattern of his arrows, enacting the duo to use their Busoshoku Haki to defend themselves. Zoro puts an end to the onslaught with an explosive sword technique. Baffled, the bat-human questions if Zoro could be the one-eyed Ronin outlaw.
Engaged in battle, Luffy and Zoro have left the sleeping Tama unattended, and without warning, she is snatched up suddenly by a second foe. As the quick-footed Gazelleman sprints off with his prize, Luffy and the others are too late to stop him, with Tama awaking in horror, and crying out for Luffy to save her.","Komachiyo, Tama, Monkey D.

In Bakura, a sumo match is commencing in the town square, exciting a large crowd. Urashima, in a nearby bar, is steaming over Zoro putting a stop to his advances on Kiku earlier. His troubles are overheard by Mouseman, who tells the wrestler that he's got the wrong idea about wooing Kiku. He poses that if Urashima were to use his social influence against the poverty-striken woman, destroying all she cares for so that only he remains, leaving her with nowhere else to turn would be much easier than winning her love. They both laugh mischievously over the thought, and Urashima exercises his newfound sense of supremacy by commanding the elderly bar owners to cook their pet raccoon-dog for him to eat.
Tama is brought to Holed'em's dwelling, and is pushed before him. Holed'em's ferocious lion's head has Tama reeling in fear, as Luffy's group closes in on the town's archway. Tama tries to act strong as Holed'em's true appearance comes to light. The lion's face is only attached to the real Holed'em's waist, and has a mind of its own. Holed'em starts to pick a fight with the lion, who retaliates by striking him in the crotch with great force. Holed'em howls in pain, as well as the lion, due to both of them sharing the same body. His subordinates question why they never seem to remember such a weakness. After regaining his senses, Holed'em interrogates Tama about how she tamed Hihimaru. Refusing to disclose her ability to the enemy, Tama claims that animals are simply fond of her. Holed'em however is not fooled, and already knows from his men that her power has something to do with pulling on her cheek. He orders his men to fetch a pair of pinchers and seizes Tama, while she shouts out for Luffy once more.
As the town guards brace for Luffy's intrusion, Bepo is seen overlooking the valley, and is appalled when he identifies Luffy. Resting in a tent, Luffy's presence is reported to Law.

The children regard Shogun Orochi as a hero who brought peace to Wano. An eves-dropping old man is highly disturbed by the classroom's teachings.
In a different location, the city's money manager, Kyoshiro, is drinking with a friend as he shamelessly belittles Orochi for being a coward. Robin, who happens to be present preforming for the two, listens in. Kyoshiro muses about the supposed final words of Oden's wife uttered 20 years ago, before snoozing off mid-story. He then resumes, claiming that Oden's wife placed a curse on Orochi, that the nine samurai of the family will return in 20 years time to kill Orochi and restore the throne. Kyoshiro is driven to laughter, amused that Orochi seems to be frightened by the empty threats of dead men.
Luffy and the others arrive at the castle ruins, as Zoro's battle in the woods rages on. Kiku isn't able to bare the sight of the destruction, and stays idly behind. As Law leads the way, he directs Luffy towards a cluster of nine distinct grave posts. As he inspects them closer, Luffy is taken back to see graves marked for Kin'emon and Momonosuke. He remembers how he wasn't able to contact the samurai while nearing the island, and Law confesses that he too hasn't heard from them in some time, but Luffy refuses to assume the worst has happened. Just then, a chilling presence begins lurking towards them. Luffy and Law steel themselves, before realizing who it is. It's Kin'emon, alive after all, who verifies that he's been having indigestion for days, and has been confined to the bathroom all the while. Relieved that Law was only miscommunicating, Luffy is glad to see Kinemon again, who is then suddenly embraced by Kiku, indicating that she and Kin'emon know each other well. Soon after, Momonosuke enters the scene. He excitedly reunites with Luffy, and informs him that Inuarashi has likewise made it to Wano.
The whereabouts of Nami, Chopper, Sanji, Brook, and Carrot are finally shown. After attempting to search for their captain, the group decided to make their way to the castle as per instruction. They've now arrived just in time to reassemble with Luffy and the samurai. They all cheerfully welcome each other back, and Law states that he was the bandit lifting food from Paradise Farm, disclosing that they should have a clean food supply.
Kin'emon invites Law and the Straw Hat Pirates to take shelter in the castle's remains. There, Kin'emon admits to his comrades that he has one last secret yet to tell them, but he fears it would be too unbelievable. Luffy implores Kin'emon to tell them everything, and Kin'emon proclaims that he, Kiku, Momonosuke, Kanjuro, and Raizo are not from this time period. In reality, they all came from 20 years in the past, and have come to present-day Wano to fulfill their commitment.","Komachiyo, Monkey D. Luffy, Roronoa Zoro, O-Kiku, Trafalgar D.

Episode 910,A Legendary Samurai - The Man Who Roger Admired!,"November 17, 2019","Kin'emon explains to Luffy's group about the past such as Kouzuki Oden bringing order to Kuri, the day of his demise, and Toki sending Kin'emons group and Momonosuke to the future.","Luffy and his friends are rattled after Kin'emon informs them that he and his fellow samurai have traveled across time from Wano, two decades in the past. Kin'emon enlightens them, and begins recounting the history of the kingdom, as well as Momonosuke's father, Kouzuki Oden. 
Many years ago, the Flower Capital was ruled by Kouzuki Sukiyaki. Oden was an unruly ronin, who was banished from the city for his violent inclinations. Free to roam wherever he chose, Oden happened upon at the lawless region of Wano, a valley notorious for its brutality and desecration day in and day out. The young Oden appeared on the scene, cutting down the mass of bandits and other troublemakers swarming the village. He sought to challenge the criminals' boss, Ashura Doji, to a duel. After coming out on top, the horde of bandits then recognized Oden as their new leader. Oden then put his underlings to work, rebuilding the village, farming crops, bridging communities, and bringing new life the region that would become the present day Bakura Town. By Sukiyaki's appointment, Oden became the daimyo of Kuri, despite his disorderly behavior.
Meanwhile, Inuarashi is reminiscing about Oden as well, recalling a time when his younger self, along with Nekomamushi, were castaways on the shore of Kuri. Oden rescued to duo from persecution at hands of the locals, and took them under his wing. Inuarashi weeps for his master's outgoing kindness, acclaiming that Oden's heroism was respected by Whitebeard himself, and even Gol D. Roger.
Zoro emerges victorious over his battle with the giant tiger, when a nearby fishing pier grabs his attention. As the samurai lament over the memories of their lost master, the Straw Hat Pirates are brimming with anger aimed at the Beasts Pirates and the scheming Orochi. On the night the mutiny had taken place 20 year prior, Oden fought to his last breath, before he ultimately fell to his executioners. Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, Kiku, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi fled from the site of their execution, and headed for Oden's castle in order to save Oden's children, and his wife, Kouzuki Toki. The two minks were tragically apprehended, but the samurai had no time to look back. They approached the scorching castle, slashing through the monstrous assailants.
Oden's castle was on the brink of collapse, but the four samurai arrived to find Toki, Momonosuke, and his sister alive, trapped by the fire. To his shock, Toki declined Kin'emon's attempt to help her escape. She commanded the four to make off with Momonosuke, and leave to the future. Without much time to explain, Toki claimed to possess the powers of the Toki Toki no Mi, and that she had the ability to send them forward in time. She had used this power on herself many times before, but decided that she must surrender herself to fate then and there. Though Kin'emon did not fully understand, he pledged that he and the other samurai would avenge the Kouzuki Family, and restore justice to the Wano Oden worked tirelessly to forge. Momonosuke cries out for his mother, and without admonition, he and the four samurai appear above the castle's torched remains, in abrupt daylight.
Witnessing the sight of their own graves, and discovering the massive industrialization of the country they once knew, Kin'emon and the others came to terms with the fact that they have indeed traveled into the future. They were made unpleasantly aware of the kingdom's sorry state, and how Oden's legacy had been slandered with hateful propaganda. Amidst all this regrettable change however, Kin'emon found that there was a collection of citizens who remained loyal to Oden, and offered themselves to help defend the Kouzuki Family's honor.","Kouzuki Toki (flashback; silhouette), Kin'emon, Brook, Nami, Monkey D.

At the shogun's castle, CP0 attempts to negotiate with Orochi.","Zoro goes to a gambling house where he plays an odds-and-evens game with dice. He wins, earning an impressive sum. However, the other Straw Hats do not know where he is, so they consider him missing.
At the construction company, Franky is reprimanded by his boss Minatomo for arriving to work late. Franky asks for the blueprints for Kaidou's mansion, but Minatomo states that he had pawned them away a decade ago. After starting a fight, Franky is fired and leaves to go to the pawn shop.

Episode 959,The Promised Port! Wano Country Arc Act 3 Begins,"January 24, 2021","25 years ago, Kouzuki Oden parted ways with the Roger Pirates after their voyage to Laugh Tale, seeking to open Wano Country's borders. In the present, Orochi heads to Onigashima from Port Habu to partake in the Fire Festival, and as twilight draws near, the Nine Red Scabbards reach Port Tokage. However, none of their allies are there, and they cannot get in contact with anyone, including the Straw Hats.","25 years ago, the Roger Pirates had a drunken feast at their ship. Kouzuki Oden expressed his appreciation for being able to join Gol D. Roger on his voyage. Silvers Rayleigh, Shanks, and Buggy offered to help him in his quest to open Wano Country's borders, but Oden replied that he should handle this alone; he was confident that with the help of his retainers, he could become shogun and accomplish his goal.
In the present day, Act 3 of the Wano Country Arc begins. In Port Habu in Hakumai, Orochi boards a ship headed for the Fire Festival in Onigashima. He drinks heavily in celebration. The people in the Flower Capital also celebrate passionately.
Meanwhile, at the rendezvous point, Tokage Port, Momonosuke and the Scabbards find out that not only it is storming heavily, but their ships and allies are nowhere to be seen, and Kin'emon desperately tries calling their allies on the Tanishi. However, he cannot reach any of them, and his pleas quickly become desperate before Ashura Doji silences him.
Rewinding back to two days before the Fire Festival, the alliance members moved to conclude their preparations and head for Port Tokage. After overseeing the completion of the ship restoration in Port Itachi, Franky and Usopp headed to Amigasa Village to reunite with their crew, leaving the ships in the care of the Musketeers and Wano carpenters.
In the Prisoner Mine, Hyougoro oversaw the prisoners collecting all the weapons they could find while Cho acquired the weapons stored in Ringo. Jibuemon talked with some allies about making sure they all moved to Port Tokage discreetly, and they agreed even though Orochi and many of his officials would have already left for Onigashima.
In Amigasa Village, Hitetsu gave the Straw Hats some kabuto armor, and Luffy, Chopper, and Brook were excited to don it. Sanji asks Zoro why he does not want to wear the armor, to which he replies the armor will slow him down. Then, he finally taunts Zoro with his higher bounty causing Zoro to unleash Enma. Both of them had a fight before getting whacked by Nami. Eventually, Nami and Robin discussed with Carrot, Wanda, Shishilian, Concelot, and Giovanni about the full moon that would be present during the final battle, and they hoped that the minks could use Sulong and that Nekomamushi and the Guardians would arrive on time. Meanwhile, Luffy looked out toward the ocean, noting that Jinbe had not yet arrived despite Big Mom being here. After finding out what had happened with Jinbe, Zoro assured Luffy that the fish-man would come if he was still alive.
In Okobore Town, however, the citizens were confronted by Holed'em, who revealed that the Paradise Farm was still being stolen from despite him burning down the Mt. Atama Thieves' hideout. The citizens deduced that the Nine Red Scabbards had likely stolen the food if the reports of their return were accurate, though decided to not say a word about it. Tsuru then came and told Holed'em that she would guide him to the food, as she wanted to help her husband Kin'emon and the Kouzuki Family's plan. However, the other citizens stopped her by claiming aloud that they had eaten the stolen food, shocking her and angering Holed'em.
Back again, in the present, at Tokage Port, as the Scabbards start to lose hope of their allies showing up, Inuarashi finds a boat that looks intact and prepares to sail out to Onigashima alone. Momonosuke says that they should change the date of their rendezvous and Shinobu attempts to stop Kin'emon and the rest of the Scabbards from going towards Onigashima, however, Kin'emon declines.

A flashback to many years ago begins. Back then, Oden was a well-known troublemaker. A younger Kin'emon takes a baby white boar from some thugs and brings it to the Flower Capital to gain money. However, the boar's parent, the Mountain God, arrives at the capital and wreaks havoc.","To the great shock of the Nine Red Scabbards, no one shows up to Tokage Port to sail out to Onigashima. The day before, Orochi decided to sabotage the operation before it could happen. He bombed the Thousand Sunny as well as all bridges leading to the port. He also destroys the port itself. The Nine Red Scabbards decide that they must sail out to Onigashima, with or without their allies. They prepare to go.
They remember Oden's legacy. A delinquent from a young age, Oden committed several atrocious acts, such as starting what would be known as the Harem War, where he clashed with several other samurai whose women he stole. When he turned eighteen, he was disavowed from his father.
The future Nine Red Scabbards also steal to survive. Kin'emon attempts to steal a baby boar and Denjiro swindles a merchant for a pot. However, the baby boar's parent, a giant dubbed the mountain god, goes on a rampage around town in search of its child.

After staying with Shimotsuki Yasuie for a time, Oden decides to travel to Kuri. Along the way, Oden is also joined by Izou, Kikunojo, Kanjuro, and Raizo. Oden eventually arrives at Kuri and prepares to fight the bandits there.","The giant boar, named the Mountain God, rampages around town in search of its baby. Upon hearing that the Mountain God swallowed Tsurujo, Kin'emon decides to battle it head on. Despite having stabbed the beast, Kin'emon is knocked back into the ground and defeated. Oden then appears and uses his sword, slicing the beast cleanly in half. Although there were no casualties from the incident, a quarter of the town was destroyed by the Mountain God.
Oden is blamed for the incident, and he receives the notice of disavowal from his father, exiling him from the capital. Kin'emon and Denjiro decide to follow and serve him.
Oden stays at Hakumai and meets the region's daimyo, Yasuie, and his servant, Orochi. He ends up destroying the room he stays in, steals money from the safe and then leaves to travel around the country. He plans to end up at Kuri, the country's lawless region, where he would restore order to the region.

They quickly got into a swordfight, which appeared to be at a standstill. However, by the time Oden's followers came to his aid, he had already emerged victorious and defeated Ashura. Oden would take him in as one of his followers.
After liberating Kuri from Ashura, Oden would start building structures and towns in the area, turning what was once an uncivilized, rough terrain into an officially-recognized province of Wano Country, with Oden as its first daimyo and his followers as his official retainers. Sukiyaki repealed his disavowal and accepted him as his son again. The Kouzuki Family also formed an alliance with the Mink Tribe.
Inuarashi, Nekomamushi and Kawamatsu washed ashore as children, but the people, mistaking them for monsters, attempted to burn them at the stake. Oden arrived just in time to rescue them. After welcoming them into his palace and feeding them oden stew, they explained that their ship sunk and they washed ashore. Oden accepted them into the country and they became Oden's loyal retainers like the others.
Oden's followers then raided Hakumai and attempted to steal money from Yasuie, but they were all captured and brought to the daimyo. Surprisingly, Yasuie allows them to keep the money they stole, and also faithfully gave his own savings. Oden and his followers then used the money to pay for books and education, learned proper manners and trained to become strong warriors. Although they originally gained a reputation of being ruffians, they eventually became respected, high-class individuals.
The God Valley Incident occurred, leading to the defeat and dissolution of the Rocks Pirates. Although their captain was killed, the crew split up and formed their own pirate crews. Among these powerful pirates was Edward Newgate, who became known as Whitebeard.

Whitebeard gives Oden a test: if he can hold onto a chain being dragged by the ship for three days, he will be allowed into the crew. Although Oden almost completed this challenge, he abandons it to save a woman in distress.","Oden went to the shore and instantly started a battle with Whitebeard, but was instantly defeated. Oden asked Whitebeard to let him join his crew, but he refuses, stating that he was not a loyal person and would therefore not be good at serving someone else. Kin'emon was also opposed to Oden setting sail because he had his duties as a daimyo.
Two weeks passed and Whitebeard's men finished repairing his ship, the Moby Dick. Whitebeard decided to set sail at night to prevent Oden from joining, but Oden snuck out and nevertheless attempted to board the ship. He held onto a chain tied to the ship's mast and was carried along with the ship. Izou pursued Oden and held onto him, trying to prevent him from settting sail.
Marco rescued Izou from the water and carried him onboard. Oden, however, was not rescued and was dragged through the rough waters, crashing into rocks along the way. Whitebeard promised Oden that he would be allowed into the crew if he held onto the chain for three days. Oden accepted the challenge as he rode down the waterfall, got eaten by a fish, and was dragged through icy waters.
Three days passed and one hour remained. Oden held onto the chain strongly but his body was greatly swollen from water collision. However, he heard the screams of a woman being harassed on a nearby island, Amatsuki Toki.

On the next day, they are confronted by the kidnappers and their leader, Karma. Whitebeard intervenes and knocks out Karma. Whitebeard accepts Oden into his crew because of his selflessness.
Toki, Izou, and the stowaways Inuarashi and Nekomamushi become part of Whitebeard's crew as well. Oden travels to various places and has many eventful experiences. Oden and Toki also has a son together and the infant is given the name Kouzuki Momonosuke.","Toki took care of Oden as he recovered from his swelling. Toki explained that she dreamed of going to Wano Country. However, the next day they are confronted by the thugs from earlier, the Takotopus Pirates led by their captain Karma. However, Whitebeard suddenly appeared and knocked out Karma with a single hit. The other thugs were scared off at the sight of an emperor.
Since Oden gave up his ambition to save a woman, Whitebeard allowed Oden onto his ship. Izou, Toki, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were also accepted in. Oden would prove to be one of the most violently powerful members of the crew, as he sunk an enemy ship before his crew got the chance to plunder it. Travelling across several distant lands, he recorded all his adventures in his journal.
Oden got close with Toki, who explained that her parents were born in Wano Country so she wanted to visit the country. Eventually, during Oden's second year in the crew, they had a child and named him Momonosuke. He became a wanted pirate overseas, and when Whitebeard decided to segment his crew into divisions, Oden became the commander of the second division.
Back at Wano Country, the shogun Sukiyaki falls critically ill and had to select an heir. Since Oden was absent, he decided to appoint Kurozumi Orochi as his proxy. During the crew's travels, Whitebeard creates five divisions, appointing Oden as the commander of the second, much to his dismay. The next morning, sun shining, they are haggled by Teach as a child orphan to join their crew. With that being a soft spot for Whitebeard, he lets the child onboard.

Roger ensues.","Orochi became Oden's proxy as he was at sea, but the other daimyos suspected him because he was a member of the Kurozumi Family. Orochi's past is revealed. In his childhood, he and his family became hunted because of what his grandfather did. Orochi hid away in the forest and found a desolate cabin. Inside there was an old man and woman, Semimaru and Higurashi.
Higurashi explained the truth about Orochi's grandfather. Since the Kouzuki shogun was infertile, daimyos from the Shimotsuki, Kurozumi, Uzuki, Amatsuki, and Fugetsu Families all fought to be the next heir. Orochi's grandfather attempted to take over by assassinating the other daimyos, but the Kouzuki shogun finally managed to give birth to an heir, Sukiyaki. The assassination plot was exposed, Orochi's grandfather committed suicide, and the people grew to despise the Kurozumi name.
Orochi deduced that all his miseries stemmed from Sukiyaki's being born, and that he would have become shogun if Sukiyaki was not born. Higurashi revealed she was also a member of the Kurozumi Family and that she had the power to transform into other people. She gave Orochi a Devil Fruit, allowing him to transform into an eight-headed serpent. Orochi plotted to usurp the throne.
Orochi needed to collect funding to buy weapons. He stole money from Yasuie while working undercover as a servant and asked Oden for loans without paying him back. Higurashi then disguised herself as Oden to convince the shogun to let Orochi into the palace, where he became the shogun's faithful servant. Years later, Higurashi disguised herself as Sukiyaki, pretended to fall ill and spread news that Sukiyaki died of the illness, allowing Orochi to rise to power.
Overseas, Oden reached his fourth year under the Whitebeard Pirates, giving birth to another child, Hiyori. They approached an island being plundered by Gold Roger.

Roger meets with Whitebeard and Oden, amazed that Oden could read a Poneglyph. Roger originally thought that he had reached the end of the Grand Line on Lodestar Island, but since his Log Pose stopped working on the island, he deduced that there was a final island after that. He heard that the location of the final island was written in the Poneglyphs. Roger asked to borrow Oden for a year to reach the final island.
Whitebeard originally refused, but Oden agreed, determined to find the final island of the Grand Line. He decided to part ways with Whitebeard and join the Roger Pirates with Toki and his baby children. Izou stayed with Whitebeard while Inuarashi and Nekomamushi snuck onboard Roger's ship as stowaways.

They continued on their travels and left Skypiea, using an octopus balloon to get the ship down safely.
There was a Road Poneglyph in both Zou and Wano Country, and Roger had already gotten a copy of another Poneglyph belonging to Big Mom, so the Roger Pirates had already located three of the four Poneglyphs needed to find the final island.

Oden broke into the palace and attempted to attack him, but Semimaru used his Devil Fruit ability to create a barrier protecting Orochi. Higurashi, who was nearby, revealed that she, too, had a Devil Fruit ability, which allowed her to disguise herself as Sukiyaki and hand the throne to Orochi. The real Sukiyaki never intended to give the throne to Orochi, and did not die from illness like how the news said he did. Citizens outside cheered on Oden to save the country, but they were struck with poisoned arrows that rained down from the sky.
Oden reclaimed the throne, but every week he stripped down naked in the courtyard and danced like a fool, singing about oden stew. For this weird behaviour, the citizens started believing him to be a fool and stopped respecting him. The children also made fun of him. Oden did not mind the ridicule, but found in the newspaper that Roger had been executed. Overseas, Whitebeard also receives the news, reflecting on the last time they met, where Roger told him all about the mysterious Will of D.
Previously, Roger was taken to his birthplace, Loguetown, to be executed by impalement. Doflamingo, Buggy, Shanks, Mihawk, Crocodile, Moria and Dragon all witnessed the event. In his last moments, one person asked Roger where his treasure was. As his final words, Roger said that he hid the treasure for others to find.

Episode 971,Raid! Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards,"April 25, 2021",Orochi starts taking power of the country backed up by Kaidou. Oden and his men travel to Udon to face Kaidou head-on.,"Five years passed since Oden's return to Wano Country and nothing much had changed. He had garnered a reputation of being the silly lord for his naked dances, but the other daimyos and his retainers supported him unconditionally.
However, Orochi made his move. He wanted to start building weapon factories in Kuri to transform the country into the leader of the weapons industry. Orochi captured Hyougoro, who refused to serve him, and sent him to prison. Those who attempted to aid Hyougoro, including his wife, were shot. Upon hearing the news, Oden decided that Orochi had become a great threat and must be stopped. Because of their unwavering loyalty to the country, Oden's retainers were named the Nine Red Scabbards.
Kaidou's men were strangely prepared for the attack, almost as if there was a spy within Oden's retainers. The Nine Red Scabbards faced off against hundreds of the Beasts Pirates as well as Kaidou himself in his dragon form. Kaidou revealed that the promises Orochi made to Oden were entirely a lie. The battle begins, and despite being greatly outnumbered, the Nine Red Scabbards started strong fighting off the Beasts Pirates. While Oden's men faced off, Toki watched over Momonosuke and Hiyori back in Kuri, pressured by Yasuie to keep them safe at all costs.","Gecko Moria, Kaidou, Kouzuki Oden, Shimotsuki Yasuie, Kawamatsu, Nekomamushi, Inuarashi, Kikunojo, Raizo, Kin'emon, Kouzuki Hiyori, Kouzuki Momonosuke, Kouzuki Toki, Hyougoro's wife, Hyougoro, Fujin, Raijin, Kazekage, Fukurokuju, Hanzo, Kurozumi Orochi, Kurozumi Semimaru, Kurozumi Higurashi, Denjiro, Kanjuro, Ashura Doji, Tsugaru Umi, Edward Newgate (fantasy), Gol D.

Episode 972,The End of the Battle! Oden vs. Kaidou!,"May 2, 2021","Kaidou defeats Oden at Udon and the retainers are captured. They are sentenced to be executed by boiling, where Oden suggests a challenge.","To the disappointment of Kaidou, King and Queen, Oden and his retainers fought strongly against Kaidou's men, even having Shinobu join them. Kaidou decided to intervene personally with his ""Bolo Breath"" attack, but Oden remained unharmed by the attack. The two fought each other one-on-one while Oden's retainers battled King and Queen. Kaidou got the upper hand, knocking Oden into the fiery ground below.
Oden got up, ready to face him again. He coated his swords with Ryuo and leaps toward Kaidou. Although Kaidou's flames nearly knock him back down, through sheer willpower he braves the flames and slashes into Kaidou's body, being the first person to ever cut Kaidou. He prepares to finish off Kaidou while he is in his human form.
However, Higurashi disguised herself as Momonosuke while a Beasts Pirate held her at knifepoint. This distracted Oden just enough for Kaidou to critically wound him off guard. Ashura and Kin'emon attempted to aid him, but were defeated by King and Queen. Oden collapsed, earning victory for the Beasts Pirates. The fires set during the battle raged through the Udon forest for five days until the rain finally put it out.
Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards were all jailed in the Flower Capital, with only Shinobu being spared. Previously, Oden denied allegiance to her so that she would not be arrested with the others. Eventually, the Nine Red Scabbards' verdict was released, and they would be executed by boiling in three days.
Three days passed and the day of the execution arrived. The public event became a big spectacle since execution by boiling was rare. As Oden walks the plank into the pot, one of the executioners slipped on oil, fell into the pot, and suffered an excruciating death. Just before Oden entered the pot, he suggested a wager to Orochi: if he and his retainers could survive a set amount of time in the pot, they would be set free.","Kouzuki Oden, Kin'emon, Denjiro, Kikunojo, Shinobu, Fukurokuju (fantasy), Sarutobi (fantasy), Daikoku (fantasy), Hanzo (fantasy), Kurozumi Orochi, Raizo, Kouzuki Toki, Kouzuki Hiyori, Shimotsuki Yasuie, Kouzuki Momonosuke, Kaidou, Queen, King, Nekomamushi, Inuarashi, Kawamatsu, Ashura Doji, Izou (flashback), Kanjuro (flashback), Pandaman (flashback), Kurozumi Higurashi, Tsuru, Banzaburo, Yamato",
Episode 973,Boiled to Death - Oden's One-hour Struggle,"May 9, 2021","Orochi accepts the challenge and Oden must enter the pot for one hour. Shinobu, who is in the crowd, explains Oden's naked dances.","Although Orochi initially scoffed at Oden's suggestion, Kaidou accepted the challenge, agreeing to release the retainers if they survived one hour in the pot. Oden entered the pot, already being singed by the boiling oil. The other retainers run on the plank to also get in, but Oden lifts the plank up, allowing his retainers to sit safe from the boiling oil. Kaidou allowed him to do this, since they were technically in the pot.
Less than a minute passed and Oden already struggled to lift the plank. It forced Oden to stand on the bottom of the pot, and his veins burst from the pressure. Shinobu watched the event from the sidelines, and attacked a man who called Oden a ""silly lord."" She publicly called out the oppressive shogun Orochi.
While in the pot, Oden reflected on what Orochi told him back at the palace. Orochi revealed that he held an immense hatred for Wano Country for humiliating his family. Since his grandfather's assassination plans were exposed and he committed seppuku, the remaining members of the Kurozumi Family were hunted down, beaten and killed by the other people. He intended to destroy the country through his oppressive regime as an act of vengeance for his family's life of suffering.
Shinobu reveals more, as she was hiding in the ceiling when it happened. Orochi kidnapped hundreds of citizens meant as tributes to Kaidou. At that point, Orochi offered Oden a bargain; Orochi would cease the kidnappings and he and Kaidou would leave Wano Country after five years. In exchange, Oden had to dance naked in the Flower Capital every week while being humiliated by Orochi. Oden decided he had no choice as he had no chance against Kaidou.
Shinobu finishes her story, stating that Oden's naked dances were in an effort to release the kidnapped citizens. Although he was not appreciated then, the citizens witnessing the execution were touched by Oden's sacrifices.","Kouzuki Toki, Kouzuki Hiyori, Kaidou, Kouzuki Oden, Kurozumi Orochi, Raizo, Kikunojo, Denjiro, Kawamatsu, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, Ashura Doji, Shinobu, Fukurokuju, Hanzo, Sarutobi, Daikoku, Kurozumi Higurashi (flashback), Kurozumi Semimaru (flashback), Hana (flashback), Kouzuki Momonosuke",

However, Oden knows that he will not survive the execution, so he tells his retainers to open up the country in his name. Meanwhile, Fukurokuju confronts Shinobu for telling everyone the truth, but Shinobu denounces the Orochi Oniwabanshu and pledges loyalty to the Nine Red Scabbards. Thirty minutes passed and Oden still stood strong, so Orochi ordered his men to further increase the temperature.
Ten minutes remained and Orochi became increasingly frustrated that Oden had not yet died. Through pure willpower, Oden pushed through the final ten minutes and completed the challenge. Despite this, Orochi decided to break his promises, and the firing squad pointed their guns on Oden anyway.
After telling his retainers to open up the country for him, he threw the plank away from the execution area, allowing his retainers to flee to Kuri. They remembered their happy times with Oden as they tearfully ran away. Kaidou mentioned that he killed Higurashi, but then took out his pistol and shot Oden in the head.

Episode 975,The Castle on Fire! The Fate of the Kouzuki Clan!,"May 23, 2021",The Nine Red Scabbards make it to the castle and are transported twenty years into the future. Toki stays behind but is killed delivering a prophecy.,"News of Oden's death spread to Toki, who reflected on her final moments with Oden. Before he left to confront Kaidou, Oden entrusted Toki with a scroll to be opened if he died in the battle. The scroll prophecized that in twenty years, someone would arrive to save Wano Country.
Pursued by Beasts Pirates, the Nine Red Scabbards ran through the forest to escape back to Oden's castle. Ashura and Denjiro were forced to stay behind to battle the Beasts Pirates.
Kaidou's men fired flaming arrows at Oden's castle, setting it ablaze with Toki, Momonosuke and Hiyori still inside. Momonosuke reflected on his time with Oden. As the Roger Pirates floated down from Skypiea, they got a view of the ocean from above. Hiyori also remembered when Oden listened to her playing the shamisen. Hiyori learned the song Moon Princess. Oden joked that the song should be played at his funeral, frightening Hiyori.
Kaidou entered the castle looking to kill Momonosuke. He confronted Momonosuke, but since he was too cowardly to cooperate, he lost interest, leaving him to die in the mansion. He transforms into his dragon form and leaves.
Most of the Nine Red Scabbards made it to the castle, except for Ashura and Denjiro. Toki transported the Nine Red Scabbards along with Momonosuke twenty years into the future. She entrusted Hiyori to be raised by Kawamatsu while she rode away to Bakura Town. At the city gate, she announced the prophecy given to her by Oden to the crowd just before she was shot down by an enemy sniper.","Kurozumi Orochi, Kaidou, Sarutobi, Fukurokuju, Hanzo, Daikoku, Kouzuki Momonosuke, Kouzuki Hiyori, Banzaburo, Kouzuki Toki, Kouzuki Oden (flashback), Raizo, Kawamatsu, Kikunojo, Denjiro, Nekomamushi, Ashura Doji, Kanjuro, Inuarashi, Kin'emon, Shinobu, Jaki (silhouette), King, Silvers Rayleigh (flashback), Sunbell (flashback), Gol D.

Transitioning to the present day, Kin'emon's troops are prepared to storm Onigashima.","Orochi took a bath and complained about it being too cold, despite the water being scalding hot. He expressed his frustration that Oden's retainers had not been caught. Meanwhile, Oden's remaining followers were devastated by the deaths. Ashura, who survived the encounter in the forest with injuries, reflected on the prophecy given by Toki just before her death. Kawamatsu attempted to cheer up a grieving Hiyori, but to no avail.
Denjiro had a meltdown while hidden in a secluded wooden cabin. In the end, this transformed him into a cold and cynical person under the new name, Kyoshiro. He created a new yakuza group and very begrudgingly pledged allegiance to Orochi to work undercover. At night, he became the infamous thief Ushimitsu Kozo.
Eventually, Hiyori ran away out of guilt for Kawamatsu. She showed up at the brothel owned by Kyoshiro, who immediately recognized her. Kyoshiro took her into the brothel and raised her, transforming her into an oiran by the name of Komurasaki. She was to carry fake blood at all times so she could fake her death when needed.
Twenty years nearly passed and the Fire Festival was fast approaching. Paranoid of the Nine Red Scabbards' return, Orochi secures the country. He mentions a spy among them that was allied with Kaidou the entire time. This unknown spy was a member of the Kurozumi Family. He was originally part of a theatre troupe but his parents were killed in front of him. The spy met with Orochi and Higurashi, who tasked him with working undercover as one of Oden's retainers.
The retainers who were transported to the future attempted to sail out to Zou, but their ship wrecked in stormy waters, and Raizo got separated from the group. Then, in Dressrosa, Momonosuke boarded on the wrong ship and also got separated. Kanjuro sacrificed himself there and allowed himself to get captured, allowing Kin'emon to escape Dressrosa and pursue the ship to Punk Hazard. Unfortunately, he encountered Law, who cut him into pieces. He would be reassembled and reunited with the others thanks to the Straw Hat Pirates' efforts.

He also turns out to be just a drawing, with his real self at the port capturing Momonosuke. Luffy, Law and Kid arrive and prepare to attack the enemy ships.","None of the people who promised to arrive at Tokage Port arrive, not even Luffy. The Nine Red Scabbards realize that since they took over Udon, Kaidou's forces will be informed of their presence soon. So, they have no choice but to set sail for Onigashima immediately, getting on a small rowboat to traverse the stormy waters.
This marks the third time that their plans have been leaked to Kaidou's forces. Kin'emon deduces that there must be a spy among Oden's retainers. Kaidou hinted at a spy before but Kin'emon did not believe him until now.
Kanjuro makes the shocking revelation that he was the traitor. Being hunted for being a member of the Kurozumi Family his whole life, he decided to infiltrate Oden's retainers, sending confidential information to Orochi. Back in Zou, he told Jack that Raizo was located there, and he told Orochi about the new rendezvous point given by Yasuie. Orochi sabotaged the mission by bombing all connecting bridges, as well as the Thousand Sunny.
Now aware of the Nine Red Scabbards' whereabouts, Kaidou's battleships are all lined up, ready to sink their rowboat. Kin'emon cuts down Kanjuro, only to reveal that it is only a drawing of him. The real Kanjuro is still at the port. He restrains Shinobu with drawn snakes and captures Momonosuke. Since Kanjuro was not on the ship, the Beasts Pirates bombard it with cannonballs.
The Straw Hats finally appear, having managed to repair the Thousand Sunny in time. The Thousand Sunny strikes the enemy ships with cannonballs. Law's submarine also appears from underwater, and so does Kid's ship from the opposite side.

Usopp and Zoro repel the attack. Meanwhile, back at Tokage Port, Kanjuro is surprised to see the pirates being present there, having reported to Orochi about the changes of Kin'emon's plan.
Previously, two Gifters bombed the Thousand Sunny on Orochi's orders. The Straw Hats, who were located in Amigasa Village, heard the explosion at the coast. Luckily, the ship was built out of a durable wood and was unharmed by the explosion. However, the sails were burned and had to be repaired.
The Gifters then reveal how they prevented the rest of the allies from getting to Tokage Port; they bombed the ships docked at the port, as well as all connecting bridges. The Gifters also reveal that the Beasts Pirates have formed an alliance with the Big Mom Pirates. Feeling satisfied, they decided to keep firing their cannons.
Luffy, Law and Kid board the enemy ship. They get into a disagreement over who should destroy the ship. The three captains together go on to destroy the ship. Luffy defeats the eagle Gifter and Law takes out the butterfly Gifter.

He reveals that he is Denjiro, and he has been working undercover for Orochi for the last twenty years. He also explains that he freed 1200 prisoners from the Flower Capital, all of whom were willing to join the alliance.
Then, Denjiro explains the new flyer given by Yasuie. What the lines really meant was to remove the middle syllables of ""Habuminato"" (Habu Port), getting ""Hato"" (wharf). The correct rendezvous point was at the wharf of Habu Port all along.
Furthermore, although Orochi bombed the connecting bridges between regions, the allied forces had already crossed the bridge before then. Their ships were safely hidden away at the Habu wharf. Denjiro commends Kin'emon for cleverly misinforming the other Scabbards to mislead the spy Kanjuro, unaware that Kin'emon had actually misunderstood the message himself.
Kanjuro laments having let the alliance get away but attempts to escape with Momonosuke by drawing a crane. The drawing is surprisingly good, as he had only pretended to be a bad artist.

Momonosuke is initially too afraid due to the height, but remembers Luffy encouraging him back in Zou.

The allied fleet starts to near Onigashima. Shishillian leads the Minks and Hyougoro leads the samurai. The allies gather in a circle on Law's submarine and Kin'emon discusses the plan. Onigashima is an island surrounded on all sides by mountains except for a single passage at the front, which is guarded at a torii gate. The castle, shaped like a skull, has a back entrance that could be entered, being less heavily-guarded than the front entrance. The allies would enter the front gate, use the mountain paths to reach the back entrance, and crash Kaidou's banquet to assassinate him.
Law proposes a better plan. Luffy and Kid would burst through the front gate as decoys. A second decoy would be sent around the mountain paths to the back entrance. The other allies would sneak in by water with Law's submarine, then be teleported into the island with Law's ability. Kin'emon and Denjiro would each lead a decoy group going around the castle.
The Straw Hats stop by an enemy fortress just in front of Onigashima where the its torii gate is located. The Thousand Sunny attaches its anchor to the gate before the Straw Hats set foot onto the island. All of them, except for Nami, Usopp and Chopper, decimate the enemy troops.","Jinbe, Monkey D.

He congratulates Chopper for holding off Queen enough for him to arrive, and tells him to continue trusting in Luffy, before handing him Zoro and telling to take care of the injured swordsman. Sanji resolves to fight Queen, and the samurai look on in awe, noting how he doesn't give up despite his captain having been defeated.

Watching Zoro fight, Hyougoro and Kawamatsu remember someone from way back.","King intercepts Chopper's group which is carrying Zoro. Sanji sees this and tries to defend against King but is shot by Queen's laser. Marco manages to block King's attack and the two square off. Marco talks of a race that could ignite themselves and once lived on top of the Red Line and says that he didn't expect to meet one in King.
King and Queen are prepared to fight Marco, but he surrenders seeing that Zoro has recovered from his injuries, thanks to the drug given to him by Miyagi. Zoro deflects Queen's attack. He and Sanji then proceed to attack the two All-Stars.
Marco spaces out as he watches the fight. He recalls his conversation with Whitebeard about how Mary Geoise used to be the Land of Gods. He is then saved by Izou when some Beasts Pirates shoot at Marco while he is in a daze.
During their fight, Sanji notices something different in his body from when he put on his Raid Suit a while back. Queen notices this, too, as he claims that Sanji must also be a cyborg like Judge's other children since no human can ignite themselves unless he's a Lunarian.
As the four continue to battle, Hyougoro and Kawamatsu notice Zoro's similarities with the former Daimyo of Ringo, Shimotsuki Ushimaru, who was a decendant of the God of the Blade, Shimotsuki Ryuma―from the way he stands, his one eye, down to his swordplay. They feel that the fact that he returned Shusui to Wano was fate.

A large number of Beasts Pirates quickly move towards the Live Floor where Sanji, Zoro, King and Queen are fighting. Hyougoro and Kawamatsu see this and stop them from interfering with the fight. Meanwhile, Franky defeats Sasaki and fends off some Beasts Pirates. However, he runs out of cola so Bepo, Penguin, and Shachi step in.
On the second floor of the castle, Nami, Usopp, and Tama are riding on Speed's back, with Zeus following close by. They are running away from Beasts Pirates when a crocodile Gifter blocks their way. This forces Speed to accelerate, which causes Usopp to fall off her back.
On the same floor, Law and Kid are battling with Big Mom. Her Supreme King Haki causes a large number of Beasts Pirates to lose consciousness, which saves Usopp from their attacks. Usopp bluffs about causing the surge of Haki and urges the remaining conscious Beasts Pirates to join him.
On the third floor, Brook is carrying an unconscious Robin inside the burning floor. On the fourth floor, Jinbe and Heat are also fighting Beasts Pirates. Meanwhile, at the rooftop, Yamato barely manages to keep Kaidou preoccupied while waiting for Luffy to return.
In the Treasure Repository, Jack and Inuarashi are still engaged in battle. Jack seems to have the upper hand since Inuarashi is indoors and unable to use his Sulong form. However, using the memory of Jack's transgressions against him, he gets a surge of energy to toss Jack over his shoulder, which breaks a wall leading to a portion of the castle where the roof was blown off. Now with the moon visible, Inuarashi transforms into his Sulong form. Outside, Nekomamushi faces Perospero, vowing to avenge Pedro's death. He, too, transforms into a Sulong.
In Tokage Port, Caribou and the other Heart Pirates see a large dragon and are frightened as it resembles Kaidou. Luffy approaches the dragon, knowing that it is actually Momonosuke.

Backed into a corner, Yamato remembers three great swordsmen who he met when he was a child. Their stunning choice for the future of the Land of Wano encourages Yamato.","Luffy rides on Momonusuke's back and they start flying towards Kaidou. However, being afraid of heights and having realized that they have been flying, Momonosuke comes crashing down.
Meanwhile, Yamato and Kaidou continue to fight. Yamato remembers the first time he saw Oden and how the latter's sacrifice to save his retainers touched him as a young child. This caused the young Yamato to rampage around the castle. Beasts Pirates tried to restrain him, but he inadvertently used Supreme King Haki and knocked out most of them. Ultimately, the men were able to restrain him, and Kaidou went to investigate the commotion caused by his son.
When Yamato declared his love for Oden and declared himself to be Oden, Kaidou chained him and locked him up inside the Sacred Cave. Kaidou saw that his son had potential as he was able to knock out a number of his men using Haki. He told Yamato that he would be locked up for a month to cool his head, but if he changed his mind and joined his army, he would only need to call out from the cave's air hole in the ceiling. Yamato begged for his father to release him and to give him food since he was starving, but the emperor left him inside with three samurai who were also held captive. He also left the samurai their swords and a meal good for one person. It was then revealed that after Oden's execution, Daimyos from across the land stood up, with the three being the fiercest of them all.
Yamato was frightened at the thought of being left alone with the samurai who undoubtedly hated his father and could possibly take it out on him. However, the three samurai showed him nothing but kindness. They gave him the food, released him from his chains and trained him. When he saw that the samurai did not intend to harm him, he asked them to help him read Oden's journal which he found at the foot of Oden Castle.
The four read the journal together, which detailed Oden's travels from the time Roger asked Whitebeard to lend him Oden so he could reach the final island, up to when Roger's crew finally reached Laugh Tale. The journal detailed that in 20 years, the next era would come surging into the New World.
After 10 days, the samurai resolved to escape from the cave after seeing that Kaidou had no plans on releasing his own son. They also had no intention of rotting away inside the cave and while they would not be able to see the battle that would happen in 20 years, they were reassured knowing that people like Yamato would still be there to fight for Wano.
Back in the present, Yamato and Kaidou are still exchanging blows, with Yamato remembering that there were people who believed in him and accepted him. He demands to know why his father is taking away his freedom and the freedom of Wano. Kaidou answers that life isn't a series of simple questions and answers.","Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Yamato, in a hard battle against Kaidou, vows to survive until Luffy returns.","Luffy urges Momonosuke to fly and grows impatient, but the young master is crippled by his fear of heights.
Meanwhile, Yamato keeps Kaidou busy and the two continue to exchange blows. Yamato manages to make Kaidou bleed and is able to defend against Kaidou’s attacks using Mirror Mountain. He declares that he cannot die until Luffy comes back. Kaidou mocks Yamato’s resolve to protect Wano since Yamato is still his son so the people of Wano would never look at him as an ally. Kaidou further laughs at how Yamato doesn’t even have any friends.
Yamato disagrees as he remembers Ace who became his friend when the latter came to Wano. However, he also remembers when he was a child and one of Kaidou’s men helped him by giving him food when he was starving and a blanket when it was cold. This same pirate was executed when it was found out that he was helping Kaidou’s son. Kaidou points out that all of those who have been good to Yamato are all dead, including the samurai who were locked up with him in the Sacred Cave. Yamato rebuffs him, saying that they all died because he killed him, to which Kaidou replies that they were getting in the way of him educating his child.
Back in Tokage Port, Luffy pulls on Momonosuke’s dragon whiskers to force him to fly. Ultimately, Momonosuke takes flight towards Onigashima, albeit, with closed eyes due to fear. Flying blindly, Momonosuke crashes into the Skull Dome and flies through the castle, destroying walls and ceilings as he runs wild. He finally opens his eyes and finds his way to the rooftop where they see Kaidou and Yamato. Yamato prepares his Shinsoku Hakujaku technique and Luffy joins him in Gear 4, using his Snakeman: Jet Culverin technique.

Kaidou then emerges in his dragon form, unscathed. He is in disbelief that Luffy survived his previous injuries. He notices the pink dragon before him and demands to know who he is. Although frightened at first, Momonosuke answers that he is Kouzuki Momonosuke, the one who will become the Shogun of Wano.
Meanwhile, the people in the Flower Capital are oblivious to the events on Onigashima. Toko and Hitetsu join the festivities, with Toko remembering her adoptive father, Yasuie. Hitetsu, on the other hand, is reminded of his ward, Tama, who joined the fight in Onigashima, and worries for her safety.
A Mary reports updates on the rooftop to Queen which the others in the Skull Dome also hear. Elsewhere, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi seem to be winning their fights against Jack and Perospero, respectively. However, clouds slowly obstruct the full moon, and the minks are transformed out of their Sulong form. Deprived of their Sulong form and drained of their energy, the minks are overwhelmed by their opponents.
On the rooftop, Kaidou is about to breathe fire on Momonosuke, so Luffy urges the pink dragon to do the same. However, Momonosuke doubts he can produce such an attack so Luffy instead, tells him to bite the emperor. Momonosuke is horrified by this suggestion. Kaidou blasts him with successive Bolo Breaths which Momonosuke barely manages to evade. Momonosuke remembers what he and his family went through in the hands of Kaidou so he musters up the courage to sink his teeth onto the blue dragon.
An angered Kaidou is about to blast another attack when Luffy punches him in the face, preventing Kaidou from breathing fire. Luffy shouts his praises for Momonosuke which is heard all throughout Onigashima. Luffy tells Momonosuke that he just bit an Emperor of the Sea so there should be nothing left in the world that can scare him. Momonosuke realizes what he just did and concurs.","Monkey D.

Upon Luffy's instruction, Momonosuke and Yamato then leap off the edge of the island, aiming to stop Onigashima from moving.
The explosion created by Luffy and Kaidou, which revealed the full moon, allows Inuarashi and Nekomamushi to transform back into their Sulong forms. They both use Oden One Sword Style; Nekomamushi uses Neko Niko Ban to strike a powerful uppercut, defeating Perospero and shattering his candy arm.

Several fighters are hit by the slashes and one slash hits Queen's behind.
Zoro and King separate from the other fighters. Zoro slices off another piece of King's mask, revealing part of his scalp.

Killer's subordinates arrive to his aid, but Killer refuses to attack Hawkins. So, Hawkins decides to harm Kid himself by repeatedly slamming his head into the wall. The damage is redirected to Kid's head, proving especially disadvantageous to Kid due to his battle with Big Mom. When Killer declares that Kid will become the Pirate King, this angers Hawkins, causing him to ruthlessly beat Killer.
With a single attack, Killer slices off Hawkins' left arm. Because Kid lost his left arm prior, the attack leaves him totally unharmed. Instead, Hawkins loses his own arm. Killer pulls the straw doll out of Hawkins' severed arm and destroys it, undoing the damage dealt to Kid's body. Hawkins no longer has any people left to redirect damage to and is now completely vulnerable to attacks.

On his side are three Numbers: Inbi, Fuga and Zanki. Drake is uninterested by this offer, untrusting of Apoo.
Tama and her tamed Beasts Pirates try to escape the fire, but they come face-to-face with Kin'emon's lower body. Apparently, he survived his defeat at Kaidou's hands as he had already been bifurcated by Law. While his upper body remains in the attic attempting to wake up Kiku, his lower body looks for allies.

He fails to notice a lady calling to him for help and he only regains his senses when he sees the said lady on the floor bleeding and looking at him in terror. He rushes to help her, but she begs him not to come closer.
O-some, as the woman is called, rushes to a nearby room where other geishas have been hiding. Sanji again offers to help O-some, but the other women chastise him for hurting a defenseless woman. The women drive him outside their hiding place where he finds Queen who had been looking for him.
Sanji is shaken by the thought of possibly striking a woman. He comes to the realization that his mutation was brought about by his use of his Germa suit. He wonders if Luffy would rather have an unreliable crewmate who is helpless against women or a cruel and heartless warrior who is able to bring anybody's head when he's ordered. He ponders what the future Pirate King needs and decides to destroy his Germa suit.
Using a Den Den Mushi, Sanji calls Zoro, who is in the middle of his fight against King.

In the Treasure Repository, Orochi listens with excitement to the chaos brought about by Kazenbo, which was created to exact vengeance in the name of the Kurozami Clan. Suddenly, he hears a shamisen playing nearby. He is drawn to the sound which reminds him of his beloved Komurasaki.
Outside, a determined Momonosuke is frantically creating flame clouds to prevent Onigashima from crashing down onto the Flower Capital.
Zoro and King are still in battle. Zoro is overwhelmed by King's attacks which he deems to be unblockable. He notices the flames on King's back, and wonders out loud if this is an ability from his Devil Fruit. King hears this and answers that it is not a feature of the Pteranodon. Zoro attacks with Three Sword Style: Black Rope Dragon Twister but King easily overcomes this. Zoro is at a loss at how durable King is, noting that it must be because of his dinosaur Devil Fruit. King agrees but hints that it might also be because he is also a little unique. Zoro concludes that King's durability, wings, and flames are a feature of a tribe that is unknown to him. Zoro is knocked down and exhausted. All of a sudden, Zoro hears the sound of a shamisen which causes Enma to start draining his Haki and emaciate his arm.
Inside, Orochi crawls towards the shamisen player and sees Komurasaki alive and well. He cries out in tears while she greets him with a smile.","Eustass Kid, Charlotte Linlin, Napoleon, Trafalgar D.

King the Conflagration,"April 23, 2023","As Queen reveals to Sanji King's secret, elsewhere as he is struggling against King, Zoro realizes an important fact from his past.","Kazenbo continues to make its way down to the Armory. The Beast Pirates and samurai try in vain to stop its descent. Yamato realizes that the flame spectre is moving through walls and that it will be reaching the Armory soon. He urgently moves faster, enlisting the help of the Numbers, Fuga. Atop Fuga’s head are Brook and Robin. Knowing that the CP0 are just behind the flames, they hop off and quickly put distance between them and the agents.
The CP0, still in pursuit, are stopped when their pictures are taken by Apoo who plans to sell the photos to Morgans of the World Economy News Paper. After Apoo reveals his plans, one of agents attacks him using his Shigan technique. The agent then turns his sights on to X Drake and attacks him using the same technique. He is, however, stopped by Apoo, who survived by defending himself using Armament Haki. Apoo uses Scratch Boom which sends the agent flying. X Drake suggests that they team up to take down the CP0 agents and Apoo gladly accepts.
Meanwhile, Onigashima is inching closer towards the Flower Capital. Momonosuke is still creating Flame Clouds to prevent the floating island from crashing. He remembers his promise to Luffy, Yamato, and the citizens of Wano, and the reason why he asked Shinobu to age him. He is determined not to betray this promise and keep everyone safe.
Inside, Komurasaki plays her shamisen while Orochi watches tearfully. The sound of the shamisen causes Enma to drain Zoro’s Haki. Seeing Zoro trying to stop Enma from fully draining him, King mocks how Zoro is having a falling out with his “friend.” The two continue their clash, with King continuously ridiculing and insulting Zoro.
Elsewhere, Sanji attacks Queen with Hell Memories, which sends the latter flying. However, the All-Star laughs it off, expressing his disappointment that he was not able to see Sanji use his Germa suit. Queen proceeds to provoke Sanji, calling him mentally weak for asking Zoro for help. He tells Sanji that Zoro isn’t any better and that he will not be able to defeat King since King is a Lunarian, a race people once revered as gods. Sanji brushes this off, asking how “gods” managed to become extinct.
Zoro is at a loss at how to defeat King. He attacks using his One Sword Style Iai: Death-Lion’s Song, an attack he deems to be stronger than his previous attacks. However, this does not cause any damage to King. Zoro hears the shamisen and once again, Enma drains his Haki. At the same time, King attacks Zoro with Tempuraudon and lands a hit on Zoro. This hit causes Zoro to let go of his swords. King notes that this is the first time he has ever seen a swordsman being held back by his own swords. Zoro falls and tries to retrieve his blades. He recalls the day he obtained Sandai Kitetsu, the cursed sword forged by Tenguyama Hitetsu. King attacks Zoro in midair which sends him crashing onto the side of the floating island. There, he finds Wado Ichimonji, the sword of Kuina, his childhood friend. In a flashback, Hitetsu explains that Enma and Wado Ichimonji were forged by the same person, the legendary swordsmith, Shimotsuki Kouzaburou. This is why Enma fits comfortably in Zoro’s hand. These memories make Zoro question how a sword from the Land of Wano ended up in a remote region in the East Blue.","Kazenbo, Yamato, Fuga, Brook, Nico Robin, Guernika, Maha, Scratchmen Apoo, X Drake, Kouzuki Momonosuke, Kouzuki Hiyori, Kurozumi Orochi, Roronoa Zoro, King, Queen, Sanji, Tashigi (flashback), Ipponmatsu (flashback), Tenguyama Hitetsu (flashback), Shimotsuki Kuina (image), Shimotsuki Koushirou (flashback)",
Episode 1060,The Secret of Enma! The Cursed Sword Entrusted to Zoro,"April 30, 2023","As Zoro recalls his past involving an old man he once knew, the clues from his memory help him realize the secret necessary to truly master Enma.","Zoro retrieves two of his swords and proceeds to attack King. The two engage in an intense exchange of blows. King launches his Barizodon attack. Zoro senses Enma nearby and immediately lunges to retrieve it. As Zoro grabs Enma, it immediately drains his Haki, emaciating his arm. King attacks him relentlessly and he barely manages to block the Lunarian’s slashes. Zoro falls and Enma continues to drain him.
Zoro recalls how he learned of the battle cry, “Sunacchi” and how Momonosuke was prohibited from uttering such cry. He explained to the young daimyo that he learned it from an old man from his village a long time ago. He remembers the old man who was always on the seacoast. He also recalls Hitetsu explaining that his two swords, Wado Ichimonji and Enma were both forged by the legendary swordsmith, Shimotsuki Kozuburo.
Zoro remembers events in a village in East Blue, thirteen years ago. A young Zoro was training with Kuina, his childhood friend, at the Isshin Dojo. Kuina easily disarmed him and knocked him down. Determined to best his rival, Zoro went to the coast to train. There he saw an old man looking towards the sea. Sensing that Zoro was a bit down, the old man taught him of the battle cry, “Sunacchi,” which, according to him, was a good-luck word to uplift one’s spirit. Zoro told him that he had no use for such a weird word, but asked the old man if he was a samurai, since everyone at the dojo said so. Instead of answering, the old man told Zoro to pay the gossip no mind. He then told the young boy that the Marines would be invading their village soon, but he refused to tell him why and told him to go home. Instead of going home, however, Zoro started training, while the old man watched on.
After Zoro explained why he was training hard, the old man offered to give Zoro two of his swords that he forged himself. He explained they were blunt so Zoro could use them for practice. The old man explained that swords were made to kill. Every sword had a personality and that it was a swordsman's job to tame them. He went on to say that a “cursed sword” is a fine sword and was simply called as such because the weak feared it. The old man recalled a sword that he forged when he was younger. He deemed it the greatest piece that he crafted in his life. Just by holding it, the blade would give the bearer chills, thus he dubbed it “the great king of hell.” Remembering all these, Zoro realizes that the aforementioned sword―the great king of hell―was none other than Enma.
Outside, Momonosuke accidentally grasps Kaidou's Flame Clouds. He realizes that since he is also a dragon, he can also control and manipulate the clouds. He proceeds to try and divert Onigashima’s path.
Meanwhile, Zoro pieces together the clues to the history of his village. It was not a coincidence that the village was named Shimotsuki. Hitetsu mentioned that Shimotsuki Kouzaburou, had left Wano more than fifty years ago. With all this information and his memories, Zoro deduces that the old man and Kouzaburou are one and the same. He remembers Kouzaburou explaining that it is the sword that chooses its wielder. With that, Zoro understood that Enma chose him and was simply testing him.
He recalls one night when he was younger and had challenged Kuina to their 2001st duel, all of which were won by the latter. Zoro cried in frustration, but Kuina told him that it is she who should be frustrated. Her father had told her that as a girl, she could never surpass a man as a swordsman. She envied Zoro for being a boy, since she, too, wanted to become the world’s greatest. Hearing Kuina utter those words angered Zoro since he was aiming to surpass her and saying that was insulting all the hard training he was doing. With this, the two made a pact to become the world’s greatest swordsman. The following day, Kuina died after falling down a flight of stairs. Distraught, Zoro begged Kuina’s father to give him Kuina’s sword, also promising to be so strong that his name reached her in heaven.
Back to the present, Zoro realizes that Enma was not draining him out of malice and admits that he was simply lacking thus unable to withstand the sword unlike Oden who had been using it with ease even though the sword took away so much of his Haki. Zoro tries to figure out how to control the flow of his Haki and keep it from being depleted and ultimately causing his death. Rather than fighting the sword's effects, he decides to let Enma take his Haki instead and “conquers” it, unleashing his Supreme King Haki and rendering the nearby Beast Pirates unconscious. King notices and asks if he was trying to be a king. Zoro answers by saying that he just remembered his promise to Luffy and Kuina.","Roronoa Zoro, King, Shimotsuki Kouzaburou (flashback), Kouzuki Momonosuke, Tenguyama Hitetsu (flashback), Shimotsuki Kuina (flashback), X Drake, Maha, Guernika, Scratchmen Apoo, Inbi, Zanki, Tashigi (flashback), Ipponmatsu (flashback), Kouzuki Hiyori (flashback), Shimotsuki Koushirou (flashback), Kouzuki Oden (fantasy), Monkey D.

Taking advantage of his scientific enhancements, Sanji discovers a new ability, Ifrit Jambe, which allows him to defeat Queen and send him falling off the island.","Sanji continues his battle against Queen. After Sanji destroys his Raid Suit, Queen decides to continue on with the battle. This time, he demonstrates his scientific enhancements and uses techniques from Sanji's brothers; he uses Ichiji's Sparking Red ability to fire laser eyes (Sparking Queen), Niji's Dengeki Blue to strike Sanji with electricity (Henry Queen), and Yonji's Winch Green ability to use his retractable arm as a winch, grabbing Sanji and spinning him in the air (Winch Queen). He reveals that he had a rivalry with Judge and his goal is to outperform Germa 66. Before he could slam Sanji into the ground, however, Sanji uses a Diable Jambe-infused kick to destroy Queen's mechanical arm.
In fury, Queen uses Sanji's Stealth Black ability to turn himself invisible to catch him off guard. However, Sanji uses Soru, allowing him to turn effectively invisible to Queen but physically taxing him. Queen plans to wait for him to exhaust himself, then strike him unexpectedly. Sanji perches on a wall looking for his next approach.
Some, the woman who Sanji accidentally attacked earlier, has her wounds bandaged and healed. However, the room where she and the other geishas were hiding are destroyed during the battle. The geishas decide to evacuate, but Some's pet mouse, Chuji, is missing, so Some stays behind to look for it.
Some follows Chuji dangerously into the battlefield, unaware of Queen's presence. Queen recognizes her; he had visited the pleasure hall numerous times in the past to request her services, but she repeatedly turned him down using sickness as an excuse. Seeing her healthy, Queen realizes that he had been lied to. Infuriated, he strikes Some in anger.
Seeing Queen attack a woman infuriates Sanji, allowing him to use a new ability. Using his strong exoskeleton to protect his body and coating his Diable Jambe flames with Armament Haki, he is able to turn the flames into hotter, blue flames, called Ifrit Jambe. This gives him added agility and greater kicking power against Queen. He strikes Queen in a set of attacks, knocking him into the ground.
Queen gets up, preparing his retaliation. Remembering his past and accepting the scientific advancements given to him by Germa 66, Sanji uses Bœuf Burst against Queen, sending a powerful flaming kick into Queen's stomach and defeating him. Queen's unconscious body is sent flying out of the Skull Dome and off Onigashima, falling into the mainland below. Emerging victorious from his battle, Sanji returns Chuji to Some then collapses from his injuries.","Vinsmoke Judge (flashback & fantasy), Sanji, Queen, Vinsmoke Ichiji (flashback & fantasy), Vinsmoke Niji (flashback & fantasy), Vinsmoke Reiju (flashback & fantasy), Vinsmoke Yonji (flashback & fantasy), Charlotte Oven (flashback), Some, Chuji, Charlotte Yuen (flashback), Zeff (flashback & fantasy), Franky (fantasy), Nico Robin (fantasy), Tony Tony Chopper (fantasy), Usopp (fantasy), Monkey D.

Episode 1062,The Three-Sword Style of the Supreme King! Zoro vs. King,"May 21, 2023","As the battle between Zoro and King reaches its climax, Zoro, after figuring out the secret of King's abilities, uses his newfound power to create the King of Hell Three Sword Style. As King remembers his past, the two fight it out with Zoro emerging as the victor.","King had asked Zoro if he was trying to be a king, but Zoro tells him that he was simply remembering his promise to his captain and his best friend. King scoffs at this, saying that so long as he and Kaidou were around, Zoro’s promise will never be fulfilled. With that, the two continue their battle, exchanging blow after blow. Zoro is exhausted, but King is still unscathed. King mocks his attempts and tells him that his sword attacks will not work against him.
King is now on the offensive. Zoro tries to analyze their battle while he is parrying King’s attacks. He knows that he is slashing King, but his slashes are not affecting him at all. Zoro uses his Ul-Tora Gari attack while infusing his swords with Supreme King Haki. The attack manages to make King bleed and also rips up the All-Star's mask. Zoro finally figures out that King’s durability and speed are directly linked to the flames on his back―that once the said flames go out, King’s speed increases, but his defense gets weaker.
A couple of Beasts Pirates see King without his mask and observe that he has black wings, white hair, and brown skin. They say that he is of a race so rare that the World Government awards 100,000,000 to those with information about their existence. King overhears this and burns them to death.
King and Zoro continue their battle outside the Skull Dome. King finally acknowledges Zoro’s strength and the danger he poses. Zoro accepts the compliment and vows to end Kaidou’s and the Beasts Pirates’ reign. King rebuffs this and declares that Kaidou will be the King of the Pirates. Zoro rejects this declaration and attacks with King of Hell, Three Sword Style: Rengoku Oni Giri.
King recalls the first time he met Kaidou on Punk Hazard many years ago. The younger Kaidou was a guinea pig of the World Government and had just escaped. While making his way out of the laboratory, he saw a young man engulfed by fire after undergoing a durability test. Kaidou surmised that he was a Lunarian, given his ability to withstand the raging fire. Kaidou told the young man that he was going to form a new pirate group and offered him a chance to make the not-so-fascinating world fascinating. The man accepted the offer after Kaidou guaranteed that he would change the world. After making their escape, Kaidou asked the man his name and he answered that it was ""Alber."" After noting how strong Alber was, Kaidou told him that he should be named ""King"" instead. Kaidou promised King that he would never betray him and made him his right-hand man.
Back in the present, Zoro’s attack is ineffective and King counters with Imperial Flaming Wings, which sends magma-like flames onto Zoro. King then strikes Zoro using his burning sword which Zoro blocks. Refusing to lose any of his swords, Zoro releases a burst of Haki which sends the two of them flying. Zoro is unable to see King, suspecting that the flames on King’s back are out since the Lunarian is moving at an incredible speed. Knowing that King is not invulnerable at this state, Zoro attacks using Yakkodori, knocking King back.
King realizes that Zoro has figured out the mechanics to his strength, and Zoro finally sees a window to King’s defeat. Zoro uses his Ul-Tora Gari technique, but King blocks the attack despite having his flames on. Zoro taunts King for blocking his attack, but King retorts that Zoro is biologically incapable of defeating him. He then launches his Imperial Flaming Wings attack which sends a multitude of magma-like streams onto Zoro. The flames try to engulf Zoro, but he cuts them down while he makes his way towards King. Zoro attacks with King of Hell, Three-Sword Serpent: 103 Mercies Dragon Damnation and King counters with his Extra Large Imperial Flaming Wings.
The clash sends a shockwave throughout Onigashima. King’s sword is broken, and his right wing is ripped apart. As King’s consciousness fades, he thinks of his captain. He had thought of Kaidou as the prophesized Joy Boy. Thankful for the life Kaidou gave to him, he asked his captain to remain the strongest. He also promised that he would never lose so that he can make Kaidou the King of the Pirates. At the same time, Zoro, too, recalls his vow to become the world’s greatest swordsman―a vow he made to Luffy, the man who he declared will become the Pirate King.","King, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Meanwhile after Drake is defeated, CP0 makes a report about the current situation on Onigashima, and how the only major forces left are Kaidou and Big Mom as the two continue their own individual battles.","King falls off Onigashima and Zoro loses consciousness after defeating the Lunarian. A Mary announces King's loss to a CP0 agent. The agent now assesses the situation to be dire as all of the Beast Pirates’ All-Stars and Tobiroppo members have lost. He notes that only Big Mom and Kaidou stand in the way of the Straw Hats’ victory.
Kaidou and Luffy’s battle is reaching its climax, however, if Luffy wins, Kaidou will lose control over his Flame Clouds which are keeping Onigashima afloat. The floating island will crash and the explosives in the basement will cause the Flower Capital to explode. Momonosuke, now able to control Kaidou’s Flame Clouds, tries to pull Onigashima away to safety.
Kazenbo, a flame specter, is continuing to make its way to the basement with the purpose of making Onigashima explode midair. Yamato, determined to prevent this from happening, finally reaches the door to the basement armory. With the help of Fuga, the doors are opened and Yamato rushes through.
Meanwhile, Usopp finds Kin’emon and Kiku who are both incapacitated. Beast Pirates come in droves to capture them and Usopp tries to fight back. The two samurai ask him to leave them behind, but Usopp chides them for their so-called honor and tells them to hold on to life instead, even with snot dripping from their faces. A few moments later, Izou arrives to stave off the pursuers while Usopp, Kin’emon and Kiku escape on Hamlet’s back.
On the third floor of the Skull Dome, Fukurokuju and Raizo are in a stand-off as the two cast Ninpo: Paralysis Jutsu at the same time. Neither one of them budge even though the whole floor is being engulfed in flames.
On the second floor, Komurasaki continues to play her shamisen as Orochi listens on, ecstatic that his love who he thought had died, is alive and well. In his bliss, he is hopeful that all his enemies will be wiped out and he and Komurasaki will get married and spend the rest of their days in Wano. He asks Komurasaki to play his favorite piece and Komurasaki indulges him.
Meanwhile, X Drake and Apoo are defeated by the CP0. Drake is knocked out and Apoo runs away. The agents are apprised of the defeat of the All-Stars and are ordered to leave Onigashima.
On the rooftop, Luffy and Kaidou deal their Supreme King Haki-coated attacks. Luffy lunges forward but Kaidou bats him away with his Hassaikai. Luffy uses his Gear 3 and attacks with his Roc Gun technique. Kaidou is knocked down and the impact of the attack also causes Luffy to fall to his back. Both are exhausted as they try to catch their breath while lying on the ground. The two stand back up with smiles on their faces. Luffy laughs as he tells Kaidou that it is starting to get fun and, with a huge grin on his face, Kaidou tells him that he feels the same way.","Roronoa Zoro, King, Joseph, Monkey D.

The Lawless Dragon Closing in on Luffy,"June 4, 2023","As Luffy continues to fight Kaidou, Kaidou uses a form of drunk fighting known as Shuron Hakke which makes the battle harder for Luffy. Meanwhile at Mary Geoise, as the Five Elders review the situation, they mention a Devil Fruit that had not awakened for centuries to which the World Government had to rename, just as Zunesha arrives at Wano Country.","While the battle between Kaidou and Luffy is taking place at the rooftop of the Skull Dome, Momonosuke is desperate to steer Onigashima away from the Flower Capital where its citizens are oblivious to the catastrophe that could befall them. In the Flower Capital, the people are drinking their fill and dancing to the music. They send lanterns to the sky, with their wishes written on them so that they may reach heaven. In hers, Toko writes that she wants to see her adoptive father again, which breaks Hitetsu’s heart.
Back at the rooftop, Kaidou looks at the beautiful night sky and takes out a barrel full of sake and takes huge gulps of the alcohol. Luffy is angry that he is drinking while they are fighting. Kaidou tells him that it is because he is having fun. Today is the Fire Festival and they had planned a banquet on Onigashima, but Luffy and the others messed it all up. He offers some booze to Luffy, but the latter refuses and declares, instead that he’ll have a banquet of his own after he beats Kaidou.
Kaidou releases a huge amount of Haki and tells Luffy that he hopes he can have a nice big banquet. Luffy is angered once more, seeing that Kaidou is now drunk. Indignant at the accusation, Kaidou throws the barrel of sake down and then weeps at his ruined banquet. He proceeds to hiccup and laugh while staggering around, barely able to keep standing upright. Incensed at the sight of a drunk Kaidou, Luffy charges at him. However, Kaidou easily evades him and attacks using his Lightning Hammered: Ragnaraku technique. Luffy receives a direct hit, and a shockwave is felt throughout the rooftop.
Now in his dragon form, a drunk, weeping Kaidou laments that even though he is having fun, the battle has already destroyed half of his castle which took five years to build. Kaidou continues to wail about his woes while attacking Luffy using his drunken techniques. Luffy continues to retaliate and finally lands a kick to his stomach which causes Kaidou to cough up blood.
Meanwhile, in Mary Geoise, the Five Elders complain how this year’s Levely is cursed. They mention that it resulted in the total abolition of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, an incident concerning the Arabasta Kingdom, and the Revolutionary Army’s infiltration of Mary Geoise. The blond elder says that they need to set those aside for now and immediately deal with what is happening in the Land of Wano. He is expectant that the CP0 have captured Nico Robin by now, and that the battles involving Big Mom and Kaidou will result to death. He mentions of the need to erase the existence of a certain Devil Fruit. Another elder rebuffs its existence, saying that the said fruit is a mere legend even to them as it has not awakened for centuries. However, the blond elder says that the World Government would not have bothered giving that Devil Fruit another name if they did not want to hide its name from history.
At the seas just outside of Wano, a fleet of Marine Ships are on standby awaiting orders. A scout sees a giant shadow and uses a Den Den Mushi to report this to his superior. He describes the shadow as an island. At a distance, a silhouette of a giant elephant trumpets as it arrives just behind the Marine fleet.","Monkey D.

On the third floor, Raizo and Fukurokuju are still at a standstill with neither one of them releasing their Paralysis Jutsu despite both being caught on fire. On the second floor, Jinbe helps some samurai escape by preventing them from being crushed by fallen debris and pointing out a route to their escape.
On the Performance Floor, Chopper returns to his normal form and is now able to move. He worries for Zoro whom he knows will be suffering twice as bad due to the special medicine which was administered to him in exchange for his temporary super healing. Outside, Zoro is slowly bleeding out. As his blood seeps into the ground, he wakes up in a desolate area. A dark apparition appears before him, resembling a grim reaper. With its scythe, it prepares to swing at Zoro who is frozen in place, calling out to the reaper to stop. Meanwhile, at the Right-Brain Tower, Franky searches for Zoro.
Elsewhere, Izou is finishing off the last of the Beasts Pirates who have been relentlessly attacking him. Weakened, he is easily stabbed in the stomach by a pirate who he shoots to death. He staggers away, using the wall to keep himself up. As he makes his way out of the castle, he hopes that Kin’emon and Kiku have escaped successfully. He comes across the CP0 agents who were after Robin. The agents tell him that they should pretend not to see each other as they had no intention of going after the last remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates since their business right now is with the Straw Hats. Instead of letting them go, however, Izou tells them to stop.
Yamato has finally reached the armory where the bombs are located. Kazenbo also reaches the armory preparing to set fire to the explosives therein. Yamato transforms and uses his Namuji Hyoga technique which freezes everything inside. He then swings at the flame specter, determined to stop it from fulfilling the command given to it by Kanjuro and Orochi. It proceeds to engulf Yamato in flames, with the latter screaming in pain.
Back at the Performance Floor, Big Mom continues to wreak havoc with her lightning attacks, knocking back Law and Kid. She remembers that Kaidou is on the rooftop fighting Luffy and wonders why she still has not heard the emperor’s shout of victory. She commands Hera to take her to the rooftop, but Law stops her with K-ROOM. He impales her with his sword and uses Shock Wille, causing her to fall.

At the Performance Floor, Big Mom wrestles with Kid’s Corna Dio and is knocked down but only for a moment. She stands up with her right arm visibly shattered. She tells them that Law’s shockwaves broke her ribs and acknowledges Law’s strength. She heals her arm using her Devil Fruit by giving her bones life and having them repair themselves. Seeing Big Mom unleash her Supreme King Haki, Law tells Kid that he will be out of energy in the next barrage. Before he can ask Kid to coordinate their attacks, Kid demands not to tell him what to do.
Big Mom calls to her homies, Napoleon, Prometheus, and Hera and launches her Maser Saber which cuts Kid’s metallic bull in half. Kid uses Assign on Big Mom, magnetizing her and the tower behind her. She is flung towards its wall, unable to escape. Kid’s metallic bull is launched towards her, so she tears the wall down and uses it to shield herself from Kid’s attack. She sarcastically thanks Kid for putting the wall on her back. Kid ignores this and proceeds to attack her legs, causing her to fall to her knees. Kid and Law bombard her with attacks and manage to damage her bit by bit. She is seemingly unable to keep up with the assault but finally shields herself and counters, sending the two Supernovas flying.

His sword finally reaches the earth’s magma pool and Law proceeds to launch Puncture Wille. Big Mom panics and cries out for him to stop. The technique creates a giant hole all the way to the ground. Law retracts his blade and moves away from Big Mom.
Big Mom almost falls into the hole but manages to grab on. She commands Misery to burn Law to death, but Law shouts to Kid to “do it.” Kid appears, ready to launch his attack. Big Mom eggs him on, saying that it will not be enough to take her down, but Law declares that her era has ended. Kid uses his Damned Punk technique and fires a beam at Big Mom, hoping to send the emperor through the hole Law created. However, she holds on, unwilling to go down.","Eustass Kid, Heat (fantasy), Wire (fantasy), Killer (fantasy), Monkey D. Luffy, Trafalgar D.

Meanwhile, Fukurokuju begins to lose his composure as a result of being set alight, and Zunesha starts to communicate with Kouzuki Momonosuke.","The standoff between Raizo and Fukurokuju continues as Raizo is ablaze and Fukurokuju's clothing begins to catch fire. Eventually, Fukurokuju is completely set alight. Unable to withstand the heat of the flames, he collapses and screams for water.
Meanwhile, Big Mom is cornered by Kid and Law, as Kid's Damned Punk attempts to knock her into the hole. As a last-ditch effort, she uses Soul Pocus and attempts to take fifty years from their lifespans, effectively killing them. However, as neither Kid nor Law feared her, the attack is rendered ineffective. Using his ability, Law creates an R-ROOM, a Room which attaches to her regardless of where she moves. As a homage to his mentor, Rosinante, he uses Silent, preventing Big Mom from making any sound as long as she remains inside the Room.
Misery attempts to aid Big Mom by attacking Law from behind, but Law uses his sword to slice her in half. Meanwhile, Kid uses a second Damned Punk, sending an even stronger ray which finally sends Big Mom falling into the hole.
Big Mom falls and lands in the armory. She grabs one of the frozen bombs, unaware that they were explosive. The bomb explodes, blasting a second hole in the bottom of the island causing her to fall towards the Wano Country mainland. Yamato is able to block the explosion with a frozen piece of debris, preventing the other bombs from detonating. However, the explosion considerably damaged Kazenbo, causing it to retreat towards Orochi.
The explosion causes the entire island to crumble. A wounded Zoro, who was resting on the edge of the island, falls off the island as a result of the island crumbling.
Big Mom is sent falling towards the ground. She notices the Fire Festival celebrations at the nearby Flower Capital, prompting her to reflect on her childhood with Carmel, her failure to defeat Luffy on Whole Cake Island, and finally her involvement in the raid. She curses Gol D. Roger for starting the Golden Age of Piracy, posthumously promoting the proliferation of new, inexperienced rookie pirates. Big Mom falls into the magma chamber, causing a large eruption of lava. Witnessing the fall of one of the Four Emperors, Kid and Law's crewmates cheer over the captains' accomplishment as the two rest from their epic fight with Big Mom. As Momonosuke continues to move Onigashima, he senses that Zunesha had appeared near the island. He deduces that Zunesha was one of the many companions of Joy Boy eight centuries ago.","Charlotte Linlin, Kouzuki Momonosuke, Eustass Kid, Misery, Compo, Boogie, Mosh, Quincy, House, Jean Bart, Clione, Trafalgar D.

Zunesha appears at Onigashima to aid the battle, but Momonosuke is unsure of whether to continue the battle. He explains to Yamato that it may not have been Oden's intention to liberate Wano Country if it endangered innocent lives.
Izou confronts the CP0 agents in the basement. The agents, Guernika and Maha, were willing to ignore him in pursuit of the Straw Hats, but Izou refused to let them pass. After a short battle, Izou was quickly overpowered by the agents, who both utilized Rokushiki to defeat him. However, as Maha fatally strikes Izou in the chest with a Shigan, Izou manages to shoot him down with his pistol, causing them to simultaneously take each other down.
Guernika briefly laments Maha's downfall. He then continues his search for Nico Robin, but he receives an imperial order from the Five Elders. As the World Government saw Luffy as an especially dangerous threat, they order Guernika to interrupt his battle with Kaidou and eliminate him immediately as a precaution. Guernika reluctantly obeys the order, but he is unaware he is being followed by Drake.
Komurasaki accompanies Orochi in his private chamber as he awaits Fukurokuju's return. Orochi becomes impatient and frustrated, but the ceiling suddenly collapses, crushing him under the rubble.

She plays Orochi's favourite song on her shamisen and reveals that the song was also the favourite of her father, Oden.
On the Skull Dome, Kaidou notices that Big Mom had been defeated by Kid and Law, and begins to mourn her, reflecting on how they met while serving Rocks' crew.

The remaining allied forces, despite being devastated by news of Luffy's alleged death, refuse to surrender, continuing the battle against the remaining Beasts Pirates.

However, Drake and Hawkins, both gravely injured during the raid, have a brief conversation before the latter succumbs to his injuries.

Sukiyaki shows Robin and Law to the Road Poneglyph at the bottom of the staircase, and reveals that Pluton is even further underground, but the only way to reveal it would be to open the country's borders by destroying the physical boundary walls.
In the outskirts of the Flower Capital, the Nine Red Scabbards continue their battle against Ryokugyu, but are overwhelmed by his ability.

Meanwhile, in the Flower Capital, the story of the return of the Kouzuki Family is recounted as a performance.","Wano Country starts to thrive after Orochi is deposed and Kaidou is defeated. The tale of the Raid on Onigashima is narrated on stage in front of an audience.
Elsewhere, Momonosuke, Kin'emon, and Yamato rush towards Tokage Port to catch up to the Straw Hat Pirates. On the way, Yamato tells Momonosuke that he will be staying in Wano instead of going with Luffy because he wants to do as Oden did and travel across Wano before setting out into the world.
Meanwhile, Momonosuke feels betrayed that Luffy would leave him behind before even saying farewell, despite all the adventures they went through together. Kin'emon also feels slighted by the Straw Hats' actions.
At the Tokage Port, Luffy parts ways with Law and Kid and they say their not-so-friendly farewells. The Kid Pirates and Heart Pirates sail towards their agreed destinations.
Before the Straw Hats can follow them, Momonosuke arrives at the beach, running. The young shogun expresses how hurt he is that the Straw Hats were leaving without saying their goodbyes. He bursts into tears, begging them not to go. Luffy hands him a Straw Hat Jolly Roger as a sign of their friendship and to remind him of their time together. He tells Momonosuke that he will always think of him as his brother. He adds that if Momonosuke, Kin'emon, and Yamato ever decided to become pirates, he'll come back and pick them up anytime.
The Straw Hats finally set sail and head to Hakumai, Wano's official port that has a lift to lower ships, which is a much safer alternative than going through the waterfalls they previously went through when they arrived at Wano. Kid makes fun of Luffy and Law for using the official port―a much safer option, which is uncharacteristic of a pirate. Law and Luffy are irked by Kid's remarks and take the provocation as a challenge and head towards the waterfalls instead.
Meanwhile, the tale of the Raid on Onigashima continues and the audience listened on how Wano was saved from its darkest hour. The citizens of Wano learned of Big Mom's role in the great battle and as a result has become a legend in the country called ""O-Lin the Great Yōkai"" and Kaidou is now known as the ""Dragon King"". As everyone listened in awe of how the ""three mighty outlaws"" recruited by Shogun Momonosuke emerged victorious from the menacing forces, the narrator of the epic tale told Hiyori's final words to the former shogun as he burned to death: ""Black charcoal would not be called Kurozumi if it wasn't burned!""

Episode 1086,A New Emperor! Buggy the Star Clown!,"December 3, 2023","As the Straw Hats leave Wano, they find out their new bounties. Meanwhile, on Karai Bari Island, Mihawk and Crocodile confront Buggy for being portrayed as the clown's subordinates. However, they relent after they realize that it is not the worst idea to have Buggy bear the brunt of the Marines' attention and have him become one of the new Emperors of the Sea. Thus, the Cross Guild is established with Buggy as the figurehead, and Mihawk and Crocodile as its Chief Officers.","As the Straw Hats leave Wano, Nami is enraged with Luffy who decided to descend Wano through the waterfalls instead of the official port. A little while later, Robin buys a newspaper from a News Coo and remarks that their new bounties have been released.
With Luffy now being one of the new Four Emperors, he is referred to as the Senior Captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet and his crewmen its Senior Officers. Their bounties have all increased as follows:
Meanwhile, Crocodile and Mihawk arrive on Karai Bari Island, Buggy's Delivery's hideout. Buggy begs for his life for the misunderstanding which portrayed Crocodile and Mihawk as his subordinates, causing the World Government to declare him one of the Four Emperors. This is despite the fact that Crocodile and Mihawk were the ones who established Cross Guild. According to them, the word ""humiliation"" is not enough to describe the situation, so they must kill the clown.
In a flashback, it is shown how Mihawk and Crocodile agreed to team up following the dissolution of the Warlord system during the recent Levely. The dissolution stripped Mihawk of his immunity and reverted him to his status as a pirate and fugitive of the law. They arrived on Karai Bari Island which was surrounded by a fleet of Marines that was bombarding Buggy's Delivery hideout with artillery fire. Mihawk and Crocodile sink the Marine ships and get rid of the Marine forces. This act caused Buggy's underlings to mistakenly think that Crocodile and Mihawk were there as Buggy's henchmen saving their supposed boss. In truth, they were there to collect a debt Buggy owed Crocodile because they needed money to fund their newly-established company. Buggy was unable to pay, so he instead offered up his services to work off his debt. He offered manpower, advertising, and transportation services to the two, which they accepted.
Back in the present, Crocodile shows Buggy the flyers the latter distributed for Cross Guild which showed him at the center of the poster, his picture larger than that of Crocodile's and Mihawk's, implying that he was their boss. This was caused by Buggy's passionate underlings who revered him as their great and powerful leader. The poster reached the Marines who saw Buggy as a threat, being that he was once a part of Roger's crew, much like Shanks. The Marines also thought that Mihawk and Crocodile came to his aid that day. With the increasing influence Cross Guild built around the world, they put out new bounties for the three. Crocodile's bounty was increased to 1,965,000,000, Mihawk's bounty was increased to 3,590,000,000, and Buggy's bounty was increased to 3,189,000,000 as their supposed leader and new Emperor of the Sea.
After a while, Mihawk relents and thinks that it is not a bad idea to have Buggy as their figurehead. He has no plans of becoming an Emperor himself as he would rather live a peaceful life. Crocodile finally agrees after seeing the merits. Buggy then addresses everyone in the hideout as the new figurehead of the Cross Guild. He introduces Mihawk and Crocodile as the guild's new Chief Officers.","Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 1087,The War on the Island of Women! A Case Involving Koby the Hero,"December 10, 2023","The Marines invade Amazon Lily to arrest Boa Hancock with the aid of their new Seraphim Pacifista. However, the Blackbeard Pirates also invade Amazon Lily, where Blackbeard captures Hancock, with the intention of stealing her Devil Fruit power.","Marco is dropped off near Sphinx Island by the Red Hair Pirates. He thanks Shanks for letting him hitch a ride before he flies towards the island.
In a flashback on Wano Country, Marco saw Yamato tell Luffy and the others his reason why he would not be joining the Straw Hats just yet because he wanted to stay and protect Wano. After the incident with Aramaki, Yamato was certain that more powerful people would be targeting Wano, especially now that Kaidou no longer ruled over the land. Luffy accepted his reasons and told Yamato that if he stayed, he would not have to worry about Momonosuke and the others. With that, Marco flew over the group to tell them that he was going to hitch a ride out of Wano. They said their farewells after Luffy thanked him for saving his life back during the Summit War of Marineford.
Back to the present on Amazon Lily, Gloriosa laments at how the island was invaded by men with part of its mountain cut down and its town heavily damaged. A bandaged Boa Hancock tells her that so long as she stays on the island, the Marines will come back, especially with the Warlord system abolished.
A few weeks ago, the island was under attack by a fleet of Marines that rained artillery fire onto the island's gates. They were met with haki-coated arrows by the Kujas. After this counterattack, Koby ordered the deployment of the new Pacifistas, the Seraphim, to the battlefront. Two of these winged Pacifistas with fire on their backs appear. The Marines docked on the island and Sweet Pea ran towards them to stop them from advancing. However, she was slapped away by one of the Seraphims. The Kujas were shocked that what seemed like a child could possess such strength and upon taking a closer look, the said child looked so much like a younger Hancock.
A while later, the Blackbeard Pirates also arrived on the island, with Blackbeard sending a Seaquake towards the Marines' ships. Blackbeard, together with Vasco Shot and Catarina Devon, walked towards town with the intention of obtaining Hancock's Devil Fruit. The Marines attacked them on their way to town, but Blackbeard easily neutralized them using his Blackhole powers. They encountered the second Seraphim who resembled a younger Mihawk. Blackbeard noticed the Seraphim's white hair, brown skin, and black wings and drew a conclusion about what it was.
The Seraphim lunged at Blackbeard with his sword, but Blackbeard dodged the attack. The Seraphim once again attacked Blackbeard who blocked it with Armament Haki but the attack still sent the Emperor flying. This move sliced off a large portion of the island's central mountain. However, despite the magnitude of the attack, Blackbeard remained unscathed, although very annoyed and somewhat flustered to find out that the Seraphim was a Pacifista. The Seraphim tried slashing him again while some Marines arrived at the scene. Seeing this, Blackbeard used Blackhole which caused the Seraphim to jump away to avoid being sucked into the void like the nearby buildings and the Marines.
Meanwhile at the palace, Hancock, who had previously refused to heed Koby's demands to surrender, walked out to the balcony. She flipped her hair and showed off with her beauty which made the hearts of the Marines and the Blackbeard Pirates flutter. This allowed her to use Slave Arrow and turn most of them into stone. The Pacifistas tried to attack Hancock, but their attacks destroyed those who were petrified so Koby, who was unaffected by Hancock's powers, ordered them to stop. Hancock spotted Koby in the crowd and tried to kick him. However, before she could land her attack, she was caught midair by Blackbeard who used Black Vortex.
Hancock, whose powers were nullified by Blackbeard's darkness, demanded that he unhand her. Blackbeard commended her for turning his subordinates into stone, saying that she wasn't the Pirate Empress for nothing. Blackbeard expressed his desire to obtain her Devil Fruit, but she told him that her powers were nothing without her beauty. She added that if he killed her, his people would remain petrified, and the next user would be unable to undo the petrification.","Lucky Roux, Yasopp, Limejuice, Benn Beckman, Marco, Shanks, Bonk Punch, Monster, Monkey D.

After being subdued by Blackbeard, Hancock attempted to form a peace deal with him, agreeing to reverse the petrification done on his pirates if they retreated. However, Blackbeard doggedly refuses, attempting to kill her under the belief that Boa Hancock was going to petrify everyone the moment she was no longer under the effect of the Yami Yami no Mi.
However, Rayleigh appears on the island and intervenes, intimidating Blackbeard into submission with Supreme King Haki. Rayleigh oversees the deal, forcing both the Marines and Blackbeard Pirates to leave. However, it is revealed that Koby was kidnapped by Blackbeard shortly after their departure. In the present day, the Kuja Pirates fear the Marines' Seraphims, who left the conflict without taking any damage. They also note that one of the Seraphim bears a striking resemblance to Hancock in her childhood.
In the Kamabakka Kingdom, members of the Revolutionary Army worry about Sabo's safety after being blamed by newspapers for the assassination of King Nefertari Cobra and Vivi's kidnapping. However, they receive a call on a Den Den Mushi from Sabo, confirming that he is alive. Meanwhile, on the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hat Pirates mourn Cobra's death and express concern for Vivi's safety, but they doubt Sabo's involvement given that the Revolutionary Army has never targeted a monarch. Although most members intend to rescue Vivi, Zoro opposes the idea, stating that it is still too early to act, and Vivi must fend for herself at the moment.
Resting on the ship deck, Luffy reflects on the brotherhood oath he made with Ace and Sabo. He then reveals to his crew his members the end of his dream, an ambition even larger than becoming the Pirate King. Though it is not revealed, each of the Straw Hats react with bafflement, with Usopp believing Luffy's dream to be impossible while Franky and Chopper were amazed and supported the idea.","S-Snake (fantasy and flashback), Boa Hancock, Boa Sandersonia, Boa Marigold, Gloriosa, Shakuyaku, Silvers Rayleigh, Marshall D.

The Five Elders at Mary Geoise learn of Sabo's location at Lulusia, a kingdom in upheaval during the Levely. Sabo contacts the Revolutionary Army, reassuring them he did not assassinate King Cobra, contrary to the news reports circulating. When he is about to tell them what he actually witnessed that day at the Empty Throne inside the Pangaea Castle, one of the Five Elders orders the Marines' Communication Department to cut off communications and to forget that they ever traced or heard Sabo's call.
Elsewhere, Imu crosses off Lulusia on a map. The sky over Lulusia darkens and starts glowing with an eerie green light. Suddenly, rays of red light come raining down on the island, destroying everything and everyone they hit. Sabo's call to the Revolutionary Army is abruptly cut off. In a matter of seconds, the island is obliterated, resulting in a huge seaquake originating from where the island used to be.
A few days later, the Straw Hats enter the climate range of a harsh winter island nearby, encountering a massive Warm Eddy. Luffy spots someone inside the water column so Zoro cuts the water in half to rescue her. Chopper emerges from inside the cabins to investigate the commotion outside, but he is swept away by the strong wind. Luffy, swept away by the wind along with Chopper, manages to rescue both the reindeer and the girl, grabbing hold of her while airborne. The girl starts screaming to those on the ship to warn them of what's lurking below the waters. Usopp senses two glowing eyes and tells everyone to run. The two glowing eyes belong to a giant shark, threatening to devour their ship.","Jinbe, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Helmeppo and Hibari request Prince Grus for help in rescuing Koby from Hachinosu.","Luffy, Chopper and the young girl are struggling with wind, while the shark tries to eat the Sunny by spreading its jaws. But, with Jinbe in the helm, they overcame the danger. The shark was revealed to be made of iron and too big for an ordinary shark. Jinbe notices the three to fall in the sea and orders Franky to take the helm. He uses ""Rabbit Screw"" to overcome the speed of the shark, and save the others from water.
Jinbe struggles against the strong water currents but holds the three after sometime. On the other side, the shark attacks the Sunny by using torpedoes and rolled the ship. The rest of the crew boarded on the ship started sinking with the ship.
When Jinbe and the others resurfaced on water, the shark tries to attack them, but failed as Jinbe told them to take deep breath as they would escape to the sea bottom. On the other side, the rest of the Straw Hats were saved by a giant robot who attacked the shark.
The scene shifts to the G-14 branch of Marines where Tashigi is saying the children to drink the medicine prepared for them to reverse their mutated growth. Mocha thanks Tashigi saying that she feels a lot smaller, a little more left to return to normal. She wishes to return home and meet the Straw Hats later.
Tashigi was called by Doll concerning Helmeppo's request to save Koby. When Helmeppo and Hibari requests Prince Grus for help to rescue Koby from the pirates' captive from Hachinosu, he suggests to take the Seraphims from Egghead since the island was close. Grus reminded them of the dangers they have to face taking the risk to save Koby then.
Meanwhile, Luffy, Chopper, Jinbe and the girl (who is not a child any longer, but an adult) were on the shore of an island, where the girl revealed herself to be Jewelry Bonney. She asks Luffy about his form and hair on his latest wanted poster, which he replied goofily. Seeing that, she thinks again if he really is an emperor any why Jinbe is with them. When they felt hungry, Luffy suggested to look for a restaurant which was turned down by Bonney saying there is not any, since it was a Government island and its name is Egghead. It is the place where Vegapunk lives. Luffy realizes he heard the name before and Bonney tells them, she has a business with Vegapunk.
Above the surface, a girl came out of the robot. She was thanked by Franky for saving them, while she revealed the Mecha-shark had some programming problems and she had no intentions of saving the pirates.

Elsewhere, the Heart Pirates are attacked by the Blackbeard Pirates.","Somewhere in the New World, CP0 agents discuss about Dr. Vegapunk's brilliance and how he split himself into six satellite bodies. It is revealed that their missions are to return a Seraphim resembling Bartholomew Kuma back to Egghead, and to eliminate Dr. Vegapunk and his satellites. Lucci ponders a potential connection between their mission and Lulusia's fate, but Kaku and Stussy hesitate to delve deeper on the subject as they might face similar repercussions.
On Egghead, Luffy's group parts ways with Atlas, one of Vegapunk's satellites. They notice the island's inhabitants wearing distinct clothing and discover the machine responsible, using it to change their attire. Bonney bids Luffy's group farewell, intending to look for Vegapunk. Just as she is about to leave, Luffy senses the presence of who he thinks is Kuma nearby. This Kuma, wearing a police uniform, starts scanning for intruders. Seeing this, Luffy instructs everybody to run away, much to Bonney's confusion. Kuma aims his laser towards the fugitives, which they barely dodge. Bonney freezes at the sight of the assailant while Luffy charges at him. After a short while, Bonney comes to her senses and starts running towards Luffy, kicking him in the head. She demands for him to stop and tearfully reveals that Kuma is her father.
Kuma is relentless in his pursuit and shoots his laser at Bonney, but she does not make any attempts to move away. Luffy runs to save her, explaining that the Kuma before her is actually a Pacifista.

As a result, both the Heart Pirates and Blackbeard Pirates engage in a full-scale battle.","Following an assault from the Blackbeard Pirates, the Heart Pirates' Polar Tang plunges into the sea in an attempt to flee. However, Blackbeard persistently targets their ship, pushing it to the brink. Recognizing the dire situation, Law decides to make for the nearest island.
While Law continues to issue orders to his crew, they are shocked to see that he has transformed into a woman. Moments later, the other crew members also undergo this transformation, which Law attributes to an infectious disease. However, drawing from his experiences battling the Emperors of the Sea, he manages to overcome the disease and nullify the effects of the Devil Fruit causing it by surging an overabundance of Haki.
As the Heart Pirates dock on the island, Doc Q commends Law for curing the Feminization Disease that had afflicted the entire crew using his newly acquired Shiku Shiku no Mi. Van Augur and Burgess, who have also recently acquired the Wapu Wapu no Mi and the Riki Riki no Mi, respectively, warp to the island. Burgess lifts an entire mountain and hurls it toward the Heart Pirates. Law deduces that the reason why the Blackbeard Pirates' bounties keep going up is because they obtained their new Devil Fruits by hunting down other power-users. Using ROOM and Amputate, Law slices the mountain into pieces.
From a distance, Blackbeard observes the conflict, reveling in the confrontation. Anticipating Law, Luffy, or Kid's arrival after departing Wano Country, Blackbeard greets Law and reveals his aim to seize their Road Poneglyphs. Law smirks and accepts Blackbeard's challenge, declaring that the winner takes all.
Law orders his crew to head to sea while he confronts Blackbeard. He uses R-ROOM, covering a large area, and then uses Amputate on Stronger, slicing his body in two, causing Blackbeard and Doc Q to fall from his back. As they fall, Blackbeard employs Gurash, destroying the ground beneath the Heart Pirates. Meanwhile, Doc Q hurls his basket of exploding apples toward the Heart Pirates, but Shachi swiftly gathers and expels a large amount of water from his mouth, intercepting the apples mid-air. Subsequently, Shachi and Penguin dive into the sea to target their enemy's ship.
On the island, Van Augur prepares to shoot Law, but Bepo senses the danger and directs Jean Bart to shield their captain. Van Augur fires, but Jean Bart absorbs the impact, the bullet failing to penetrate his flesh. Law employs K-ROOM, impaling Blackbeard with his sword, and follows up with Shock Wille, dealing significant damage. Van Augur clicks his tongue disapprovingly, remarking that their situation is a result of charging in without a concrete plan. He then warps near Blackbeard, who is still descending, and offers to return to their ship. However, Blackbeard chuckles and expresses his desire to continue the confrontation. With this, Van Augur teleports Blackbeard in front of Law. Law mocks Blackbeard for having his top officers become power-users and highlights their vulnerability to the sea. Blackbeard dismisses the weakness, arguing that their advantages outweigh any such vulnerabilities.
Inside the Blackbeard Pirates' ship, the crew remains composed, confident in their captain's strength despite the relentless assault by the Heart Pirates. Meanwhile, in a holding cell, Pudding is revealed to be a prisoner, abducted by Kuzan and Van Augur from Whole Cake Island. At the same time at the Marine Headquarters, news of Law and Blackbeard's clash reaches the Marines, prompting Sakazuki to reluctantly order his men to stand down and await the outcome of their battle.

While Zoro and Brook remain behind to guard the Thousand Sunny, Sanji's group encounters a Jinbe look-a-like.","Bonney, Luffy, Chopper, and Jinbe continue to run from the Pacifista; cornered, they have no choice but to begin fighting back. However, Bonney uses her Devil Fruit powers to transform herself and Jinbe into children and Luffy and Chopper into elderly people. Changing their appearance makes the Pacifista fail to recognize them, and it walks away.
Jinbe explains what he has been told about Kuma; being a tyrannical king of the Sorbet Kingdom, he was soon deposed by his own people and became a pirate and officer of the Revolutionary Army. He was eventually arrested by the Marines and sentenced to life in prison, but was offered freedom as one of the Seven Warlords, and in exchange was subjected to experimental human augmentation and turned into a cyborg by Vegapunk. Upon being told this, Bonney doggedly denies that Kuma willingly submitted to the World Government, insisting that he was turned into a cyborg against his will.
Meanwhile, Lilith brings the remaining Straw Hat Pirates to the above-cloud portion of Egghead, the Labophase. While Zoro, Brook and Caribou remain in the docked Thousand Sunny, Nami, Usopp, Robin, Franky and Sanji follow Lilith to an outfitter where they change their clothes, then they enter the lab. Amazed by the escalator as well as the doors they can walk through, they are directed by another satellite, Edison, through the laboratory.

The Seraphim, named S-Shark, is capable of Fish-Man Karate, firing lasers from his hand like a Pacifista, and also possesses the abilities of the Sui Sui no Mi. Sanji, Robin, and Usopp each unleash their attacks against S-Shark, each failing to inflict any damage to it. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Lilith is manipulating S-Shark in the control room along with two other satellites, Edison (representing thinking) and Pythagoras (representing wisdom).
In the control room, Edison controls S-Shark during an experiment to help it evolve and grow. He decides to stop controlling S-Shark to write down his new ideas for inventions, leaving the task to Pythagoras. However, they, along with Atlas, express hunger, so they rely on York, the satellite representing greed, to eat on their behalf. York eats a copious amount of food, defecates in a nearby bathroom, and goes back to sleep. His hunger satiated, Pythagoras controls the Straw Hats' shoes, moving them in the path of S-Shark's laser and holding them in place.
Against the wishes of Lilith, Edison and Pythagoras, Shaka decides to intervene in the battle. Deciding he had gathered enough data, he enters the battlefield and orders S-Shark to retreat. Now safe, the Straw Hats speak with Shaka, who introduces himself as another Vegapunk. Shaka reveals that, while dubbed the ""island of the future,"" Egghead is really from the past, as there existed an analogous island nine centuries prior.

Episode 1096,A Forbidden Piece of History! A Theory Concerning a Kingdom,"March 3, 2024","Shaka reveals the existence of an ancient kingdom, whose existence has been erased from history by the World Government. This erasure was the reason behind the Ohara Incident, but he reveals to Robin that the books from the island's library survived the fire. Meanwhile in the scrapyard, as they are checking out the giant robot, Luffy's group meets Dr. Vegapunk.","Shaka speaks with Sanji's group about his theory surrounding the advanced ancient kingdom, based on the archaeological findings near the island. Shaka's theory suggests that the kingdom was one of the central figures of the Void Century, having been destroyed by the twenty kingdoms that later formed the World Government. To erase all traces of the kingdom and its ideas from history, the World Government outlawed all study of the time period, creating a century-long gap in recorded history.
Shaka connects this event to the Ohara Incident, suggesting that the Buster Call was ordered on Ohara because the scholars attempted to study the Void Century. Knowing Clover, Shaka visited the destroyed island to pay tributes, but discovered books discarded in a lake. This suggests that the scholars sacrificed their lives to throw the books out of the burning Tree of Knowledge, saving the writings from being destroyed. In addition, Olvia insisted that Robin escape Ohara alive so their knowledge would not be lost.
Seeing the dedication of the Ohara scholars to preserve the writings of the past, Robin begins to cry. Concluding his story, Shaka states that he had the books excavated out of the lake, but encountered an unknown person.
Meanwhile, Luffy and Chopper examine the robot in the Fabiriophase junkyard, and attempt to locate its cockpit to ride it, after which they try in vain to activate it. Though they fail to activate it, they are knocked back by an explosion-like force. They discover that an unknown old man has attempted to warp to the location, having warped halfway inside the robot where he is now stuck. After Luffy pulls the man out, Bonney recognizes him as the original Dr. Vegapunk, leading scientist of the SSG.

He also confirms to Robin the identity of their leader. At the scrapyard, Bonney attempts to kill Vegapunk. Meanwhile, a masked assassin approaches Egghead.","Shaka continues explaining his visit to Ohara. When Vegapunk visited the island to pay respects, he discovered giants fishing the books out of the lake. Though Vegapunk was initially concerned with the giants’ intentions, Monkey D. Dragon appeared and explained that the giants intended to transport the books to Elbaf to withhold them from the World Government. Vegapunk then travelled to Elbaf to read the books, gaining knowledge from the scholars that the World Government attempted to suppress. The Ohara Incident also led Dragon, a friend of Clover, to later form the Revolutionary Army, joining forces with Emporio Ivankov and Bartholomew Kuma. Finishing his story, Shaka confirms to Robin that the leader of the giants was Saul, the same person who saved Robin from the Buster Call. Shaka then leads the Straw Hats to the security room.
Meanwhile, Luffy’s group questions Vegapunk, who is known for his balloon-like head but currently wears only an apple-shaped cap in its place. Vegapunk explains he ate the Nomi Nomi no Mi, making him a “Brain Human” and allowing him to absorb nigh-infinite amounts of knowledge. However, as he learned more, his brain grew as a result, becoming inefficiently large. So, he detached his brain and replaced it with an antenna. The still-expanding brain, dubbed the “Punk Records,” is the giant egg floating above the island, and remotely connects to Vegapunk’s body via the antenna. Furthermore, Vegapunk split his personality into six different satellites (Shaka, Lilith, Edison, Pythagoras, Atlas and York), which use the same brain but serve different purposes.
Bonney suddenly attacks Vegapunk, wielding a beam saber and demanding justice for her father. However, the beam’s light attracts a swarm of insects, which causes Bonney to faint in shock as Shaka’s group watches via surveillance footage. Vegapunk deems the saber a failed invention for its tendency to attract such insects.
Vegapunk explains that Momonosuke’s Devil Fruit was also a failed experiment. He created an artificial Devil Fruit intended to replicate Kaidou’s Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu, which was later accidentally eaten by Momonosuke. Despite granting all the abilities the original fruit provided, the fruit was deemed a failure based on colour alone, as the eater became a pink dragon instead of an azure one.
Luffy questions Vegapunk about the robot, but Vegapunk explains that the legendary Iron Giant is not one of his inventions. Instead, it was created two hundred years prior and attacked Mary Geoise.

According to legend, the robot climbed the Red Line and attacked Mary Geoise, but ran out of power and stopped working before it could inflict any damage. The inactive robot has since been kept in the scrapyard, though the World Government is unaware it is there and seeks to destroy it. Shaka, who listens to their conversation, adds that he based the Vegaforce-01 on the Iron Giant, but could not replicate its power source, which remains unknown.
In the distance, a World Government ship carrying CP0 agents approaches Egghead. The ship's commander, assassin Rob Lucci, demands entry into the ports, and when denied, he orders his subordinates to fire their cannons at the Sea Beast Weapons guarding the ship. In response, Shaka prepares to repel the assassins and deny their entry into Egghead. Lucci and Kaku attempt to persuade Pythagoras into allowing them into Egghead, but after repeatedly being denied by Pythagoras, they resort to violence and attempt to enter by force.
Vegapunk then laments Bonney's situation, but asks Luffy to take him away from Egghead. He also expresses his ambition to make energy infinite and free worldwide, stopping international wars over finite energy resources. He discovers that the key to infinite energy is the ancient energy that powered the Iron Giant.

Fearing the defeat of CP0, Sakazuki states he has sent Kizaru to the island to support the CP0 agents. He orders the CP0 agents not to battle Luffy until the Marines' arrival.
On Egghead, against Kaku and Stussy's advice, Lucci disobeys his order and battles Luffy. After combat in their base forms ends in a standstill, Luffy transforms into his Gear 5 form, using his awakened form. Lucci responds by transforming into his awakened form, revealing he had gotten stronger since their battle at Enies Lobby. This new form allows him to run at higher speeds, overwhelming Luffy and allowing him to attack by surprise.

Luffy and Lucci continue to battle in their awakened forms, causing mass destruction to the Fabiriophase and sending the civilians to evacuate.
Vegapunk watches Luffy in awe via surveillance footage with Nami's group. He explains that the Gomu Gomu no Mi is not registered in the Devil Fruit encyclopedia, but it allows its user to become the legendary sun god Nika. Vegapunk then explains his theory surrounding Devil Fruits; according to him, when one person desires to have a particular power, the power manifests in a Devil Fruit, though in exchange the eater becomes an enemy of the sea.
Sentomaru arrives in Egghead, ordered to side with the Straw Hats and battle the CP0 agents. Though initially reluctant to side with pirates, he agrees, ordering the Seraphim to attack the enemy forces.

Episode 1115,"The Marines Surprised! Marine Headquarters' Former Admiral, Kuzan","August 11, 2024","In the past, after having some drinks with the Blackbeard Pirates, Kuzan is convinced by Blackbeard to join them. In the present, Kuzan faces his former mentor Garp in battle. Meanwhile, at Winner Island, Blackbeard has defeated Law. This forces Bepo to use a special drug to briefly enter Sulong form to save his captain and then he escapes with Law to the sea.","Blackbeard confronted Kuzan for attacking his territory, but they quickly resolved their conflict, having drinks together. Together, Kuzan explained his defeat against Sakazuki, including how he lost his leg from the battle. Kuzan and Blackbeard also discussed the state of the Road Poneglyphs, including the mysterious pirate Hinokizu rumoured to possess one of the Road Poneglyphs.
However, when Laffitte suggested killing Kuzan to poach his Devil Fruit abilities, Kuzan overheard and entered a fit of rage, freezing many of the people in the bar. To defuse the situation, Blackbeard offered Kuzan a position in the Blackbeard Pirates. Though Kuzan was initially reluctant to join the crew, he decided to accept the offer because while he did not want to befriend Blackbeard, they shared a mutual goal of upturning the Marines' idea of justice.
In the present day, Kuzan concludes his explanation, and Garp demands Kuzan cut ties with Blackbeard and return to the Marines. They quickly enter battle, and though Kuzan initially freezes Garp in a ball of ice with his Devil Fruit powers, Garp frees himself and knocks Kuzan down with Blue Hole.
Meanwhile, on Winner Island, Blackbeard prepares to kill Law, having defeated the rest of the Heart Pirates and sunk the Polar Tang. Bepo, who is also critically wounded, attempts a last-resort attack, using a drug Chopper gave him to transform into his Sulong form. Transformed, he defeats both Blackbeard and Van Augur, and though he loses his Sulong form almost immediately after, he rescues Law and swims away carrying him, as Burgess throws boulders at them.","Marshall D.

Meanwhile at Momoiro Island, Sabo returns with refugees from Lulusia Kingdom. He decides to have a private meeting with Dragon and Ivankov to tell them what really happened at the Levely.","Tsuru and Sengoku meet each other, where they learn of Vice Admiral T Bone's murder in Pepe Kingdom. They lament that T Bone was killed by one of the civilians he was trying to protect, as the killer, a poor citizen, killed him for his Cross Guild bounty just to support his family. At the big top, Buggy congratulates the killer for his deed and offers him a role in the Cross Guild.
Buggy then hears that his shipwrights have built a flagship for the Cross Guild, but he finds to his horror that his overzealous followers have placed Buggy's face as the ship's figurehead. Humiliated by the ship's design, Mihawk and Crocodile drag Buggy to the meeting room, where they torture him for his leadership.
Mihawk and Crocodile explain that they intend for the Cross Guild to be a business, committing crimes for wealth and power. However, Buggy interrupts them, explaining his desires to find the One Piece and become the Pirate King. Mihawk and Crocodile, unwilling to face the other Emperors, continue to beat him. However, Buggy announces his desires via Den Den Mushi to his underlings, who all support him and are motivated to achieve this goal.
On Momoiro Island, the deputy commanders of the Revolutionary Army watch the coast, where they see Sabo return after not having replied to any of the other members' calls.

Episode 1117,Sabo Returns - The Shocking Truth to Be Told!,"September 1, 2024","After Sabo makes his report about his mission to Mary Geoise, he begins his story to Dragon and Ivankov about what happened. As the flashback begins, the Revolutionary Army began their attack, freeing the slaves and dealing with the opposition from the World Government forces. Meanwhile, Charlos plans a second attempt to capture Princess Shirahoshi and King Cobra prepares for his meeting with the Five Elders.","While meeting with Dragon and Ivankov, Sabo celebrates their partial success at the Levely, stating that they have succeeded in prompting a revolution in eight different nations. Each of these nations have stopped paying their Heavenly Tributes, and the Revolutionary Army has additionally attacked World Government suppliers to lay siege on Mary Geoise. However, they lament the assassination of Cobra, whom they deemed a benevolent and competent king. First mention of the God's Knights is made by Dragon.
Sabo explains the events of the Levely. As Revolutionary Army attacked Mary Geoise, Karasu, Lindbergh, and Morley free the World Nobles' slaves, instructing them to meet at the east side of town to be evacuated out of the town. However, Karasu entered battle with Fujitora, and Ryokugyu similarly confronted Morley. While Fujitora and Ryokugyu each attempted to unleash attacks against them, they had to do so without harming the World Nobles. Jabra, Kalifa, Blueno, Kumadori, and Fukurou watched the chaos.
As the battle occurs outside, Sabo snuck inside Pangea Castle in search of the keys to the slaves' collars. However, he learned that Charlos is attempting again to enslave Shirahoshi, this time using Kuma to do his bidding. Enraged by this, Sabo immediately changed his objectives, setting out to rescue Kuma.
Meanwhile, Cobra prepared to meet the Five Elders. His bodyguards, Pell and Chaka, were denied entry in the meeting, with only Cobra allowed to attend.","Sabo, Monkey D.

Episode 1118,The Holy Land in Tumult! Sai and Leo's Full-Power Blow!,"September 8, 2024","After obtaining the keys to the slaves' collars and meeting Bonney, Sabo heads to find the Lost Chamber. Meanwhile, Cobra asks the Five Elders about the fate of his ancestor Lili, though they have no information for him. Outside, Charlos uses Kuma to capture Shirahoshi, but he is stopped by Mjosgard allowing Sai and Leo to intervene; in the resulting chaos, the Revolutionary Army grabs Kuma and escapes. As he asks his second question regarding the mystery of the Will of D., Imu appears and sits on the Empty Throne, shocking Cobra.","Sabo battled through Pangaea Castle and obtained the keys to the slaves' collars, also encountering Bonney who was also looking to rescue Kuma. Sabo gave the keys to Karasu in his crow form so he could deliver it to the slaves. Sabo then helped escape with Bonney; while hiding from the guards, they heard a guard mentioning a Lost Chamber, piquing Sabo's interest. Once escaping the castle, they parted ways as Bonney sailed to Egghead to confront Vegapunk.
In the courtyard, Kuma had wrapped Shirahoshi in chains at Charlos' command. With Charlos intending to keep her as a slave, the other royals ran away, unwilling to confront a World Noble and risk execution. Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi, and Manboshi attempted to aid her, but were stopped by Kuma, who attacked them with a beam of light.
Suddenly, Donquixote Mjosgard appeared, officially authorizing both Sai and Leo to attack Charlos. They performed a joint attack which knocked Charlos unconscious, flattening him and making him appear dead to witnesses. Though Kuma attempted to retaliate, Morley appeared from the ground and grabbed Kuma. With Karasu having the keys and the mission being a success, Morley escaped with Kuma.
Meanwhile, Cobra met with the Five Elders in front of the Empty Throne. Cobra questioned them about Nefertari D. Lili, one of the First Twenty monarchs in the Void Century and the only one not to become a World Noble. Lili rejected the role and attempted to return to Arabasta, but mysteriously disappeared before she could return. Cobra asked the Five Elders why and why post-Void Century Arabastan records had no mentions of her. The Five Elders claimed not to know, but Cobra questioned further, asking about the meaning of Lili's middle initial D. Imu, overhearing the conversation, appears, and, to the shock of both Cobra and the Five Elders, sits on the Empty Throne, prepared to answer Cobra's questions.","Sabo, Jewelry Bonney, Karasu (crow; voice), Pell, Chaka, Nefertari Cobra, Ethanbaron V.

Episode 1119,The Entrusted Message! King Cobra's Resolve,"September 15, 2024","Imu tells Cobra about the truth of the Will of D. and the Poneglyphs and demands to know Lili's true name. Knowing they will kill him anyway, Cobra reveals her true name is Nefeltari D. Lili. Sabo intervenes and tries to escape with Cobra, but Cobra sacrifices himself to allow Sabo to flee, but not before he gives his final message for Luffy and Vivi. Wapol sees this and escapes in panic, to which Vivi uses this to escape from CP0 and the two flee Mary Geoise together.","Cobra is shocked and infuriated that Imu had sat on the throne that was meant to be empty. Imu reveals to Cobra the meaning of the D. initial; those with the Will of D. were united to conspire against the World Government. The enemies of the First Twenty as well as many Ohara scholars bore the initial. Furthermore, Lili's actions during the Void Century caused Poneglyphs to be spread around the world, which caused problems for the World Government. Imu wonders whether or not Lili spread them by accident, or she did so intentionally to plot against the government.
Suddenly, the Five Elders take out their weapons, prepared to kill Cobra since he saw Imu. Knowing that his death was inevitable, he decided to reveal that Lili's full name was Nefertari D. Lili, indicating she had the Will of D. With this, Imu sends out an spear-like appendage from his body, piercing through Cobra.
Sabo, who had been listening in, intervenes, attempting to rescue Cobra and attack Imu with his Devil Fruit abilities. A Den Den Mushi takes pictures of him near Cobra's body, and the Five Elders all transform into awakened Zoan forms. Sabo attempts to get away while carrying Cobra's body, but is too slow and is pierced by Imu. Cobra sacrifices himself so Sabo could escape alive, telling him to tell Luffy and Vivi that the entire Nefertari Family bears the name D.
Wapol, witnessing the incident through a peephole in the wall, enters a frenzied panic, afraid of being killed for having seen Imu. He chews through several walls, eventually entering the room where Vivi has been tied up. CP0 captured Vivi to make her ""disappear"" along with her father, with the intention of selling her as a slave to a World Noble. Fortunately, Wapol appears and chews right through the room, and Vivi sneaks out of the room in Wapol's mouth. As they both flee Mary Geoise, Wapol's wife, Kinderella, is outraged seeing Wapol with another woman.","Nefertari Cobra, Topman Warcury, Marcus Mars, Jaygarcia Saturn, Shepherd Ju Peter, Ethanbaron V.
