          "Big Mom rides to Udon where she and Tama express their love for red bean soup. Chopper fears that Big Mom will return to her normal self if she finds out that there was no red bean soup.\nHowever, Queen enjoys several bowls of the soup, revealing there was plenty of soup at Udon. Luffy continues to defeat the Pleasures with ease, so Queen decides to bring out the Gifters. Luffy is put against Batman, with advanced hearing, flight and a bow and arrow, and Gazelleman, with super speed. Despite this, Luffy defeats them relatively swiftly with Haki-imbued punches. Still, Luffy is disappointed that he could not defeat them without touching them like Rayleigh did.\nAt the bridge of Ringo, the sword thief, identified as Gyukimaru, battles against Zoro. He becomes angry when Zoro states that he met Ryuma. Gyukimaru explains Ryuma's significance. Several nobles in the past attempted to take over Wano Country but Ryuma was a formidable samurai who prevented them from doing so.\nTheir duel is interrupted by Komurasaki, who somehow survived Kyoshiro's attack, but is running away from an assassin, Hitokiri Kamazo, the slasher previously mentioned in the news. Kamazo intends to kill Toko for laughing and Komurasaki for disrespecting the shogun. Zoro helps Komurasaki in exchange for sake and food.\nZoro and Kamazo begin fighting, and the duel reaches a standstill as they seem equally matched. Zoro removes his outer garment, ready to fight harder."

          "After the devastating power of Kuma's Ursus Shock, everyone of the Straw Hat Pirates and the Rolling Pirates are knocked out. Kuma then takes this time to try and capture Luffy who is still worn out from his fight with Moria earlier. However, just as Kuma picks up Luffy, he is suddenly attacked by Zoro who slashes at him with Ittoryu Iai: Shishi Sonson. This attack manages to damage Kuma but Zoro is shocked to see cybernetic parts under Kuma. Zoro says he should've known that Kuma is a cyborg like Franky and Kuma fires a laser from his mouth that misses Zoro directly but the shockwave sends him flying.\nZoro is shocked to see that Kuma is able to fire a laser from his mouth and Kuma explains that he is a Pacifista. He continues on saying that a Pacifista is a creation designed to work for the World Government and says that he, himself, was created by the infamous Dr. Vegapunk. Zoro replies saying that Kuma has a major advantage being a Pacifista with Devil Fruit powers. Zoro also says that his body has given up on him but, not wanting to give up his captain's head, offers up his own life to Kuma. Zoro says his bounty may not be as high as Luffy's, but he is willing to give up his dream to become the world's greatest swordsmen in exchange. A surprised Kuma looks on how Zoro is willingly to give up his life and dream to make his captain's dream come true. Suddenly, Sanji gets up and offers up his life instead. However, Zoro, who already made up his mind, knocks Sanji out.\nZoro turns his attention back to Kuma who throws his swords in front of him and asks Kuma to show some honor. Kuma, after thinking for a while, agrees to Zoro's plea, saying that it wouldn't be honorable for him to still attack Luffy. Kuma, picking up Luffy, tells Zoro that he will spare Luffy but not before Zoro takes Luffy's place by experiencing all the pain he has endured during his time on Thriller Bark. Kuma then uses his powers to repel all the pain out of Luffy into a large, red mass of air. Kuma says that Zoro must take all of Luffy's pain if he really does want to take his place saying that the experience will kill Zoro as he is close to death. Kuma sends over a sample to Zoro and Zoro suffers intense pain from that small sample. Zoro falls to the ground but barely manages to make it back to his feet. Zoro then sticks his arms into the giant mass of pain. Kuma then remarks on Dragon having a good son.\nLater, the Straw Hats and the Rolling Pirates all regain consciousness. Franky is surprised to see Luffy acting well, who tells the crew that his body feels as good as new. As the other Straw Hats wonder why, Sanji runs off toward Zoro's direction. He reaches Zoro and asks what happened to the Warlord, but notices blood everywhere. Sanji asks Zoro what happened, and Zoro, who is covered head to toe in blood, says that nothing happened."

Zoro is seen talking to himself about his Flying Blade attack and he tried it out on a bird attempting to attack him, but he said the attack wasn't ready, thus searching for another thing to test this attack on. Chopper, running scared, is actually being chased by the Divine Soldiers, but they encounter a Shandia and ignore Chopper and fight one another. Robin, still at the ruins, is approached by a Divine Soldier who tells her to go this route leading to God's shrine. Robin, upset at the Divine Soldier for breaking some part of the ruins, defeats him.\nZoro, still making his way through the forest, is attacked by a Shandia warrior and Zoro punches him, knocking him out. In that moment, Braham defeats a Divine Soldier and proceeds to fight Zoro. Zoro initially tried to ignore the fight since Braham was not a priest. However, when Braham's attacks continued, Zoro prepared to fight him saying that he is glad Braham is not a second-rate flunkie. The Shandia and the Divine Soldiers are now engaged in battle and so are Braham and Zoro. Zoro was initially having problems fighting Braham because of the Jet Skis and Flash Guns that Braham has, thus making it a long-range battle. As the battle continues, Zoro decides to try his new technique. With Ittoryu - Sanjuroku Pound Ho, Zoro was able to defeat Braham and commented to himself about accepting the survival game.\nChopper, wailing about being left by the others, finds himself at the ruins and congratulates himself on being smart. Meanwhile, Gedatsu was in the same area and Chopper did not notice him. Luffy and Wyper continue their face-off and Wyper was shooting cannons at Luffy which Luffy rebounded using his Gomu Gomu no Mi abilities. Enel has visited the Straw Hats' ship and Sanji attempted at attacking but was defeated by Enel's Goro Goro no Mi abilities. Enel stated he had come without the intention of fighting and referred to Sanji as a foolish man. Gan Fall asked what his purpose of visit was, but Enel just told him it's been a long time since they met, and said that that is a cold-hearted way of greeting him."

Bill reveals to Desire that he used everyone in his Silver Pirate Alliance to give him wealth so that he could live the most luxurious life in the world, and questions whether she really intends to defeat him and if she really believes she is stronger than him. Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill. The Silver Pirate Alliance members attack Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire as Bill prepares to kill them all with a bazooka. However, Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to knock out the pirates and their battle boats, leaving Bill alone and shocked. Luffy sees where Bill is, and Bill fires a cannonball at him, but Luffy shatters it as he punches Bill into the underground mine.\nBill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.\nBartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island. At the coast, the Silver Pirate Alliance and the Sweet Pirates get everyone onto a large ship as they prepare to escape the island's destruction. The Sweet Pirates worry about Desire, but are forced to set sail. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Barto Club are worried about Luffy and Bartolomeo, but Zoro is confident that they are all right since Luffy's vivre card is fine. Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.\nLater in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles. Inside Gran Tesoro, Tanaka arrives and reports to the Monster of the New World, a man named Gild Tesoro. Tanaka reports that Bill sank along with Silver Mine, but Tesoro is fine as he already had his fun with Bill and now was time for the real entertainment to start."

Ryuma then uses Aubade Coup Droit, shooting bullets of air out of his sword. It would seem to be a draw, as the lab is about to cave-in. Brook knows that in Ryuma's former life, he was still a fearsome samurai.\nRyuma then thrusts his sword at Zoro with Prelude Au Fer to break his swords, with the latter retaliating with a Flash. It doesn't get through. He then uses a Demon Magma Bear, but the attack is also blocked. The zombie samurai then uses a Gavotte Bond en Avant, launching an intense thrust at his foe with Zoro using a Sword style Rashomon, dashing past each other. Ryuma takes the hit and the lab's structure begins to weaken.\nFranky hopes to take Brook to safety, while Zoro and Ryuma continue their fight using a 72-Caliber Phoenix and Polka Remise respectively on one another. Franky then fires a Weapons Left to make a safe exit. On the rooftop, the Straw Hat swordsman and the zombie samurai appear to be evenly matched even with limited movement. The two continue to swing their swords with Zoro about to lose his footing. Breathing heavily, Zoro worries that his swords will break if he keeps it up. Suddenly, a part of the roof is blasted. Zoro almost lands a Soaring Dragon and the skeleton uses an Arrow Notch Slash, wounding Zoro greatly. Just then, Ryuma is lit on fire.\nWith Zoro lying on the ground, Ryuma admits defeat. He passes Shusui onto his opponent as the sword has had a long history of owners. Zoro catches the sword and Ryuma believes he feels shame in his failure. Zoro wishes they could have met in the era when Ryuma was alive. Just then, Brook's shadow finally returns to its rightful owner, allowing Brook to walk around in broad daylight and he makes another skeletal joke. As Ryuma cremates, Zoro wants to pretend the fight never happened.\nUsopp runs down a hallway and hopes to inform his friends of his victory over Perona and dodges a group of Wild Zombies using an empty picture frame.\nElsewhere, a group of armored zombies are told by Hildon that the downed zombies were meant to restrain Oars. Just then, Oars arrives and the bat-like zombie orders a retreat. However, the zombie warriors try to charge at the giant zombie anyway, but Oars smashes through the generals. Remembering the orders, Oars continues his march.\nLuffy is now beginning to feel tired while Moria gloats how he can be Pirate King without lifting his fingers. The Doppelman then drops onto Luffy and then slams the Straw Hat captain around. Moria warns that his backup will be arriving any moment."

However, the group replies that they have never heard of him. This caused Brownbeard to be depressed and angered. He fires at them personally and manages to capsize the boat. After falling into the water, Zoro and Usopp carry Luffy and Robin respectively. Teeth chattering, Usopp complains about the temperature of the water. The centaurs prepare to fire the finishing blow and Zoro hands Luffy over to Usopp, saying that he is going to slice them up. Before he can unsheathe his sword, he is dragged into the water, his hands flailing above. Usopp panics and looks on in confusion before dunking his head into the water, discovering that there are sharks swimming around them. He questions why there are sharks in a lake and Brownbeard explains that due to the fight between the two Admirals, a crater is left behind. Seawater seeps in through the cracks, as did various sea creatures, which created the lake.\nThe Straw Hats are trapped and the centaurs fires. However, the guns exploded and they fall. The interference is revealed to be caused by Brook, who froze the gun barrels belonging to the centaurs. Brook attacks the centaurs and Brownbeard comments that he didn\u2019t know that there is another crew member. He says that it doesn\u2019t matter, since four of them have already become food for the sharks and asks Brook to take a look for himself. However, Brownbeard saw that the sharks are defeated.

Robin says that they are lucky to run into the centaurs and they each pick their targets, wanting to steal their warm clothes. Brownbeard recalls that Luffy is actually Ace\u2019s brother, and has a 400 million bounty, scaring the rest of the centaurs and they run. Robin and Luffy use their power to catch their target and Zoro fights a group of them. Brook comments that they are in better shape than he thought.\nIn front of the laboratory, Trafalgar Law says that he cannot let the Straw Hats escape and uses his powers to switch the four Straw Hats around. Their minds along with their voice are swapped into another body, causing a lot of confusion. Law slices up the warship and an iceberg. He joins the pieces together to form a tall wall, preventing the marines from leaving. The marines tell Law that he is breaking the contract between him and the government and that they are going to report the matter to the headquarters. However, Law calmly tells them not to worry about him, before using his skill, Scan. A pile of Den Den Mushi appears beside him, which is revealed to belong to the marines. Law informs them that he will not allow them to report anything about the island up to the government.\nSmoker rushes towards Law and attacks but he evades. Law retaliates but due to the nature of Smoker\u2019s ability, he cuts through the smoke. Smoker warns his crew to stay out of the reach of Law\u2019s sword but it is too late as they are sliced apart. Smoker instructs them to stay out of the circle created by Law and explains his power, comparing the sphere to an operating room. He further elaborates by stating that Law has absolute control over the items contained inside and can manipulate it according to his will, giving him his name, the Surgeon of Death. Tashigi rushes towards Law despite Smoker\u2019s warning about her Haki being not strong enough. True to his words, Tashigi\u2019s sword breaks and she is cut into two."

However, still needing \"excitement,\" Queen fires another round of Excite Bullets into the crowd.\nThe Straw Hats are now cornered by infected oni. Chopper deduces that Queen must have created an antibody to cure the virus, so he must acquire it from him to develop a cure. Queen announces that the virus will kill its victims in an hour at most. Apoo tries to escape the live floor but he finds that the gates are locked.\nQueen introduces a game he calls \"Ice Oni Tag\"; he gives a vial containing the only sample of the antibody to Apoo. The people must fight desperately for the antibody or else they would inevitably become infected themselves. The Straw Hats must win this game and acquire the sample to cure everyone. Queen performs an alternate version of his funk dance, with sadistic lyrics celebrating the bloodsport. He then begins the game, and Apoo is chased by the crowd for the vial.\nOn the rooftop, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi attack Kaidou but they are struck down with his spiked club, and they lose their Sulong forms.\nIn the right brain tower, Yamato decides to aid Shinobu. He reveals that he attended Oden's execution and heard Shinobu's speech. Sasaki's forces bombard Yamato with cannons, but he endures the barrage. Apologizing for not saving Momonosuke from the burning castle twenty years ago, Yamato introduces himself as Oden."

From the sidelines, Nami notices the wave changes in the ocean and realizes a Thrust-up Stream is coming. When Usopp asks what that is and asks if it is similar to the Knock-up Stream like the one that took them to Sky Island, Nami says it is, but smaller, but still has enough power to destroy a Marine ship.

Luffy is excited that he can try Panz Fry's cooking and Lily reveals she took some food from the Marines and while Zoro notes that that is odd, he changes his tone after seeing she took some sake also. As Luffy asks Panz Fry to make some food, Sanji kicks him stating he needs to rest and Chopper says that Luffy did not listen. However, Panz Fry says he will cook for them, despite Lily's protest stating that as a chef and giant, he was saved by the crew and would shame himself if he refused a request. He then thanks Luffy for saving him and says that he will cook the food.\nShuzo arrives at the location and notes they are out of torpedoes.

          "The episode starts with everyone exclaiming that the Mermaid Princess has been kidnapped. Luffy asks Shirahoshi why she got out of Megalo's mouth, she apologizes and asks him not to get mad at her as she starts to cry. As someone calls Luffy filthy and heartless, Chopper urges Sanji not to turn around. Sanji realizes that Chopper's warning can only mean that the Mermaid Princess is right behind him. Chopper tells him he is correct, but seeing the princess would without a doubt kill him if a normal mermaid made him lose so much blood before.\nAs Sanji begins to get lost in thought, he remembers hearing that even the most beautiful woman in the world, the pirate empress, would pale in comparison, and realizes that his dream is now in his grasp. He then tells Chopper that for the sake of his dreams, he chooses death \u2013 Chopper retorts by exclaiming that he thought that his dream was to find the All Blue. He turns around and looks at her. He realizes that he is gazing upon something that his imagination could never fathom, that no painting could ever capture. He then turns to stone, much to Chopper's shock.\nLuffy is examining Hatchan, trying to get Hachi to tell him who attacked him. Chopper wonders if Sanji turning to stone could be from a side effect of receiving okama blood. Shirahoshi cries and asks Luffy what she should do, but all of a sudden, the locals take action and tie up Luffy, Chopper, Hatchan, and the still petrified Sanji. Luffy asks them what they are doing, and the locals tell him not to underestimate the warriors of Fish-Man Island. One of the locals identifies Hatchan as a former member of Arlong's gang. Shirahoshi tries to explain to everyone that Luffy was only helping her, but the locals will not listen and promise to behead the pirates. Luffy then notices something and tells them that something is flying toward them from behind the crowd, but a local asks Luffy if he really thinks they are dumb enough to fall for that.\nSomeone then notices that Luffy is not lying, and everyone is shocked to see it is none other than Vander Decken IX. Decken yells that he found her, this time saying \"Of course I did\" instead of \"I think\". The locals are shocked that after hiding out for ten years, he now suddenly appeared on the island, and someone yells for Shirahoshi to run for it. Decken tells Shirahoshi to give him an answer, saying she will escape death if she says yes, telling her to run away with him and marry him. The locals are shocked to hear him ask for marriage after constantly attempting to take her life. Shirahoshi tells him she is sorry, but he is not her type.\nThe locals are comically stunned to find out that is why she will not marry him, and not his violent tendencies. Decken is crushed, and actually looks emotionally hurt. He tells her she should be ashamed of herself, because he has had feelings for her for the past ten years and then she steps all over them. He then asks her who she is planning to be with. He goes on to say that now that he knows her feelings toward him, her existence is now an eyesore. He gets ready to attack her as a local tells her to run, but Luffy tells her to wait, having now dubbed her 'scaredy cat'.\nA local grabs him by the collar, and asks him if he is working for Decken, and if he wants the princess to die. Luffy shouts that if she gets too far away from him, then he cannot protect her, so Shirahoshi tells Luffy she will remain with him. Decken then attacks Shirahoshi with another axe with a rose painted on it. Luffy tries to help, but is blocked by locals who still think he is trying to harm the princess. Luffy apologizes, saying he has nothing against them, then knocks them out with a burst of Haoshoku Haki because they are in his way. He then kicks off from the ground, flying toward Decken who is still on the coral. He does a flip in the air and brings his legs down on the coral, sending it crashing to the ground and knocking Decken off. The locals are amazed at Luffy's abilities, even when he is tied up.\nDecken asks Luffy why he is interfering with his and Shirahoshi's love, and figures that Luffy was the one who brought Shirahoshi out of the palace. And Luffy realizes that Decken was the one who had been throwing things at Shirahoshi as he gets ready to do an attack. Decken tells him he will take both of their lives, saying they would not be a pair, as they would be cut into a set of four. Luffy then uses a new technique, Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer, plowing Vander Decken IX into the ground head first. The locals are shocked to see that Luffy beat Vander Decken.\nThey then realize that Decken was still moving, despite being planted head first into the ground, and decide to capture him. Luffy headbutts Megalo, telling him to wake up and asks Sanji if he is alright. Chopper tells Luffy that Sanji had turned to stone earlier, but now he seems happy, and most importantly, conscious. Luffy tells Shirahoshi they need to go. Shirahoshi asks Luffy not to yell at her, as all the excitement has gotten her quite worked up. Luffy tells her that for some reason the island hates them, and they need to get out of here.\nShirahoshi unties Luffy, making the locals wonder why she is helping him. She apologizes to them, and tells them she will be home in time for dinner, which confuses them. The Straw Hats get on Megalo's back, and Shirahoshi grabs on to his jaws (much to his discomfort), as they get away. Just as they get away, Vander Decken IX gets his head out of the ground and swats away the people trying to capture him. Yelling that they will not get away, he calls on Wadatsumi and tells him to pound them into the ground. Wadatsumi gets ready to punch them, but Luffy beats him to it, and hits him in the face with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol, breaking one of his teeth. Decken seems upset that they got away.\nThe scene changes to the Ryugu Palace, where someone informs Jones that Nami and Camie had escaped. Jones tells him to ignore it. Nami and Camie are then seen escaping, with the former holding onto the latter's back with an air bubble around her head. Camie asks if it was ok for them to leave the others behind but Nami tells her to relax, as nothing good could come by worrying. Camie tells her she knows that they are all strong, but that Hatchan told her that Jones's mind is more dangerous than his strength. Nami then asks her what kind of person Jinbe is. Camie replies that he is a pirate who is popular at the Ryugu Palace and can come and go as he pleases. Nami remembers that he was also in the same crew as Arlong, and that Jones is the successor to Arlong's will.\nShe then mentions one of Jinbe's messages to Luffy, \"Don't fight Hody\". Nami adds that she thinks she has figured out what the message means. Camie tells her she thought it only meant that Jones is dangerous. Nami adds that it is okay for Zoro and the others to get Jones angry. She then tells Camie she wants to meet Jinbe, and remembers he is waiting at the Sea Forest. Nami says that the situation seems to have a long and deep-rooted history, and has a feeling that Jinbe knows all about it. She then asks Camie to head to the sea forest.\nBack in the palace, Neptune is giving orders to his guards. The soldiers tell him they will take care of Jones and the pirates. Neptune tells them not to. He tells them that even though he did not get a chance to fight, they all ended up as victims. He orders them to surrender the castle for now, reunite with Fukaboshi, and get ready for the rematch.\nThe guards are shocked at the orders. Usopp and Brook are in the water. Usopp wonders what Zoro can do to fight a fish-man in the water as Brook tells Usopp he is not going to make it. The episode ends with Zoro seemingly defeating Jones with a single slash, and the New Fish-Man Pirates astounded at what happened to their captain, with Usopp looking on in shock."

          "With Crocodile lying on the ground, Luffy demands that he get up and fight. Crocodile laughs at this statement.\nMeanwhile, Vivi and the rest of the Straw Hats are in the Palace Square. Vivi explains that according to Crocodile, within ten minutes, a huge cannon will be fired, and once the cannon is fired, no one within a five-kilometer radius will survive, wiping out both the Rebel and Royal Army forces. Zoro tells them that they need to find the cannon and stop the cannoneer from shooting. Before they can go ahead and look for the cannon, some Baroque Works Billions find Vivi and try to bring her to Crocodile for a promotion. Sanji and Zoro volunteer to stay behind to deal with the agents while the others go ahead and split up to look for the cannon.\nCrocodile is still laughing at Luffy's statement, telling him that it will not be so easy to defeat him, since he is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy is unimpressed and says that if Crocodile is one of the Seven Warlords, then he is the eighth Warlord. Cobra cannot believe what he is hearing and is impressed by Luffy's confidence. He asks who Luffy is, and Miss All Sunday tells him that he is the one responsible for bringing Vivi back to Arabasta.\nEven though Luffy has figured out how to land a punch on Crocodile, the Warlord is still confident stating that even though Luffy can hit him, he can still absorb any fluid in Luffy's body. He proceeds to dehydrate Luffy's arm, which Luffy counters by drinking more water. The two continue their battle and Luffy reveals that he was planning to throw the barrel of water he was carrying to douse Crocodile in water. Crocodile predicts this move and counters it by conjuring a twister of sand, sending both Luffy and the barrel flying away. Luffy barely catches the barrel of water. Crocodile laughs at Luffy, telling him that this battle is no different from the first time they fought. Luffy proceeds to drink the whole barrel of water he was carrying and dubs himself as Water Luffy, showing a bloated stomach full of water, which shocks both Crocodile and Cobra and amuses Miss All Sunday.\nCobra attacks Luffy but Luffy squirts out water from his mouth and douses Crocodile with water, just as he planned, making the Warlord susceptible to Luffy's physical attacks. Luffy uses his Gomu Gomu no Bazooka technique and hits Crocodile directly to his stomach which sends him crashing. Crocodile is lying on the ground, not moving. Miss All Sunday removes the stakes impaling Cobra and demands that he show her the way to the Poneglyph. Cobra asks what she wants with it, but she subdues him and reiterates her demand.\nCrocodile gets up and calls Miss All Sunday by her real name, Nico Robin, telling her that she should get going now to the Poneglyphs. As Nico Robin and the King leave, Crocodile uses his Ground Secco technique which dehydrates all of their surroundings turning it to a desert wasteland. Luffy shoots water at Crocodile which he simply absorbs with his hand. He continues to suck the moisture out of ground, the effects of which are felt throughout the palace.\nWith eight minutes left until the explosion, Vivi, Pell and the rest of the Straw Hats scramble to find the cannon.\nMeanwhile, Cobra asks if Nico Robin is truly Miss All Sunday's name. He remembers that the name was known throughout the world twenty years ago. On their way to the Poneglyphs, they encounter Tashigi and a bunch of Marines. Tashigi refuses to let them pass, but Robin uses her abilities to incapacitate some of her men. Seeing the ability, a Marine recognizes who she is and tells Tashigi that twenty years ago, when she was eight years old, Robin earned a bounty of 79,000,000 for sinking six Marine ships, classifying her as a first-degree risk. After the incident, she was said to have vanished and never heard from again. After hearing about her reputation, Tashigi commands her men to go to the Palace Square to stop the explosion, deeming it useless for so many men to fight against someone with her power. She stays behind, deciding to fight her, but Robin uses her ability against Tashigi and easily defeats her.\nIn the palace, the entire lawn has turned to sand. Crocodile is able to sneak up on Luffy and grab him by the neck. Luffy spits water at Crocodile but misses and he proceeds to absorb all of the water in Luffy's body, dehydrating him. Luffy's signature straw hat is shown to be blown away by the wind. While still holding Luffy by the neck, Crocodile declares that Luffy has lost to him for the second time."

          "Ace starts fighting Smoker while the crew is running away to the Going Merry. As they flee, Nami asks Luffy if Ace is really his brother. Luffy confirms this and tells them his name. A bifurcation is in their way and Nami tells everyone to follow her, but Luffy goes the other way, as he was watching his brother fight. The Straw Hats arrive at the ship and carry all the supplies, only to notice that Luffy is missing. Luffy is sitting on the barrel he was carrying in an alley, but he does not know where his crew went. Ace greets him from the top of a house in the alley and then comes down. They start arm wrestling on top of the barrel Luffy was sitting on, but after struggling, the barrel breaks and the water inside it scatters. They both agree that they are equally strong. Ace invites Luffy and his crew to join the Whitebeard Pirates, but Luffy declines.\nOn Smoker's ship, Mr. 11 is left alone, tied to the mast. Some Billions get on the deck and Mr. 11 asks them to untie him. They explain that as Billions, they are candidates to be promoted to Officer Agents. Mr. 11 asks them to untie him again, but they shoot him. The Billions get off the ship and someone informs them that Fire Fist Ace is in the town. One of them then comments that if they take down Ace, they will surely be promoted to Officer Agents.\nLuffy and Ace start searching for Luffy's crew, but as they walk, Billions start to surround them without being noticed. After they are gathered, everyone comes out. Luffy and Ace do not care what they say and keep walking but the Billions start a fight. After Luffy sends the leader flying with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, one of the Billions tells his comrades not to be scared by that, and everyone keeps chasing them again. Luffy spots his ship and stretches his arms in order to reach for it. He enters the ship ramming towards Sanji and Chopper. Ace reaches the ship in his boat, but then they spot five Billions ships coming towards them. Ace tells Luffy that he can handle them, gets in his boat, and starts propelling it with the help of his flames. He then jumps over a ship and when he lands, he launches a Hiken, destroying the five ships consecutively.\nSmoker is talking to Tashigi and asks what Nefertari Vivi was doing with the Straw Hats. Tashigi proposes that perhaps she was a hostage to a major scheme, but Smoker does not think so. He thinks that is unlikely since she was getting along with the group as if she was one of them. He says that something big is going to occur and that he may know where they are heading after Luffy told him he only wanted to beat Crocodile. Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper in the Going Merry are toasting for Ace joining the Straw Hats, but Ace tells them he is not joining them. After that, he explains that he is in search for Blackbeard after he killed one of his crewmates. He also explains that he is heading to Yuba, and Nami tells him that they are going to the same place. Vivi proceeds to explain the route and after that, they toast for having a fun time together."

He asks Paulie if there's a ship he could borrow to get them there, or better yet, a sea train. Paulie informs them that the sea train was built by a team headed by a legendary shipwright and there's nothing else like it in existence in the world and if they were to set out, they would immediately get killed so they would do better to wait until morning.\nAt that moment Nami remembers reading about Enies Lobby and the Gates of Justice - a set of large steel gates beyond which people only find despair. Enies Lobby is known as the Judicial Island and has a judicial court located on it. However, it functions as such in name only; if you're taken to Enies Lobby, you're already considered guilty. Beyond the Gates of Justice lie two locations, one is the Marine Headquarters and the other is Impel Down - an undersea prison reserved for the criminals who once ran amok in the world. Robin, who has a bounty on her head, would only suffer pain once she crossed those doors.\nPaulie tells them that they shouldn't go there because they are pirates too and would get caught. Luffy declares he is going and he would steal a ship to get there. Paulie and Luffy are about to fight, when Kokoro stops them and asks Luffy to follow her if they didn't fear death.\nSanji gets to the railcar where Franky and Usopp are tied up and after defeating all the officers inside, Sanji and Franky get into an argument that Usopp unsuccessfully tries to stop. There are several Den Den Mushi there which Sanji plans to use to call Nami. But the argument is loud enough that Captain T Bone who is in the next car is alerted and draws his sword to check the commotion.\nKokoro leads Luffy, Zoro and Chopper to the unused sea train, Rocketman. It is a sea train which wasn't used because its speed couldn't be controlled. Iceburg is already at the train and has serviced it and filled it with coal enough to last the trip. After he is thanked by Luffy, Iceburg tells him that he can thank him later if he isn't killed by the train ride.\nNami comes there bringing with her the two conductors who are carting in meat and drinks, and both Zoro and Luffy dig in and thank her. While he is eating, the Franky Family members come in and beg Luffy to be let to ride with them to go and rescue Franky. While Nami opposes, Luffy just tells them to get in; however, they would ride on king bulls and need only hold on to the train as it went.\nThe gang get on and the train is ready to depart with Kokoro piloting the Rocketman as she tells Iceburg to rest up, and that Franky would be okay, as he got hit by a Sea Train and survived. Paulie also sneaks onboard the train as it is leaving while Luffy gets on top of the train and holds on. He yells that they are going to get everything back as the train departs."

Kawamatsu fights them off, and explains what happened after he lost Hiyori.\nThirteen years ago, after Hiyori ran away, he decided to leave to Ringo. Ringo was a region that was previously ruled by the daimyo Shimotsuki Ushimaru, who was with the company of a fox, Onimaru. However, when Orochi overthrew Oden, Ushimaru was killed and Ringo fell.\nKawamatsu found a mass burial site with Eternal Graves. These corpses were buried in caskets and did not decompose due to the cold. They were marked by the deceased person's sword, which was said to contain the soul of the deceased. These swords became attractive to grave robbers, but the graveyard was guarded by the fox, Onimaru.\nOnimaru was initially hostile to Kawamatsu but eventually warmed up to him. However, he became hostile again after he saw Kawamatsu taking the swords from the graves. Kawamatsu explained that the swords were to be used for the upcoming Onigashima raid. Given that the samurai in the swords will help their wielders in battle, Onimaru allowed him, helping him gather the other swords.\nTogether they would build a hideout to keep the swords, steal food from the capital to keep themselves fed, and fight off any grave robbers, taking their swords. Unfortunately, when Kawamatsu attempted to steal tofu one day, he fell into a trap and was arrested, being sent to the Udon prisoner mine.\nBack in present day, Kawamatsu goes to the place where Gyukimaru disappeared, and finds that it is the location where the swords were located. He contacts Kin'emon and tells him that he has the supply of swords needed for the army. It is revealed that Gyukimaru was the one who arranged the swords while Kawamatsu was gone, as he was actually Onimaru in his human form. He transforms back into his fox form and leaves, his duty fulfilled.\nZoro tries to take back Shusui, but Hiyori asks him to leave it. Hiyori offers him a replacement sword, the Enma. This sword belonged to Oden himself and is the only sword to have ever successfully injured Kaidou."

They are attacked by one of the Numbers, Hatcha, a mace-wielding giant. A fired explosive arrow knocks Hatcha back, allowing Kid, Luffy and Zoro to escape to the castle while Wire and Heat hold Hatcha back. However, they are pursued by Apoo's sound attacks. Killer suggests covering their ears. This makes them immune to Apoo's attacks, since they only work if the target can hear the sound waves.

The Big Mom Pirates, led by Perospero, ride up the waterfall, approaching the country.\nChopper's group with the tank joins Kin'emon's forces up the east mountain path. Kin'emon discusses the plan. The group will split into another two groups; one group will enter through the side of the Skull Dome and the other through the back. This will allow them to attack Orochi and Kaidou from two angles.

Although Nami and Carrot's group encounters enemy Beasts Pirates, they use their good looks to charm their way through.\nUnfortunately, Kin'emon's group finds that the island blueprints were out of date, and the castle has been expanded since it was made. The forces encounter a pond on the eastern mountain path. Sanji finds a pleasure hall owned by Black Maria, but finds it empty since Kaidou's subordinates have left in search of the intruders. Nami, Carrot and Shinobu decide to break away from the group to search for Momonosuke.\nApoo explains what happened to Killer.

          "This episode starts with a recap of the previous episode and opens with Kuro arriving at the north slope, very angry that his plan did not go as planned. Jango and the rest of the Black Cat Pirates are terrified by him, including Sham and Buchi. He can\u2019t believe that his former crew was held back by a bunch of children. He asks Jango for an explanation. Jango reminds Kuro who said letting Usopp go would not cause any problems. Kuro said that he knew that Usopp would try in vain to stop the Black Cat Pirates from invading Syrup Village since no one would believe him, but the one thing he didn\u2019t count on was the weakness of his crew.\nThis remark made Sham and Buchi very mad. They remembered Kuro as a strong killer and said they were sinking ships and vanquishing pirate crews while Kuro lived the good life. They accused him of becoming weak. They go straight to him, hoping to kill him. Jango tries to warn them, but it was no use. Before they could deal him a blow, he suddenly disappeared. And reappeared moments later behind them with his Cat Claws gloves on his hands. It surprised even Zoro. They tried to attack him again, but he disappeared one more time. Jango recognized this move as the Nukiashi technique, Kuro\u2019s trademark attack. He reappeared behind Sham and Buchi again, with his claw-like knives pointing at them. Even Nami is impressed by this, as the Nyaban Brothers nearly defeated Zoro. This silent technique is so powerful, not even a group of 50 assassins could stop Kuro. Jango knew he hasn\u2019t lost that attack by the way he always lifted his glasses to avoid being cut by his Cat Claws gloves.\nNami managed to get up despite her wound. Kuro gave his crew 5 minutes to kill Zoro. Otherwise, he will kill them all. Sham and Buchi go straight to Zoro to kill him. Jango encourages them to stop him. Nami kicks the two swords straight to Zoro. The swordsman managed to get them. Although a little upset that Nami kicks his swords without any respect, Zoro thanks her for giving him back his swords and he defeats the Nyaban Brothers by using the Tora Gari technique. Kuro is still counting the minutes. Usopp and the Black Cat Pirates are surprised by the swordsman\u2019s attack. Even Jango is shocked by it.\nZoro said to Kuro that the former captain will be defeated in less than 5 minutes. Kuro is a little impressed. Buchi is still conscious and begs Jango to hypnotize him so he will become strong enough to defeat Zoro. Jango managed to do so and Zoro decided to deal with Buchi before he can fight Kuro. After being hypnotized, Buchi becomes stronger and more savage than before. His muscles even increased in size. That surprised Zoro, but he managed to regain his calm and decided to fight him no matter what happens. Meanwhile, Nami goes to wake up Luffy who is sleeping beneath the figurehead of the Bezan Black. She managed to wake him up by pressing her foot into his head. Luffy woke up just in time to stop Jango\u2019s pendulum from killing Nami with his bare teeth while arguing with Nami for the way she wakes people up. Nami learned that Jango\u2019s pendulum is also used as a weapon. Luffy broke the pendulum with his bare teeth, although it hurts him a little bit.\nThe Black Cat Pirates begin to think it will be impossible to defeat Luffy and Zoro since they appeared to be very strong. After waking up Luffy, Nami passes out for a bit. The pirates run from Luffy, scared for their life. While Buchi fights Zoro, Jango will deal with Luffy. Kuro said that time is up and he will kill everyone on the north slope. He is also surprised that Luffy survived the fall from the cliff since he thought that fall would have killed him.\nBefore Kuro could kill anyone, Kaya arrives and begs him to stop. Usopp managed to save her before Kuro slashes her. She said to Usopp that she could not bare to see him get hurt protecting her. She then talks to Kuro and said he can take her fortune and leave the village alone. Kuro said to Kaya he wants more than her fortune. He wants peace. He said, despite her plea, the Black Cat Pirates will still attack Syrup Village and kill her. She then pulled a gun from her coat and pointed it at Kuro. She threatens to kill him if Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates don\u2019t leave the island this instant. Kuro managed to lower her guard down by talking about the last 3 years they spent together. He also said that spending 3 years with her was an insult to his pride as a pirate. He takes the gun from her and throws it to the ground.\nUsopp takes the gun and tries to shoot Kuro down, but Kuro used his Nuki Ashi to reappear behind the liar with his Cat Claws gloves on. He tried to kill him to make him pay for punching him, but his attempts were stopped by Luffy who gave him a Gomu Gomu no Pistol, sending him to the ground. Luffy swears Kuro will have a bad day since he hates being punched."

          "The Straw Hat Pirates, Franky, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe leap into the sea to find the Going Merry waiting for them. It takes a moment for the Marines of the Buster Call to realize what's happening. As the rope ladder seemingly drops on its own, Sanji and Nami climb aboard. As Zoro carries Chimney and Gonbe up with him, Franky brings Usopp, and Kokoro tosses Luffy, Robin, and Chopper aboard before climbing on, Sanji starts wondering how the Merry got here and who threw down the rope ladder. Many of the Straw Hats are choking back emotion at being back aboard their ship. Even Franky is wondering just how she got here after being dumped from his hideout by CP9. Luffy tries to thank Robin for getting him out of the tower, but a Fleur covers his mouth. Instead it is Robin who thanks everyone for saving her even when she felt she wasn't worth saving. In the emotional exchange, Chopper regains his ability to move. The Straw Hats soon organize and make plans to escape Enies Lobby.\nSpandam is livid and orders all guns on the Merry, even if it means killing Robin. Spandam justifies it (falsely) as orders from Aokiji that Robin is to be killed if she cannot be captured. But when the cannons fire, the shot miss the Merry and hit each other instead. Then, two of the ships crash into each other. Eventually, the Marines discover the reason for their loss of control: the Gates of Justice are closing, meaning the whirlpool currents are returning. Usopp then realizes this was the reason for Sanji's absence earlier. He had been in the third tower looking for the gates' operating lever. Thanks to his thinking ahead, they now have a fighting chance.\nAs the Merry speeds along, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, and Franky fend off cannonballs from the battleships. Eventually, Luffy crawls his way to the stern using his mouth and insists he join in the fight. Eventually, Zoro and Sanji decide to quiet him by stretching his body like a net and using him to catch and return a large salvo of the cannonballs. Eventually, Nami computes a course along the whirlpool currents, allowing them to outrace the cannonballs. Spandam goes into a tirade over how the mightiest force in the world can't defeat one pirate crew and capture one woman. The tirade eventually stops when the \"hands\" of Nico Robin envelop him and begin to bend him backwards. After all the physical and mental abuse he had inflicted upon her, everyone knew what was coming. With a final, cathartic, \"Clutch!\", Spandam's spine snaps in two and Robin gets her revenge. Nami then directs Franky to finish their escape. With apologies to the crew and ship, Franky fires his Coup de Vent, launching the Merry clear of the whirlpools, the Buster Call, and Enies Lobby altogether. A final Smoke Star from Usopp ensures they cannot pursue.\nMeanwhile, back at the Enies Lobby Front Gate, Zambai, Paulie, and the rest of the invasion force have boarded Puffing Tom and are starting their way back to Water 7. Lulu and Tilestone reflect on what's just happened while Mozu and Kiwi appreciatively cuddle up to Paulie in spite of his protests: resulting in a massive nosebleed from him. Everyone is in high spirits as in spite of bumps, bruises, and broken bones, they have taken on the World Government and made it out alive.\nEventually, Admiral Aokiji makes his way to Enies Lobby personally. The Buster Call is adamant in pursuing the Straw Hats, but Aokiji firmly orders everyone to stand down. There is no way to salvage the day now. The Buster Call is supposed to comprise a force equivalent to that of an entire country, yet their current situation is anything but proud and strong. Two ships are sunk, several more are severely damaged. And Enies Lobby stands a smoldering ruin: one of the great strongholds of the entire World Government destroyed. Something this catastrophic cannot be disguised or sugar-coated. The World Government has suffered a complete and utter defeat this day.\nAt his insistence, Kokoro positions Luffy at his customary position atop the Merry's figurehead. Luffy thanks Merry for coming to their rescue. He also thanks Franky for helping out. Franky has to appreciate the sheer audacity of the Straw Hats and cautions the World Government will be coming after them with a fervor now, but the Straw Hats don't care. To them, saving their friend was more important than defying the World Government and in this most important regard, they have won."

          "The island of Dressrosa begins trembling as the Birdcage begins closing in on itself, and the citizens watch in shock as the strings slice the buildings into pieces. They then run toward the downtown, struggling to outpace the cage. Marines stationed on all corners of the island report that the cage is moving inwards. On the palace rooftop, Doflamingo reveals to an angered Luffy that the Birdcage is shrinking, which shocks the pirate as the Birdcage cuts up an aqueduct, flooding a large part of town. Doflamingo says that everything will be cut up in about one hour as the Marines head out to help the people at the edge of the country.\nOne of them helps an injured man up as another orders the citizens to run to the center of town. Meanwhile, some pirates, citizens, and a gorilla are tied up, begging to be untied so they can escape the cage. On the King's Plateau, Viola, Usopp, Zoro, Hack, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro react to the shrinking Birdcage, and near the Corrida Colosseum, the recently freed prisoner gladiators are shocked to find that after being freed from their prison, they are still being held captive. Below the King's Plateau, Riku curses Doflamingo for his destruction as a citizen near him begins losing hope. The fighters on the second and fourth levels of the palace plateau react to the shrinking cage as Robin looks up to the palace, and on the King's Plateau, Usopp begs Luffy to beat Doflamingo while Kin'emon realizes that everyone's lives are now dependent on Luffy.\nOn the palace rooftop, Doflamingo says that he will save nobody and that people who knew the country's secret should not be allowed to live. Meanwhile, as the citizens run toward the center of town, Sabo runs in the opposite direction. Doflamingo mockingly tells Luffy that he and all his friends would die just like Bellamy and Law already had, and Dressrosa would perish, though Doflamingo could just build another country. Luffy then rushes toward Doflamingo, saying he could stop that if he beat the Shichibukai, and Doflamingo hurls strings at him. Luffy dodges the strings and barrages Doflamingo with Haki-enhanced punches, but Doflamingo sends him hurtling to the ground with Fulbright. Luffy gets up, rushes toward Doflamingo again, and prepares an attack. Doflamingo prepares to shoot him, when Law suddenly switches places with Luffy and stabs an astonished Doflamingo with Gamma Knife.\nLaw tells Doflamingo that this attack will destroy him from the inside out as Doflamingo coughs up blood, shocking Trebol. Trebol asks Law how he is still alive and how he used an Ope Ope no Mi attack without creating a ROOM. Law reveals that he already made a ROOM which encompassed the entire palace plateau and was too large for them to see, at the cost of his lifespan. Law recalls how he was shot by Doflamingo, but the wound was not fatal. He then switched himself with a fallen Donquixote Pirate on the level below, and switched back after Doflamingo finished shooting his body double. When Luffy discovered his body, Law revealed that he was still alive and that he had a plan.\nThe Gamma Knife causes Doflamingo to sink to his knees, and a shocked Trebol tells him that a king should never be on their knees. However, an angered Doflamingo grabs Law's face and prepares to shoot him, though Law accepts it since Doflamingo will still die. However, Luffy arrives and kicks Doflamingo in the face with Gear Second, sending the Shichibukai flying and landing backfirst in a pile of rubble. Law then remembers how he met Corazon and how Corazon fought to save his life. Luffy races toward Doflamingo, but Law stops him, saying it was his job to finish the Shichibukai off. After struggling to drag himself to Doflamingo, Law stands up and creates a ROOM, ready to deal the finishing blow."

Vegapunk remembers how he created the paw; he was aware that Kuma's abilities allowed him to store pain in paws, but also wondered whether one's memories could also be stored in a similar way. So, before being turned into a cyborg and losing his free will, Kuma discovered a way to store his memories in the paw. In the present day, Vegapunk attempts to deceive Bonney by telling her that the paw was filled with pain, but Bonney does not believe him and recognizes the paw as Kuma's memories.\nAt the Red Line, Kuma continues climbing the mountain. However, in order to prevent him from reaching Mary Geoise, Marine forces shoot Kuma down, sending him falling back to the ground. Kuma attacks the Marines with his abilities before reattempting to climb the Red Line.\nMeanwhile, Zoro battles Kaku, but Kaku reveals his awakened Devil Fruit form, enhancing his speed and allowing him to bend his neck in previously-impossible ways. Kaku initially overwhelms Zoro with his new attacks, but Zoro, having strengthened from his battle with Kaidou, fights back. Kaku sends the Seraphim, who have also passed through the Frontier Dome, to attack the laboratory Vegapunk is hiding inside. Shaka's group watches as the building is bombarded by the Seraphim's attacks.\nSuddenly, Stussy defects against the agents, transforming herself into a bat-like form and attacking Kaku by surprise. Biting into his neck, Stussy sucks his blood, causing him to lose consciousness from blood loss. Stussy is revealed to be a clone created by MADS, modeled after former Rocks Pirate Miss Buckingham Stussy. Lucci attempts to fight against Stussy, but Stussy evades his attack with a form of Kami-e, uses Seastone lipstick to nullify his powers, then sucks his blood, causing him to also lose consciousness. She then turns to Zoro."

          "As Luffy, Zoro and Viola advance through the castle, they notice that no guards are chasing them. At this moment, a face begins to form from the castle walls, getting bigger until it produces a full body. Viola curses as this stone monster is Pica of the Spade seat.\nAt the Royal Palace, Luffy's group stands before Pica, an executive officer. Viola reveals that he has eaten the Ishi Ishi no Mi which allows him to merge himself with any type of rock and he has currently merged himself with the palace which is made entirely of stone.This allows him to control the entire palace. He then attempts to crush Luffy and his group between the walls of the palace.\nMeanwhile, at the Underground Factory, Usopp notes that toys just keep coming out of the Factory proving that Sugar is in the Factory. He then asks the Dwarves what the tentacle-like things that are connected to the tower are. They explain to him that the one in the center is a lift that leads to the palace while the pipe-like things are tubes that reach the Scrap Heap. It takes people and broken toys from various places and drops them into the Scrap Heap which is below the Officer Tower.\nInside the Officer Tower, Cavendish is with Trebol and Sugar. Trebol tells him that he is in the Officer Tower which is a Factory-like room from toys are continuously spit out and that it is also known by another name. It is revealed that Trebol has eaten the Beta Beta no Mi. Trebol says that he will not listen to what a brat like him has to say. Cavendish orders Sugar to get the sticky substance by which he is bound off him, but she instead turns him into a toy and makes a contract with him without him even agreeing. The contract states that he will not harm humans and will bow to the orders of the Doflamingo Family. Almost immediately Cavendish loses his free will. Trebol states that now no one remembers who he is and now onwards he will, as a toy, have to work and die for Doflamingo. As a toy he is forced to work with the other toys to smuggle weapons. It is revealed that the other contestants who were taken to the infirmary were also made into toys and are being forced to smuggle weapons.\nUsopp, Robin, and their group of dwarves reach the room where Trebol and Sugar are located. The dwarves state that Sugar loves eating grapes. So their plan is to put a solid ball of the world's hottest spice, Tatabababasco, which they've made to look like a grape, into her basket of grapes. The seasoning is so spicy that when it was tested 50 times on the dwarves all of them fainted and 18 of them were on the verge of dying. Usopp tells Leo to go ahead and execute the plan and he will stay back and cover him although in his mind he intends to run away if the plan fails. Leo steps up to place the ball of Tatababasco into the basket as the other dwarves cheer him on. He says that when Sugar cries out, it will be the sign that all the toys will become human again and all their forgotten memories will return and the evil deeds of Doflamingo be brought to light and his true colors will be revealed to everyone! He shouts that he is going to save his friends and return the Kingdom back to King Riku."

Usopp replies that, unlike previous enemies, he is well aware of what Luffy is capable of, and is ready to defeat him. He tells Luffy to come at him with everything he has. The rest of the Straw Hat Pirates watch from the deck of the Going Merry with varying degrees of concern.\nUsopp starts with some of the boasts he made when they first met. When Luffy comes at him with Gomu Gomu no Pistol, Usopp uses his Hissatsu Ketchup Boshi to fake coughing up blood. This stops Luffy in his tracks out of concern. Usopp mocks him for showing pity on the enemy, and blinds him with a Flash Dial, then hits him with Hissatsu Tamago Boshi, pelting his former captain with rotten eggs. Luffy tells Usopp to get serious; Usopp says he is, reminding him that this is how he fights. Usopp shoots Hissatsu Tabasco Boshi right in Luffy's mouth, making him spit fire and fall back right onto a pile of caltrops, scratching up his body. When Luffy gets up, Usopp knocks him back down with Hissatsu Koshou Boshi, which explodes in a cloud of ground pepper. Luffy coughs in fits and repeatedly lands in the caltrops.\nLuffy recovers enough to finally get out of the caltrops, remarking how much it hurts. Usopp says he will not give Luffy a chance to retaliate, and starts to amp up the danger with Shuriken Ryuuseigun, firing strings of throwing stars at Luffy, forcing him to focus on dodging. He gets in an area that appears to be smoky. Usopp says it is actually gas coming from a Breath Dial, but he could not smell it because of the rotten eggs. Usopp fires Kaen Boshi, setting off a tremendous explosion that throws Going Merry back from the shore. For a moment, Luffy lays on the ground and thinks about the past with Usopp. The water thrown up by the explosion makes it look like the ship itself is crying.\nUsopp remarks he knows that explosion would not kill Luffy. Luffy tries to attack with Gomu Gomu no Gatling, but Usopp responds with Sakuretsu Saboteso Boshi, which explodes on Luffy's fist and pummels Luffy with small pins. Usopp fires several Sanren Kayaku Boshi at Luffy, forcing him to dodge the resulting explosions. Luffy finally knocks Usopp back with Gomu Gomu no Pistol. But when he tries Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, Usopp catches it with an Impact Dial and dishes it back out on Luffy, knocking Luffy back, but also injuring his arm with the recoil. That was the last of Usopp's tricks. Out of ideas, he stands there and takes it as Luffy fires Gomu Gomu no Bullet, punching him hard in the chest and knocking him out, winning the duel.\nPutting his straw hat back on, Luffy tells Usopp that he can keep the Going Merry, and bids him goodbye. Chopper wants to treat him, but Sanji stops him, saying it is wrong to show pity on the loser of a duel. Chopper still leaves some supplies for him to help treat himself. As he returns to the ship, Luffy tears up, commenting on the heavy burden. Zoro responds that it is the burden of the captain, and the rest of the crew relies on him to bear it. As Luffy, Chopper, and Nami tear up over this turn of events, the crew then leaves the ship, and a crying Usopp, behind."

Enel, upset at Usopp, takes him out with his Goro Goro no Mi. Enel then told Gan Fall that the Divine Squad members, who he seized six years ago, have been working long and hard till this day without rest. He also told Gan Fall that his need for Sky Island is also complete. Enel stated that the people of Skypiea are ignorant in seeing the Upper Yard as only a land of Vearth. He stated that the Straw Hats, his crew and the Shandia all seek the City of Gold.\nAfter his discussion with Gan Fall, Enel left saying he is also a partaker in the final game and responded to Gan Fall's inquiry about his Divine Squad leaving Enel's forced labor as \"something only God knows\".

Luffy and Wyper battle for some time and eventually throw each other off after both launching a Bazooka-like attack on each other. Wyper thought it would be better not to kill Luffy and save his energy to kill Enel. Just as Luffy answers him, Luffy is swallowed by the Giant Python, leaving Wyper to wonder where Luffy had gone.\nGenbo and the Divine Soldiers battle and he easily overwhelms them. Yama then appears before Genbo. Genbo shoots an iron cannonball at Yama, which he dodges and kicks the iron cannonball back and damages Genbo. Genbo, refusing to be defeated, makes Yama launch the Ten-Fold Axe: Axe Mountain attack on Genbo and defeats him.\nWhile on the Going Merry, Nami and Gan Fall prepare for their battle with Kotori and Hotori. Luffy finds himself in an unidentifiable location. Chopper is still searching the ruins for the rest of the exploration crew where he comes in contact with Gedatsu."

          "Franky continues to call out to Luffy urging for a fight. Luffy is confused on how the stranger knows his name but Nami quickly informs in that is Franky. Luffy then finally recognizes that man responsible for beating up Usopp and calls out to Franky wanting to fight.\nBack at the hospital, Kalifa informs the others of the Galley-La Company that Iceburg is now awake but still badly injured and can go into his room to see him. Paulie informs Iceburg that he and the rest of the company will watch over the shipyard until he recovers. Iceburg then immediately tells the others that he remembers who attacked him and says that one of them was with the Straw Hat Pirates indicating Nico Robin. Outside, the people are excited to hear that Iceburg is awake.\nBack at the shipyard, Franky taunts Luffy about attacking his gang and destroying his house. Nami only wants their money back but Franky says that he has already spent it. However, Luffy doesn't care about the money and wants revenge. The people suddenly start to move away as Franky suddenly starts taking in a large amount of air. Franky then suddenly lets out a large amount of fire that nearly hits Luffy, Nami, and the other Water 7 citizens. Nami assumes that Franky has Devil Fruit powers and Franky suddenly leaps into the water much to the confusion of Luffy and Nami. Franky then suddenly crashes into the boat sending Luffy and Nami into the air and Franky says that he hasn't ate a Devil Fruit. As Luffy falls toward Franky, Franky launches his Strong Right move right at Luffy sending him flying across the water, into the wall, and downward right on the top of his head. Franky moves onto shore as the other people run away and Nami wonders if Franky doesn't have Devil Fruit powers, then what is he. Franky then takes off his hand saying he's actually a human with robotic parts, also known as a cyborg.\nBack at the Galley-La Company, Paulie is confused and shocked to hear that one of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Kalifa confirms this and says that she had Lucci contact the government for more information. Hattori then says that Robin is a notorious criminal and is no surprise that she will do something so sadistic. Kaku then says that the next thing to do is to find the Straw Hats and Lulu wonders if they did this because they wouldn't fix their ship. However, Kaku sums up that the Straw Hats are responsible and must be dealt with. At a different location, Sanji and Tony Tony Chopper are sailing on a boat still looking for Robin. Chopper is still worried about the large wave that will sink Water 7 underwater but Sanji remembers that Chopper left something behind on the Merry. Sanji then turns around much to the excitement of Chopper.\nAt the Galley-La Company, Tilestone charges into the room loudly excited to hear that Iceburg is awake (much to the disdain of the others due to Tilestone's loud yelling). Annoyed, Paulie knocks Tilestone out of the room telling him to keep it down as Iceburg needs the silence to recover. Tilestone then apologizes and then tells Paulie that Luffy and Franky are fighting and destroying the entire shipyard in the process. Paulie is clearly angered by this and Hattori says that at least they know where to find him. Paulie then leads the other members of the Galley-La out to confront Luffy and Kalifa informs Iceburg that now he has peace and quiet. At the shipyard, Luffy and Franky continue to brawl as they wreck the shipyard as they fight. Luffy launches his Gomu Gomu Pistol which sends Franky flying backwards and Franky retaliates with a giant blast (Weapons Left). Luffy dodges the attack and attempts to counter back with a kick but Franky blocks it. Suddenly, both Franky and Luffy are suddenly punched backwards and it was revealed to be by Galley-La. The people are excited to see them and Luffy is just as confused to why they attacked him. Franky warns Galley-La not to interfere with his fight with Luffy but Galley-La simply ignores him and Paulie questions Luffy. Paulie then uses Rope Action on Luffy and slams him onto the ground (Rope Action: Haafu-Notto Ea Doribu). Franky yells out in frustration about Galley-La attacking Luffy, but the other Galley-La members prepare for a fight. Lulu then fires shots at Luffy who absorbs it due to his Devil Fruit powers and Lulu then roughly kicks Luffy onto the ground. Franky then starts to fire at Galley-La and Kaku falls down from above. Franky attempts to blast him but Tilestone knocks him away with a giant log. Kaku then grabs Franky and slams him onto the ground. Meanwhile, Luffy is in a fist fight with Lucci who eventually knocks him backward with his hand. Luffy still doesn't understand why Galley-La is attacking him and Paulie says that one of the members of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Back in the hospital room, Iceburg is remembering that one of the attackers was indeed Nico Robin and wonders if the masked man is also with the Straw Hats. He also wonders that they are after something important and, outside, the people heard that the Straw Hats are to blame for the attempted murder and are said to capture the Straw Hat Pirates."

At the Colosseum, Jesus Burgess earns the ire of the audience when he indiscriminately attacks the audience while fighting the Fighting Fish. The Fighting Fish with the prize attacks Rebecca but misses, and Lucy gets on the fish. Diamante attacks Lucy but broke his sword against the latter's pipe. Jesus then attacks, but Lucy destroys his elbow guard, while Diamante notices the change in Lucy's fighting style.

          "Trebol notices a fly, and using his devil fruit powers, he shoots the fly with enough force to knock it through the wall of the officer tower. This scares all the dwarves, but Leo boasts that even if he can hit a fly, he will not be able to hit him, and runs towards the tower. As the other dwarves and Usopp cheer Leo on, Robin stops him.\nAt the Colosseum, as a fighting fish jumps towards him, rather than dodging them Burgess attacks them back with his Surge Elbow causing the fish to crash into one side of the Colosseum. The Colosseum workers order for stretchers for the audience who were injured by the fish and tell Burgess not to injure the audience but he simply laughs it off while the rest of the audience look on in shock. Then the Fighting fish with the Mera Mera no Mi on its back charges towards the contestants in the ring. As it rushes towards Rebecca, Sabo quickly tries to get a hold of the crate containing the Mera Mera no Mi. Diamante assuming that the person under the disguise of Lucy is Luffy and attacks him to prevent him from gaining possession of the crate containing the Mera Mera no Mi. However Sabo breaks Diamante's weapon with his pipe. Burgess attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and take down both of them at the same time. As Burgess takes his stance to prepare for his Surge Elbow, Sabo prepares to take the attack head-on with his Dragon Claw. He reinforces his attack with Armament Haki and clashes with Burgess. Much to everyone's surprise, Burgess's gauntlet shatters due to the force of the collision. Diamante however, realizes the difference between Luffy's and Sabo's fighting style and begins to doubt whether Lucy really is Luffy. Upon seeing the abilities of the other finalists, Rebecca begins to doubt her own strength, but after recalling the words of Thunder Soldier and Acilia she resolves to fight with killing intent, and charges at Diamante with her sword drawn.\nIn the lift, Thunder Soldier defeats the last of Doflamingo's underlings, but the dwarves are surprised to hear one other voice. Lao G reveals himself, them darts forward and beats the soldier into the wall with one blow. Kabu tries to come to the aid of his commander but is easily beaten by Lao G after the latter puts on his glasses to see his tiny assailant. As the dwarves express shock at the presence of an officer in the lift, Lao G explains that he intended to go to the Toy House, but ended up taking the lift down to the trade port instead. He affirms his stance as protecting the Toy House and refuses to let them in. However, Thunder Soldier suggests otherwise.\nThe scene moves to the Rampart Tower B-1, where Luffy is seen to have used Gomu Gomu no Fusen to protect Zoro and Viola after Pica smashed the walls together. After Zoro destroys the walls around them, Luffy and Zoro struggle against Pica to no avail.\nIn the Rampart Tower B-2, Kin'emon is knocked over, and gets up to see the walls and stairs around him are warped. Upon seeing that the stairs now lead upwards, Wicca expresses a sigh of relief, telling Kin'emon that they need to go up to reach the lift to the Toy House below, and berating him for refusing to listen up until now. When she remarks on the security in the palace, Kin'emon places a rock on his head and transforms into a grinning, evil figure.\nAt the Toy House, Marines go flying as a result of Franky's attack. Bastille grows impatient, and sends a flying slash at him. Dellinger arrives at the scene, to see Franky emerge unharmed and send a Coup de Vent back at the vice admiral. Senor Pink comments on the incompetence of the Marines, and Dellinger grows eager to fight, but Senor Pink tells him to be careful because of how perverted he is.\nBack with Luffy's group, Pica reforms his stone statue and blocks their path with a wall. Zoro destroys it and tells Luffy and Viola to move on, saying he will fight Pica alone."
