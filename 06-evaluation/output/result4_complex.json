        "long_summary": "Kuro attempts to use Shakushi on Luffy once again, but this time Luffy uses his rubber body to restrain him and prevent him from moving. Stretching his neck back, he uses Gomu Gomu no Kane, a powerful headbutt knocking Kuro unconscious and destroying his glasses. Concluding the battle, Luffy orders the remaining Black Cat Pirates to leave the island, taking Kuro with them.\nSimultaneously, Zoro and Usopp arrive to protect Kaya from Jango. Zoro cuts down a tree branch, clearing the way for Usopp's Hissatsu: Kayaku Boshi, a fired pellet that explodes in Jango's face, defeating him. As he did not want to be known as the village hero, Usopp asks the children not to disclose his deeds to the townspeople.\nAfter meeting with the crew to thank them for their help, Usopp meets with the children. Explaining his desires to leave the village to become a real pirate, Usopp disbands the crew, telling each child to pursue their individual ambitions.\nTo thank them for their heroic deeds, Kaya gifts the crew with the Going Merry, a full-sized caravel designed by Merry. Gratefully accepting the ship, the crew prepare to depart, also deciding to take Usopp along as a new permanent member of the crew.\nKaya meets with Merry at the coast, where Merry explains Usopp's past. In his childhood Usopp's father, Yasopp, set sail with Shanks to become a pirate, leaving behind his son and wife. Usopp's mother passed away from illness soon after Yasopp's departure. Now lonely, Usopp became the town liar, hoping that his lies would come true and his father would someday return.\nIn the present day, the children assume Usopp's role as the town liar, claiming an incoming pirate invasion.",

However, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e overhears this conversation and discovers that the other Straw Hats are alive. She reports this to Perospero, but to his horror, Big Mom decides to go to Nuts Island instead. Meanwhile, the Big Mom Pirates have invaded the Germa Kingdom.\nBack in the Mirro-World, Katakuri brings out his trident Mogura to attack Luffy. Luffy struggles to avoid its devastating attacks, and Katakuri continues to have the advantage as Luffy cannot hit him.",
        "long_summary": "Br\u00fbl\u00e9e finds another mirror leading to the Sunny, and Mascarpone and Joscarpone prepare to shoot flaming arrows into it. However, the Sunny crew quickly gets to work locating and breaking all the remaining mirrors on the ship, and the Big Mom Pirates are shocked as they shatter. Mascarpone and Joscarpone think that the Sunny sunk into the ocean which caused the mirrors to shatter, but Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is suspicious about it. Luffy notices the mirrors shattering, and catches Chopper on the other side of the mirror shard in his possession. Luffy runs away from Katakuri and the Big Mom Pirates to talk to them in secret, and Chopper reveals that Jinbe saved them from Big Mom's tidal wave. The crew wonders how Luffy will get back to them, and they make a plan for Luffy to reunite with them on Cacao Island, where they intend to reach in 10 hours at 1:00 AM. However, at that moment, Katakuri assaults Luffy, shattering the mirror shard. Luffy struggles to get away from Katakuri while holding the tiny remnants of the mirror, but is smashed into the ground by a giant mochi axe kick, and his crew is greatly concerned. However, Luffy tries acting like everything is fine and approves the plan to reunite on Cacao Island, causing his crewmates to celebrate.\nIn Sweet City, Count Niwatori asks Mont-d'Or about the status of the Straw Hats, worrying that they may have escaped from Totto Land. However, Mont-d'Or reassures him that the Territorial Sea Slugs will soon sense them, and they along with the Germa Kingdom will be overwhelmed. At the Germa Kingdom, the Big Mom Pirates have begun their assault. Yonji fights Charlotte Basskarte, and initially overpowers him as he easily deals with his flame shots. However, as Yonji charges at him, Basskarte uncovers his mouth and breathes a large stream of fire that consumes the former.\nAs Luffy struggles to get up, Katakuri brings his trident Mogura out of his arm and correctly predicts Luffy's declaration that he will not die here. He mocks this declaration, and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e pops out of a mirror to tell Luffy that he has no hope of beating Katakuri, saying that her brother is a superhuman who has never laid down since he was born. Luffy gets annoyed and tries to punch Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but Katakuri grabs his arm and throws him against the wall. Katakuri then transforms his arm into mochi and uses Mochi Tsuki to twist it around to strike at Luffy with Mogura. Luffy barely dodges the strike, and is awed at the damage left to the wall behind him before being forced to run away as the damage results in the entire section collapsing. As Luffy and Katakuri continue fighting, it turns out that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e had overheard Luffy talking to his crew and found out that they were still alive. She contacts Perospero to tell him about this and reveals the plan to meet on Cacao Island, and this relieves Perospero as he thinks Pudding's cake baking operation on Cacao Island will enable him to cover up his lie. He tells Big Mom to go to Cacao Island, but to his horror, she decides to head to the nearby Nuts Island instead. Back in the Mirro-World, Katakuri maintains his advantage against Luffy by overpowering him with Mogura, and Luffy continues to be unable to lay a hand on him. He tries using Thor Elephant Gun to punch Katakuri into the ground, but Katakuri transforms into mochi to avoid it and after transforming back, he punches Luffy into the air before attempting to strike him with Mochi Tsuki again.",

        "long_summary": "Usopp cries over the loss of Sanji, but Nami states that he was checking if his heart was beating on the right and he needed to check the left side. On doing that, Usopp became relieved that Sanji's heart was still beating. At that point, Usopp threatens Enel by lying that he has 8,000 followers and will spare Enel's life if he leaves. Enel, upset at Usopp, takes him out with his Goro Goro no Mi. Enel then told Gan Fall that the Divine Squad members, who he seized six years ago, have been working long and hard till this day without rest. He also told Gan Fall that his need for Sky Island is also complete. Enel stated that the people of Skypiea are ignorant in seeing the Upper Yard as only a land of Vearth. He stated that the Straw Hats, his crew and the Shandia all seek the City of Gold.\nAfter his discussion with Gan Fall, Enel left saying he is also a partaker in the final game and responded to Gan Fall's inquiry about his Divine Squad leaving Enel's forced labor as \"something only God knows\". At that moment, Hotori and Kotori, both of whom are brothers of Satori, appeared with the intention of avenging their brother's death. While still engaged in their battle, Luffy tells Wyper that cannons and rifles will not work on him. Wyper, seeing the statement as being true adds a Flavor Dial and his weapon becomes the Burn Bazooka. Luffy and Wyper battle for some time and eventually throw each other off after both launching a Bazooka-like attack on each other. Wyper thought it would be better not to kill Luffy and save his energy to kill Enel. Just as Luffy answers him, Luffy is swallowed by the Giant Python, leaving Wyper to wonder where Luffy had gone.\nGenbo and the Divine Soldiers battle and he easily overwhelms them. Yama then appears before Genbo. Genbo shoots an iron cannonball at Yama, which he dodges and kicks the iron cannonball back and damages Genbo. Genbo, refusing to be defeated, makes Yama launch the Ten-Fold Axe: Axe Mountain attack on Genbo and defeats him.\nWhile on the Going Merry, Nami and Gan Fall prepare for their battle with Kotori and Hotori. Luffy finds himself in an unidentifiable location. Chopper is still searching the ruins for the rest of the exploration crew where he comes in contact with Gedatsu.",

Bill reveals to Desire that he used everyone in his Silver Pirate Alliance to give him wealth so that he could live the most luxurious life in the world, and questions whether she really intends to defeat him and if she really believes she is stronger than him. Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill. The Silver Pirate Alliance members attack Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire as Bill prepares to kill them all with a bazooka. However, Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to knock out the pirates and their battle boats, leaving Bill alone and shocked. Luffy sees where Bill is, and Bill fires a cannonball at him, but Luffy shatters it as he punches Bill into the underground mine.\nBill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.\nBartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island. At the coast, the Silver Pirate Alliance and the Sweet Pirates get everyone onto a large ship as they prepare to escape the island's destruction. The Sweet Pirates worry about Desire, but are forced to set sail. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Barto Club are worried about Luffy and Bartolomeo, but Zoro is confident that they are all right since Luffy's vivre card is fine. Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.\nLater in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles. Inside Gran Tesoro, Tanaka arrives and reports to the Monster of the New World, a man named Gild Tesoro. Tanaka reports that Bill sank along with Silver Mine, but Tesoro is fine as he already had his fun with Bill and now was time for the real entertainment to start.",

Captain Hina uses her Devil Fruit abilities to also try and catch him, however Luffy escapes quickly and easily, much to the three's chagrin. Luffy battles more vice admirals as they gang up on him along with zombies Gecko Moria resurrects. Seeing Luffy in so much danger, Ace screams at Luffy not to come closer, as they have both lived their lives and adventures according to how they wanted to, so Luffy shouldn't get involved any longer. But, Luffy ignores all of this and continues fighting for Ace, because they are brothers. Annoyed by the turn of the war's tide, Sengoku reveals to all that Luffy is the son of the great Revolutionary Dragon and orders that he must be stopped at all costs. Thoroughly impressed, Whitebeard orders Marco that no harm should come to Luffy.",
        "long_summary": "While everybody is amazed at Luffy, both Koby and Helmeppo begin to talk about his selflessness. Luffy alerts Whitebeard about the plan to execute Ace ahead of schedule. Buggy comments that he hates Luffy's fearlessness and Ivankov claims that only Dragon's son could be so brave. Whitebeard thanks Luffy for the information and everybody is surprised they are talking in equal terms. Luffy begins his assault, breaking through all the Marines in his way. Jozu watches Luffy with joy, and sends his division to follow Luffy. Jinbe, Ivankov, and the Newkamas then leap into battle. The 14th division commanded by Speed Jiru also starts to charge. Garp is surprised that Luffy is in the battlefield as Sengoku speaks his thoughts about how the pirates can be encouraged by Luffy. Sengoku then commands the Marines through Den Den Mushi.\nWhitebeard is very cautious about Sengoku's plan, thinking over what they are planning. Marco alerts Whitebeard of the current situation about Ace and Squard who is tied with the vice admirals at the bay. Whitebeard warns Marco not to fall into Sengoku's trap as Sengoku is not a man who would make mistakes easily. The 14th division is assaulted by Kizaru who then sees Luffy close by, and decides to attack him. Ivankov saves Luffy by pushing him away with a Death Wink. Buggy and his followers begin to panic. When the Impel Down prisoners mistook Buggy's attitude as bravery, Galdino starts to scold them. Bartholomew Kuma then attacks Ivankov with his beams. After evading the beams, Ivankov is surprised about \"how he can attack him since they known each other for so long\". Ivankov tells Luffy to let him handle Kuma, and Luffy presses forward.\nFullbody and Jango prepare to attack Luffy, who does not remember them at first until he recalls their humiliation, which angers them, and by pure luck, he is able to avoid Jango's hypnotism by looking at a nearby explosion. Both Fullbody and Jango fell to Jango's hypnotism and are then kicked away by Hina, whom Luffy recognizes from Alabasta. Hina tries to imprison Luffy, but he manages to get past her using Gear Second. The Squard Pirates are having difficulties with the vice admirals, and Squard tries to sneak into the plaza to rescue Ace, but he sees a \"mysterious figure\" before proceeding. Luffy fights with several strong Marines, whom he is able to defeat with some difficulty. Gecko Moria commends Luffy's powers, and plans to once again take his shadow, this time for Oars Jr. and sends his army of zombies after him. Luffy tries to avoid conflict with Moria, but is soon stopped by an increasing number of zombies. Kizaru sends more Marines after him, wondering how long can Luffy last.\nAce shows his concern for Luffy and tells him to retreat, which surprises Boa Hancock and Marco. Ace starts to berate Luffy for getting into other's affairs. Luffy replies that they are brothers and he does not care about the code of pirates. Marines start to wonder if Luffy may be another son of Gol D. Roger. Luffy is then attacked by Moria's zombies, but they are subdued by Jinbe who uses seawater to defeat them. Jinbe tells Luffy that he will handle Moria. One of the giants attempts to crush Luffy as Sengoku tells everybody about Luffy's relationship with Ace as an adoptive brother and reveals that Luffy is the son of Dragon, which greatly shocks everybody. Smoker is now able to understand why Dragon saved Luffy at Loguetown.\nThis revelation greatly surprises the people at Sabaody Archipelago and prompts the Marines to kill Luffy. Garp does not mind since Luffy is already a well-known pirate. Luffy is able to defeat the giant with Gear Third, and shouts at Ace that he will save him \"even if it means death\" which prompts the Whitebeard Pirates to appreciate him due to their common goal, and Whitebeard tells Marco they \"cannot let him die\". Ace looks surprised at Luffy.",

        "long_summary": "The homies run away from Cracker and Luffy in order to avoid getting in their crossfire, but they are hit by Cracker's powerful aura and wither away. Luffy makes the first move as he activates Gear 2 and rushes at Cracker, but Cracker easily blocks Luffy's attacks with his sword and shield. Cracker then attacks, and to Luffy's shock he finds that Cracker has suddenly gained extra limbs and swords. Cracker attacks Luffy with three of his swords, sending him flying into a tree homie close to Nami and Pound. Cracker approaches the trio now with four arms each holding a sword, shocking Nami. He reveals that he can add extra limbs and weapons to his body by tapping it, adding even more arms and creating more swords and shields, as well as creating more legs. Luffy attacks Cracker again, only to be blown back by Cracker's increased defenses, and Nami tells Luffy not to engage in combat, as their goal is to retrieve Sanji as quickly as possible. However, Luffy states that he can only ever go all out in combat, and Cracker laughs at Luffy. He then boasts in his one-of-a-kind sword Pretzel, and Nami points out that he is holding six swords, which angers Cracker as he charges at the two Straw Hats. Luffy activates Gear 3 and clashes with Cracker, but still has no luck breaking through his defenses. Cracker overwhelms Luffy as he rapidly jabs at him with his multiple swords, and eventually catches Luffy in the chest with a spinning thrust called Roll Pretzel, which breaks through Luffy's Armament Haki defense and sends him flying a great distance through the Seducing Woods. Cracker pursues Luffy, causing massive amounts of destruction in his wake, and Nami chases after the two. However, she and Pound are confronted by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Kingbaum, who decide to take care of the two of them.\nNami steps back from the giant Kingbaum in fear, and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e mocks the Straw Hats and the other members of the Worst Generation, revealing that Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, Capone Bege, and Urouge had all previously invaded Totto Land. Except for Bege, who had allied himself to the Big Mom Pirates, all of the Supernovas had been chased away without seeing or even hearing Big Mom herself. The only one who made an impact in his invasion was Urouge, who managed to defeat one of the Sweet Commanders back when there were four of them. However, a massive storm hit as Big Mom sent a large fleet after Urouge, with Cracker in command. Urouge fought Cracker, and was unable to penetrate his defenses, even when he expanded his muscles with his Devil Fruit power. Cracker was underwhelmed by Urouge, and used Roll Pretzel to defeat him. Now, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e speculates that Urouge's body is lying around somewhere, and she creates a mirror before throwing it down by Nami's feet. She then disappears and reappears in the mirror, boasting in the power of the Four Emperors as she emerges and expands the mirror, grabbing Nami by the ankle. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e drags Nami into the Mirro-World, and Nami screams. Pound is initially overtaken with fear, but when Nami calls to him for help, he eventually builds up resolve and attacks Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. She dodges his punch, but releases Nami, and proclaims to her stepfather that he has made himself an enemy of Big Mom and her crew. However, Nami unleashes a weather egg to create a storm cloud and strike Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with lightning, stunning the woman as she falls into the Mirro-World and her mirror disappears. Pound states that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e will be back, and Nami apologizes for forcing his hand, but Pound sadly reflects that Big Mom already considers him an enemy due to authorizing Cracker to execute him. He then asks if Nami is friends with Lola, which she affirms, and Nami states that she now knows the Vivre Card Lola gave her points to Big Mom. As a result, it can also repel the homies, and Nami intends to use the card to its full extent.\nMeanwhile, Cracker catches up to Luffy, who is back up and intent on continuing the fight. Cracker attacks with Roll Pretzel again, but Luffy dodges the strike and barrages Cracker with Gear 2 kicks. Cracker maintains his defense, but is pushed back a bit; however, he proclaims that Luffy's attacks have no effect on him as he charges at Luffy. The nearby homies run in fear as the two clash, and Cracker tells Luffy to give up, but Luffy refuses as he is intent on seeing Sanji.",

On the Flower Field, Cavendish watches Luffy's new form in astonishment, but Law says that Luffy is overusing his Haki, confusing Cavendish. On the palace rooftop, Jesus Burgess searches for Luffy and sees him bouncing through the town. Koala, who hides behind a pile of rubble, remembers Burgess from the Corrida Colosseum and wonders what he wants with Luffy. Meanwhile, Viola, Hack, and Usopp have reached the Corrida Colosseum, and Viola contacts Riku Doldo III. Doldo asks if Doflamingo was the only one left standing, which Viola confirms.\nIn the streets below, Zoro runs toward the Birdcage when he is confronted by Kin'emon and Kanjuro. The samurai reveal that he is going in the wrong direction and tell him to get on Kanjuro's sparrow, which is struggling to carry the two samurai. Zoro gets on, causing the sparrow to strain extremely hard in order to start flying again. Meanwhile, the Birdcage reaches the SMILE Factory, and Franky sees this and tells the dwarves inside to evacuate the destroyed facility. As they exit the factory, they realize that the Birdcage is not cutting it up, which Franky realizes is because of it being made of Seastone. Zoro and the samurai then arrive, and Franky tells them that the center of town is the other way. However, Zoro reveals his intention to stop the Birdcage, leaving the dwarves in awe. As the three swordsmen fly away, Franky thinks about their plan and gets an idea.\nMeanwhile, Luffy hovers in midair and looks at Doflamingo, who is still lying on the ground and pondering Luffy's Gear 4 capabilities. Luffy decides to finish Doflamingo off now in order to avoid overusing Gear 4, and Doflamingo gets up and remarks that it must take a lot for Luffy to maintain that form. Luffy retracts both fists into his forearms to unleash a powerful attack, but Doflamingo suddenly blocks it by creating two waves of string from the ground. Luffy is shocked by Doflamingo's sudden move, and the Shichibukai reveals that his Devil Fruit has awakened, allowing him to turn his surroundings into string. Doflamingo turns more and more buildings into string and presses his attack on Luffy, who comments that this makes Doflamingo's fruit no longer look like a Paramecia, and is unable to overcome the constant barrages of string.\nThe citizens of Dressrosa continue running from the Birdcage, but those who are unable to run properly find the cage catching up to them, and a mother has lost her son. People are trapped under rubble, and medics continue wheeling people out of a hospital, begging the running citizens to help to no avail. One man decides to sit on the ground, giving up hope that they would be saved. Suddenly, Doldo broadcasts himself to the entire island. He reminds them that the shrinking Birdcage was not a dream, saying that they had been under a cage ever since Doflamingo had taken over ten years ago. However, every member of the Donquixote Pirates except Doflamingo himself had been taken down, and Luffy was currently fighting Doflamingo. Doldo tells the citizens that their nightmare would soon end, and urges them to keep running from the Birdcage no matter their condition, as there was still hope. This galvanizes the people, and the handicapped begin running again despite their ailments. Citizens, Marines, and pirates alike start helping free people from rubble and carting off the hospitalized people, knowing they would be saved as Luffy continues his battle with Doflamingo.",

Just as Oars is about to finish off Zoro, he increases his muscle mass and uses a Two Gorilla Slash to make the zombie get his hand stuck.

        "long_summary": "Luffy races through the abandoned Kurau City, looking for Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, Momonosuke, and Caesar Clown. He then enters the Whale Forest, and is awestruck at the giant tree shaped like a whale in the center. Luffy traverses through the trees, but he is unknowingly being watched by a mink named Pedro. Meanwhile, a canine mink named Wanda stops her fellow mink Carrot from attacking the Straw Hats, saying that they need to deal with an intruder in the Whale Forest. Usopp notices that Wanda is wearing Nami's clothes and becomes paranoid; Robin suggests that the minks could be cannibals, which only frightens Usopp more. Meanwhile, Luffy surveys the Whale Forest, but is suddenly confronted by two minks. Carrot then jumps a very high distance in order to survey the Whale Forest, shocking the Straw Hats with her abilities, and sees a disturbance occurring there. She comes back down and climbs on Wanda's steed Wany, and Wanda gives the Straw Hats directions to get to the Rightflank Forest, where they will find the corpse of their crewmate, which appalls them. Wanda and Carrot ride toward the Whale Forest, with Wanda revealing that the pirates they just met are the Straw Hat Pirates, and that Luffy is probably the intruder in the Whale Forest. However, the Guardians may not show him mercy despite who he is.\nMeanwhile, Usopp freaks out about the minks and what happened to their crewmates, and Robin only continues assuming the worst about the minks. However, Zoro and Franky are confident that their crewmates are safe, and Robin asks Law if his crewmates are here as well. Law affirms this, though he did not plan a way to get back to them because he thought he would never seen again, but he realizes he has Bepo's Vivre Card in his possession. Law reveals to the Straw Hats that Bepo is a mink, but left Zou at a young age, and the pirates follow the direction the Vivre Card is pointing toward.\nIn the Whale Forest, Luffy clashes with a bull mink named Roddy; the two butt heads while Roddy discharges electrical energy. Luffy and Roddy fight evenly, with both parties managing to repel the other. The other Guardian, a gorilla mink named Blackback, wonders how Roddy's Electro does not work on Luffy, who reveals to them that he is made of rubber. Luffy and Roddy continue fighting, when suddenly Bepo, Jean Bart, Shachi, and Penguin arrive at the scene. They recognize Luffy and tell Roddy to stop attacking, as Luffy is a friend, but Roddy refuses. Jean Bart tries to break the two up by force, but an angry Blackback flips him over. An enraged Roddy mounts another charge, but Wanda and Carrot then arrive, throwing a fluttering object to distract Roddy and bananas to pacify Blackback. Luffy asks Wanda why they were attacking him, and Wanda reveals that the Guardians are tasked with keeping intruders out of the Whale Forest. Wanda then talks to Pedro, who is standing on a treetop, apologizing for Luffy's intrusion and telling him to call back the Guardians. Pedro does so, and the large number of Guardians that had secretly surrounded Luffy all disperse; Luffy is bewildered due to not knowing they were there, and Wanda tells him to be glad this was not a moonlit night. Luffy then meets the Heart Pirates, who are initially confused by him referring to Law as \"Torao\", but are happy to find out their captain is here.\nMeanwhile, the Straw Hats and Law travel through Kurau City, noticing the massive damage and the lack of anyone here. Robin, Zoro, and Law inspect various buildings as Usopp continues panicking, and the Straw Hats see large claw marks on the buildings, big footprints on the ground, and torture devices with blood on them. Robin then reveals that whatever happened to cause this damage was only a week or two ago, meaning Sanji and the others were likely involved in it. Meanwhile, Wanda reveals to Luffy that the country was destroyed by Jack as Wanda and Carrot emotionally remember the bloodshed that occurred not too long ago. Suddenly, the ground begins shaking, and the minks prepare for the upcoming Eruption Rain. Wanda tells Luffy to get onto Wany and she will take him to his friends, and Luffy is excited to see Sanji and the others. However, Wanda fails to affirm his statement, and Luffy wonders what is wrong.",

Luffy begs him to stop before he kills himself, prompting Bellamy to reprimand him for still saying this. As Luffy points out how his body has reached its limit, Bellamy punches him in the face with his Armament Haki-coated fist, sending Luffy rolling back, before continuing to bounce around the room while declaring that he will decide where he dies himself. Reminding Luffy that he intends to become the Pirate King, Bellamy braces himself on the ceiling and proclaims that Luffy should not let himself be held up by these sorts of situations before smashing into him and punching his torso, causing Luffy to cough up blood.\nMeanwhile, on Flower Hill, Kyros stares down Pica before falling to his knee, prompting Rebecca to express concern. Kyros notes that it was obvious from the start that the fight would never end as long as another opponent remained before telling Rebecca to fall back because he must put this country back in the hands of Riku Doldo III. Hearing this, Pica asks him and Rebecca what Riku is to them before reminding Rebecca that she has been cursed at and Kyros that he had lost his leg and become a toy because of him. However, Rebecca counters with the fact that the Donquixote Pirates framed him as Kyros declares that he owes Riku a lot for taking him in as a young boy before proclaiming that the people of Dressrosa were happy while the peace-understanding Riku family ruled even though they were not as prosperous. Claiming that Riku taught them simply living was happiness, Kyros tells Pica that the whole country wants him on the throne and the Donquixote Pirates kicked out.\nPica merely states that he understands before disappearing, prompting Nico Robin to wonder what is going on. As the ground begins rumbling, Pica uses Charlestone, causing another spike to emerge from the hillside as a shocked Bartolomeo wonders what just happened. Robin realizes that Pica just went to the third level as more spikes emerge, prompting Roronoa Zoro to curse Pica while demanding to know if he wants to fight or not before promising to cut him down once Pica enters his range. However, upon seeing Pica attacking several Donquixote Family underlings and an unconscious Hajrudin, Zoro realizes he is attacking the injured as Sai tells Baby 5 to watch out. When Baby 5 tries to hold onto his arm, Sai reprimands her for getting too close, prompting Baby 5 to tell him to not be so shy since they will be husband and wife. Appearing behind Baby 5, Pica declares that she has betrayed them before using Ishiusu on her, prompting Sai to push her out of the way before being hit by the two spiked sphere halves himself.\nAs Baby 5 and Chinjao call out to him, Sai manages to push the two sphere halves apart while coating most of his body in Armament Haki, prompting Chinjao to offer to help him get out. However, a panicked Sai tells him to look out as Pica uses Charlestone on all of them, along with Ideo. Managing to dodge the stone spikes, Sai lands on the ground before cursing Pica as Zoro runs toward them. Unsheathing one of his swords, Zoro demands to know how Pica could attack the injured, only for Pica to attack him with Bitestone, which he counters using Baki. With one half of his stone face rising into the air, Pica asks Zoro if he knows who is on the King's Plateau, prompting Zoro to cut him in half once more while declaring that the king of Dressrosa is there. Rising behind Zoro, Pica reminds him that Riku is the former king, only to be cut in half once more as Zoro demands to know what his point is. Pica forms another face while claiming that it is unfair for only Donquixote Doflamingo to take the blame for Dressrosa's invasion even though such things happen all the time.\nDriving Zoro back with more spikes, Pica notes that the samurai and Usopp are on the plateau alongside the former officials of Dressrosa and that the whole country seeks Riku's restoration. When Zoro asks him why this matters, Pica declares that it angers him because Doflamingo is the only king before suddenly going silent. After a few seconds, the ground begins rumbling once more as the giant stone statue of Pica begins shaking. As the other combatants wonder what is going on, the statue detaches itself from the mountain and reforms its missing parts as the citizens below flee in terror. Now in control of the statue, Pica declares that Dressrosa is Donquixote's country before beginning to walk forward. As Usopp wonders what he is planning, Zoro runs toward Pica and slashes through several stone obstacles while wondering if Pica plans on killing Riku.\nWhile the terrified citizens below attempt to outrun him, Pica takes a step forward, flattening the land beneath him while creating a shockwave that sends the nearby buildings and Marines flying. As the Marines open fire on Pica to no avail before being sent flying by another step, Zoro continues to run toward Pica while noting that Pica drove him out this far so that he could not catch up to him. noting that he has to do something soon because it will only take Pica one punch to flatten the plateau and kill Usopp and Riku in an instant. Several underlings fire on Zoro in an attempt to prevent him from interfering with Pica, but Zoro simply cuts them down before moving on. Seeing the spikes below her being destroyed, Robin realizes Zoro is on the move as Kyros notes there is no way to stop Pica's giant body.\nAs he runs, Zoro begins thinking of plans to take Pica down. His first plan is a long-distance slash, but Zoro notes that it would travel too far and thus be too weak. His second plan is jumping on top of Pica, but Zoro quickly realizes that it would be impossible to jump so high. His third plan is to warn Usopp and the others, but Zoro notes that they would not hear him from this distance. His fourth plan is to call Usopp on the Den Den Mushi and tell him to run, but Zoro finds that he does not have it with him after reaching into his jacket. As Pica continues moving toward the plateau, Zoro notes that there is not enough time for Usopp and the others to flee anyway as several cheering underlings are knocked out by Pica's footsteps. Baby 5 notes that Pica plans to kill Riku, prompting Sai to admit that he does not like it even though it is none of his business as Orlumbus wonders what they should do.\nWhile Bartolomeo challenges Pica to fight him instead of attacking Usopp, Usopp and the samurai scream in terror as Elizabello II notes that he is glad that he saved his King Punch as Zoro instructed him. As Elizabello promises to use it to save his friend Riku, Zoro tells him to wait before reminding those present that it is useless to just destroy Pica's stone body and that they need to defeat his real body. Elizabello demands to know what they should do instead as Pica reaches the plateau, prompting Orlumbus to note that they are out of time. However, as Pica cracks his knuckles, Zoro looks at Orlumbus and grins before tying on his bandanna while asking Elizabello to give him two minutes. While Pica demands to know if Riku is on the plateau, Zoro declares that his fifth plan is flying into the sky and cutting up Pica.",

        "long_summary": "As some of the Donquixote Pirates' underlings exclaim that Lao G has been defeated, Roronoa Zoro looks over the enormous rift in the ground created by Sai's Kiryu Kirikugi and notes how destructive it was before deciding to keep Sai and his fleet in mind due to how powerful they are. Meanwhile, Sai runs up to the battered Chinjao and begs him to not die as Baby 5 states that she will make preparations for two ceremonies, a wedding and a funeral, which prompts both Sai and Chinjao to angrily proclaim that the latter is not dead yet.\nAbove them, Zoro dodges another one of Pica's stone spikes as Pica laughs at him. When an irritated Zoro tells him to stop laughing because it is annoying, Pica becomes angered and demands to know what is wrong with laughing while having fun before using Charlestone once more, which sends several of his subordinates flying. Managing to dodge the spikes, Zoro runs along one of them while demanding to know who Pica is targeting before leaping forward and cutting Pica's stone face to pieces, only for Pica to escape seconds before the stone is cut. After cutting another spike in half, Zoro states that he detests how Pica keeps doing the same thing over and over again before noticing Elizabello II standing next to him. Offering to assist Zoro, Elizabello states that Riku Doldo III is an old friend of his before asking Zoro if he has figured out Pica's ability yet and explaining how he can only use his King Punch once per hour. When Zoro confirms that he has, Elizabello proclaims that he will take Pica down, but Zoro states that he will be the one to do so before telling Elizabello to save his King Punch because they do not know what is to come. Another stone spike juts out from the mountainside, forcing Zoro and Elizabello to separate as the latter agrees to save his King Punch. As Pica forms another stone face, Zoro wonders what he is up to.\nMeanwhile, on Flower Hill, the ground flaps up and down like a flag, causing Kyros to lose his balance and be forced to lean on his sword for support as Diamante tells him to grovel in the dirt. Realizing that it is all connected, Diamante states that the toy soldier who was crying and screaming when he killed Scarlet was actually Kyros. When Diamante notes that there is nothing but hatred between them, Kyros agrees and leaps into the air before proclaiming that this is why he came here as he attacks Diamante, who blocks Kyros's sword with his steel cape before attacking Rebecca with Vipera Glaive. However, Kyros manages to reach Rebecca in time and blocks the attack, prompting Diamante to run toward him and seemingly attack him with Vipera Glaive, only to redirect the attack toward Rebecca at the last second. After Kyros blocks this attack as well, Rebecca realizes that Diamante is targeting her and tells Kyros she will fight as well, prompting Diamante to proclaim he will kill her as well before attacking her once more. As Kyros protects Rebecca again, Diamante states that he wants to see him lose both his wife and daughter as Kyros tells Rebecca he will fight because he wants to avenge Scarlett and compensate for teaching her how to fight before proclaiming that he will no longer let his daughter swing his sword now that he is human once more.\nElsewhere in Dressrosa, a mother and her daughter sit in a burning building as parts of the flaming ceiling fall down around them. However, they are saved by the arrival of Sabo, who extinguishes the flames before telling them that they are going to be fine. After getting the mother and daughter outside, Sabo offers them cups of water before hearing a soldier shouting that his friends are stuck in a cage at the Corrida Colosseum. When Sabo tells him to take him there, the soldier agrees and runs off, leaving Sabo to look up at the palace where Monkey D. Luffy is fighting before running after him.\nIn the palace, Bellamy bounces around the room with his Spring Hopper technique and proclaims that he and his technique have grown stronger just like Luffy has. As some of Bellamy's blood splashes on his face, Luffy tells him to stop before he dies, but Bellamy reprimands him for worrying about his enemy before admitting that he is aware of how he looked up to the wrong man and how foolish he is. Recalling how Luffy tried to get Donquixote Doflamingo to let him go, Bellamy declares that it would be disgraceful for him to turn his back on the man he admired simply because he did not get the response he desired. Proclaiming that even fools like him have principles to stick to, Bellamy tells Luffy that this will be his last fight and that Luffy must join him. When Luffy tells him to stop and claims that he has no reason to accept such a fight, Bellamy recalls their first meeting in Mock Town and how Luffy was the same way back then before telling Luffy to stand right there if he believes Bellamy's determination is cheap. Leaping off a wall toward Luffy, Bellamy hardens his right arm with Armament Haki before driving it into Luffy's Armament Haki-hardened abdomen.\nAbove them, Doflamingo and Trebol walk toward Trafalgar D. Water Law, who is limping away while clutching the stump where his right arm used to be. Kneeling down, Law picks up Kikoku before realizing Doflamingo is standing next to him as Doflamingo kicks him away. Walking over to Law, Doflamingo stomps on his wrist and asks him how long he will keep up his game of revenge as Trebol calls him pathetic. Doflamingo wonders if Law wishes to lose another arm and decides to torment him instead of killing him right away before punching and kicking Law several times in succession. When Doflamingo kicks Law away, Trebol grabs him with a thread of mucus before slamming him into the ground. Getting to his feet, Law claims that he has been willing to give up his arms from the start before running toward Doflamingo and Trebol, who states that Law must be really stupid. Law slashes at Doflamingo, who leaps into the air before cutting Law's chest with Goshikito. However, when Doflamingo lands, Law stomps on his foot and creates a ROOM before hitting Doflamingo with Counter Shock, which creates an explosion. As the smoke clears, a panting Doflamingo grabs Law and thanks him for the attack before throwing him away and piercing his body with Fullbright, which causes Law to cough up blood. As Law falls to the ground, Doflamingo looks at his jacket and promises to send him to meet Corazon.\nMeanwhile, Luffy is sent crashing into a wall by Bellamy's attack and falls to his knees before telling Bellamy to stop once more. As Doflamingo reaches for his pistol upon realizing Luffy has not come up yet, Bellamy punches Luffy into the ground once more while Law grins at Doflamingo, only to be hoisted by the hood of his jacket by Trebol, who asks him how he can be so relaxed in this situation. When Luffy tells him to stop once more, Bellamy points out how he has been fired from the Donquixote Pirates, and when Luffy says this is good because Doflamingo betrayed him, Bellamy asks him if this means he should side with Luffy. After reiterating that he cannot abandon his principles like this, Bellamy crashes into Luffy once more as Trebol hits Law with Beta Launcher, causing several explosions. As flames engulf the surrounding area, Doflamingo and Trebol stand over Law, whom Trebol tells to give up as Doflamingo says he should rest.\nElsewhere, on the third level of the plateau, Gladius kneels and touches the ground as Cavendish cuts down one of his subordinates before telling him to stand up. When Cavendish claims he is very close to victory, Gladius tells him to not push his luck as the ground begins swelling up around him in domes. Realizing that Gladius has been setting these up, Cavendish runs over to Bartolomeo, who is standing behind a barrier, and tells him to let him inside, but Bartolomeo refuses because it will put himself and Nico Robin in danger. As Gladius tells his subordinates they will be fine because they are elites, Cavendish angrily demands that Bartolomeo open the barrier as Gladius uses Punc Rock Fest, causing the domes to explode while Gladius bids Cavendish farewell.",

        "long_summary": "On Flower Hill, Nico Robin deactivates her Kochoran as an irritated Diamante curses her. When Robin asks him if he does not think Rebecca and Kyros are disadvantaged, Diamante points out that this is not some sort of competition and that he is here to execute them. However, Robin claims that he has this backwards before telling Kyros that he does not need to hold back any longer because she will protect Rebecca. Thanking her, Kyros states that he could not contain his rage for much longer.\nMeanwhile, on the third level, Bartolomeo notices two Donquixote Pirates underlings carrying Gladius away on a stretcher and demands to know what they are doing, prompting them to beg him for forgiveness while explaining that they are carrying away the corpse of a defeated man. When Bartolomeo points out how Gladius is not dead yet, the underlings proclaim that they want to treat him even if it takes a few days for him to regain consciousness. As the underlings beg him to show mercy, Bartolomeo angrily tells them to get going already, prompting them to run away with Gladius while noting that Bartolomeo will pay for pushing his luck like this.\nOn the first floor of the royal palace, two more underlings carry Dellinger to a large door, only to trip and send his unconscious body sprawling on the ground as three more underlings berate them. However, they are interrupted by Giolla, who demands to know how they could treat a member of the Donquixote Family like this. Apologizing profusely, the two underlings accidentally throw Dellinger behind them onto the floor, prompting Giolla to refuse to forgive them before turning them into art, which she calls \"Penance\". After ordering the other underlings to put Penance somewhere in the palace where others can see it, Giolla expresses disbelief at how the executives are being defeated one after another before being informed by another underling that Gladius will be carried in soon. Surprised by this news, Giolla notes that she must get things started as soon as possible before ordering the underling to bring \"it\" to her as someone cries in a cell.\nElsewhere, Viola, having seen all of this, wonders what Giolla plans to do before noticing that the Den Den Mushi in her hand is ringing and realizing that it is coming from the SMILE Factory. At the factory, Senor Pink spins around while upside down in the concrete as Kyuin and three other girls look on with admiration. When Franky throws a punch at him, Senor Pink traps his arm with his legs before flipping him on his back as the dwarves contact Viola with a Den Den Mushi. Wicca informs Viola that they are the team at the factory as Inhel asks her what is happening with Mansherry and Leo's group. As a tearful Maujii hopes that Mansherry is not having a hard time, Viola reveals that things just became worse, prompting Wicca to ask if something happened to Mansherry. Telling the group that she will call Leo now, Viola contacts Leo, who informs her that he and Kabu are approaching the Rampart Tower as they speak. As Kabu states that they will reach the chapel soon, Viola informs them that they need to move quickly because Giolla is forcing Mansherry to use her ability. Leo is shocked by this as Wicca tells him to hurry up.\nAt the Rampart Tower, several underlings see Leo and Kabu approaching and begin firing at them, though Leo and Kabu easily dodge the bullets. Seeing this, one of the underlings decides to blow them and the staircase up with a bomb, but Leo and Kabu kick him and his ally into the ground before dispatching the rest of their attackers. Promising to get there as fast as they can, Leo asks Mansherry to hold on for a bit longer. Meanwhile, Giolla tells Mansherry to do as she says already, only for Mansherry to claim that she cannot do it anymore before asking Giolla to let her go back to Green Bit. However, Giolla demands to know whom Mansherry called Boa Hancock, prompting Mansherry to point out that she did not say anything like this. Giolla tells Mansherry that it is time to use her ability and points out the defeated Lao G, Dellinger, Sugar, and Machvise behind her before noting that those who defeated them are also badly injured. Proclaiming that Mansherry reviving the fallen executives with her Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers means certain death for their enemies, Giolla notes that there will be a drastic shift in the tides of battle before ordering Mansherry to revive the executives with the watering can filled with healing water that she used to heal Sugar.\nAs Giolla pokes her face and the underlings behind her laugh, Mansherry reveals that she knows of how the Donquixote Pirates are enemies of Riku Doldo III and how Donquixote Doflamingo has been lying to the Tontatta Tribe. When Giolla demands to know why this is important, Mansherry declares that she does not want to heal bad people anymore, which makes Giolla tear up at how cute she finds Mansherry to be. However, when the underlings declare that Mansherry is cute as well, Giolla berates them for being fooled and shoves them aside before demanding to know whom Mansherry called a once-in-a-millennium beauty. Giolla advances toward Mansherry, who denies saying anything like this while mentally begging Leo to help her. Picking up Mansherry, Giolla asks her if she cares whether or not her friends at the SMILE factory remain safe, only for Mansherry to point out that the executives will hurt people if she heals them. Giolla grasps Mansherry's head before proclaiming that she will squeeze her power out no matter what it takes, prompting Mansherry to cry out to Leo for help once more.\nElsewhere, Leo and Kabu rush down a hallway as an underling fires a cannonball at them. Though Leo dodges, Kabu is hit, prompting Inhel to wonder what happened to him. Telling Leo to go on, Kabu promises to catch up with him later and claims that he is alright, which Leo grudgingly agrees to do. The underling attempts to shoot Leo as well, but Leo jumps in the air and dodges the cannonball, which hits the ceiling and buries the underling and his companion in rubble as Leo rushes out. Meanwhile, Giolla continues to hurt Mansherry while demanding that she take out the watering can, only for Mansherry to claim that Giolla is hurting her as a tear falls from her eye. The tear lands on an injured underling beneath Mansherry and heals him, to the surprise and delight of Giolla, who is informed by another underling that Mansherry's tear fell on him.\nWalking over to the unconscious executives, Giolla notes that Mansherry's tears can heal as well before ordering her to cry while hitting her dozens of times in rapid succession. Seeing this, Viola frantically tells Leo to hurry, prompting Leo to confirm that he will do so before charging through more underlings. When Riku asks her what is wrong, Viola reveals that Giolla has discovered the healing properties of Mansherry's tears and is beating her in order to make her cry, causing the dwarves to tear up as Maujii attempts to go save Mansherry, only to be held back by Bomba, Bobomba, and Baxcon as Bomba tells him that they have to rely on Leo and Kabu for now. At the plateau, Usopp expresses surprise at Mansherry being able to heal others, prompting Viola to explain that she ate the Chiyu Chiyu no Mi, which allows her to heal. As Usopp notes that this must be why the enemy wants her, Kin'emon and Kanjuro confirm this as Viola reveals that Giolla is trying to use this power to revive the fallen executives.\nInhel declares that there will be a crisis if she succeeds as a shocked Usopp notes that the executives will keep coming back no matter how many times they are beaten. As Kin'emon states that there will be no end, the dwarves encourage Leo and Kabu to keep going while Usopp asks Viola if Sugar is among the executives whom Giolla has gathered, prompting him and the dwarves to express shock when Viola reveals that she is. The dwarves and Usopp recall their experiences with Sugar as Usopp declares that their efforts will be meaningless if the executives come back. As Usopp and the dwarves cheer him on, Leo blasts through the remaining underlings in the hall before arriving in the room with Giolla, Mansherry, and the executives. However, Giolla claims that Leo is too late as the underlings in the room advance on him. Though Leo quickly defeats the underlings, Giolla manages to get Mansherry crying and begins sprinkling her tears on the executives while declaring that the second round begins now. Suddenly, Kabu rushes into the room and tells Leo to deal with Giolla before knocking the executives out of the way of the falling tears with Beetle Upper.\nLeaping between the executives and the defeated underlings, Leo attaches them to his needle with thread as Giolla declares that she will simply line up the executives and try again. However, Leo threads his needle throughout her dress and promises to make sure she and the others are never separated again before defeating Giolla with Haute Couture: Patch Work by pulling on the thread, causing those whom he caught before to slam into Giolla, knocking her unconscious. As she falls, Giolla lets go of Mansherry, who happily notes that Leo came to save her like a prince as Leo catches her in his arms. Meanwhile, having seen this, Viola declares to the others that Leo made it, prompting them to yell in excitement and commend Leo for a job well done. Grabbing Leo's suspender, Mansherry tells him that she was scared, only for Leo to inform her that she has gained some weight, which prompts Mansherry to punch him as Kabu notes that it is the same as ever.\nAt the royal palace, Bellamy continues to bounce around the room with Spring Hopper while hitting Monkey D. Luffy repeatedly. After being smashed into a wall, Luffy tells Bellamy that he really will die if he keeps going because his body is injured, only for Bellamy to hit him once more while noting that he is still worrying about his enemy despite taking so many blows. When Bellamy claims that Luffy must have also gone through an event that shattered his confidence, Luffy glares at him, prompting Bellamy to hit him from behind while proclaiming that he might be able to remain in Doflamingo's memory for a little longer if he manages to take down Luffy before dying. Bellamy punches Luffy, who coughs up blood, before continuing to bounce around the room as Luffy looks at him with a determined look on his face.",

        "long_summary": "The Straw Hats are deceived by Foxy, who uses his Noro-Noro Beam to trap them in place and drop them into a deep pit on the deck of the Sexy Foxy. Luffy busts through one of the pit's walls, and the Straw Hats are confronted with Foxy, who has taken up an obvious disguise that Luffy nonetheless fails to see through. Eventually Sanji sets him on the right track, and Foxy makes a getaway covered by his powers. Luffy, Nami and Usopp chase after him, while Sanji and Zoro are frozen in a compromising position.\nNami and Usopp find a door with a message that only men can enter. When they both go in, they find that it is a passage over the Sexy Foxy's brig, filled with the Foxy Pirates' troublemakers that have not seen a woman in a long time. Nami finds it too uncomfortable to cross, so Usopp reasons that the prisoners will be vulnerable to light after their time in the dark brig, and throws a flash-bang. Nami is able to make it through, although Usopp trips and falls, and the prisoners hold him in place.\nLuffy and Nami arrive in a large atrium, where Foxy, Porche and Hamburg attack them with the Gorilla Puncher 13 and Donkey Kicker 18. Inspired by Luffy calling for water after he burns his hand on the machine's fist, Nami uses Thunderstorm Tempo to put out the fires, allowing Luffy to smash the Gorilla Puncher and use Gomu Gomu no Spinning Top to collide it with the other machine and defeat them both. Afterward, the Straw Hats and Foxy convene on the deck and agree to end hostilities. Foxy then tearfully asks his crew if they will still accept him, which they enthusiastically confirm. However, as the Straw Hats return to their own ship, Foxy privately tells his subordinates that they must defeat Luffy or they will be stuck flying his ridiculous flag forever.\nThe Straw Hats disembark on an island, where Sanji starts a barbeque. Foxy, Porche, and Hamburg attack in a large crab-shaped submarine which they are confident will be mistaken for an ordinary crab, and their prediction comes true as Luffy grabs the sub's leg and tries to bring it to the barbeque. When its pilots try to shake him off, Luffy angrily retaliates and slams the submarine into the beach, causing it to explode. Porche calls a backup ship and the three return to the Sexy Foxy.\nThe Straw Hats decide to venture into the island's jungle to search for medicinal herbs. They are confused by what looks like a bicycle track along the jungle path. Eventually, they come to a clearing with what looks to be a mushroom growing from a rock. Chopper goes to investigate and is struck out from behind the rock. When the others follow, they see that Chopper actually disturbed the sleep of a mysterious man, the sight of whom sends Robin into a panic. She explains that the man is one of the strongest individuals enlisted in the Marines: the Admiral Aokiji. He responds by saying that she's grown into a beautiful woman, seeming to recognize her.",

Buggy fakes a crybaby fit then takes a guard by surprise with Chop-Chop Quick Escape and knocks the guard down with Aerial Topspin Big Top. The guard gets back up but is then knocked down again by Luffy. This leaves the clown pirate is shock. Buggy explains the Blugoris or Blue Gorillas are very tough fighters, but Luffy already had beaten them.\nA guard is informed that one of the escapees is with Luffy and have beaten the Blugoris.\nBuggy is surprised that Luffy has arrived to save Ace and refuses an offer to get free from the prisoners. The clown also thinks back to when he and his crew met Ace when a feast was crashed. Having become friends, Buggy worries that the capture of Ace will incur the wrath of Whitebeard and rejects helping Luffy get into Level 5. Luffy also reminds that 10 battleships are on point, guarding the jail's docks.\nAs Buggy formulates a plan, he spots the armband that Nami gave Luffy and tries to pry. More guards arrive, forcing them to leave. The clown hopes if he gets the armband, they'll find Ace for sure. Buggy flies through leaving his feet in Luffy's hands.\nIn a flashback, Buggy had walked through a cave supposedly containing Captain John's treasure. The clown warns what dangers will await. Just then, a group of workers spotted Buggy's party thinking they were recruits. As he dug through the cave, Buggy was frustrated. As Buggy's crew searched for the treasure, he was spotted by a group of marines at a navy base. They threw him in Impel Down and he thought it was destiny.\nBuggy explains they need to go through the levels by number, first Level 1 to 2. He also says he was tortured in Level 4 a few times before. Below Level 5, a group of criminals are wiped from history. When Luffy thinks about the treasure map, he presents the armband mistaking it for the map to Captain John's treasure. Buggy takes the band thanking Luffy.\nJust then, Buggy crashes into a wall, with Luffy convinced it will contain a shortcut.\nMeanwhile, Hancock and Hannyabal's party continue their descent with the former getting more worried for Luffy. Hancock steps on the vice-warden for interrupting her romantic moment.\nLuffy and Buggy break through a wall into the guard room. They soon find themselves in a red spiky forest. Buggy explains the trees are Blade Trees and the grass is Spike Needle Grass to cut the feet. Venomous spiders chase the prisoners to further torture the prisoners. Luffy is shocked at this discovery about the Crimson Hell. Luffy throws Buggy's feet to the ground and it should protect him for a while.\nBuggy flies along the bladed grass hopes to find an exit. Eventually, the two find a deep hole and it's a one way drop to Level 2. Luffy decides to jump anyway while Buggy flees with the armband thinking he'll finally get the treasure he's aimed for. Then, a Blugoris aims an axe, sending Buggy's main body down the hole and soon, Buggy's head follows.\nElsewhere, a large wild beast roars while some of the prisoners complain about its hunger. Galdino despairs knowing he would be eaten soon. Luffy and Buggy continue their descent.",

        "short_summary": "As Luffy continues to fight Kaidou, Kaidou uses a form of drunk fighting known as Shuron Hakke which makes the battle harder for Luffy. Meanwhile at Mary Geoise, as the Five Elders review the situation, they mention a Devil Fruit that had not awakened for centuries to which the World Government had to rename, just as Zunesha arrives at Wano Country.",
        "long_summary": "While the battle between Kaidou and Luffy is taking place at the rooftop of the Skull Dome, Momonosuke is desperate to steer Onigashima away from the Flower Capital where its citizens are oblivious to the catastrophe that could befall them. In the Flower Capital, the people are drinking their fill and dancing to the music. They send lanterns to the sky, with their wishes written on them so that they may reach heaven. In hers, Toko writes that she wants to see her adoptive father again, which breaks Hitetsu\u2019s heart.\nBack at the rooftop, Kaidou looks at the beautiful night sky and takes out a barrel full of sake and takes huge gulps of the alcohol. Luffy is angry that he is drinking while they are fighting. Kaidou tells him that it is because he is having fun. Today is the Fire Festival and they had planned a banquet on Onigashima, but Luffy and the others messed it all up. He offers some booze to Luffy, but the latter refuses and declares, instead that he\u2019ll have a banquet of his own after he beats Kaidou.\nKaidou releases a huge amount of Haki and tells Luffy that he hopes he can have a nice big banquet. Luffy is angered once more, seeing that Kaidou is now drunk. Indignant at the accusation, Kaidou throws the barrel of sake down and then weeps at his ruined banquet. He proceeds to hiccup and laugh while staggering around, barely able to keep standing upright. Incensed at the sight of a drunk Kaidou, Luffy charges at him. However, Kaidou easily evades him and attacks using his Lightning Hammered: Ragnaraku technique. Luffy receives a direct hit, and a shockwave is felt throughout the rooftop.\nNow in his dragon form, a drunk, weeping Kaidou laments that even though he is having fun, the battle has already destroyed half of his castle which took five years to build. Kaidou continues to wail about his woes while attacking Luffy using his drunken techniques. Luffy continues to retaliate and finally lands a kick to his stomach which causes Kaidou to cough up blood.\nMeanwhile, in Mary Geoise, the Five Elders complain how this year\u2019s Levely is cursed. They mention that it resulted in the total abolition of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, an incident concerning the Arabasta Kingdom, and the Revolutionary Army\u2019s infiltration of Mary Geoise. The blond elder says that they need to set those aside for now and immediately deal with what is happening in the Land of Wano. He is expectant that the CP0 have captured Nico Robin by now, and that the battles involving Big Mom and Kaidou will result to death. He mentions of the need to erase the existence of a certain Devil Fruit. Another elder rebuffs its existence, saying that the said fruit is a mere legend even to them as it has not awakened for centuries. However, the blond elder says that the World Government would not have bothered giving that Devil Fruit another name if they did not want to hide its name from history.\nAt the seas just outside of Wano, a fleet of Marine Ships are on standby awaiting orders. A scout sees a giant shadow and uses a Den Den Mushi to report this to his superior. He describes the shadow as an island. At a distance, a silhouette of a giant elephant trumpets as it arrives just behind the Marine fleet.",

He tells her to ride around the island.\nRobin then explains what happened the night they lost their memories. They deduce that only those who fell asleep lost their memories, and that the child stole their memories by playing the low-pitched horn. Luffy figures that although their old memories had been lost, they would just make new memories through their adventures.\nA flashback is shown of Zoro, telling Kuina that either one of them will become the world's strongest swordsman. Kuina's father tells Zoro that Kuina's dream has been passed to him, giving him the Wado Ichimonji. Back in present day, the boy approaches Zoro, but is noticed.\nMeanwhile, Nami, who is bathing, wonders how the Straw Hats ended up as her nakama. She also wonders what happened to her Arlong Pirates tattoo, having forgotten the events of the Arlong Park Arc. A flashback is shown of Nami joining the Arlong Pirates.\nBack to present day, the boy stands on the ship's figurehead and blows the horn. Robin confronts him, waking up all the Straw Hats in the process. Angry, the boy attempts to blow into his horn a sleeping spell, but is confronted by Luffy for sitting on the figurehead. The horn emits a blue, sparkling dust that flows into Luffy's mouth. The boy escapes, but when Luffy wakes up, he regains his memory.",

Despite several powerful attacks being levied against him, Kaidou unleashes a series of powerful counterattacks, including Daiitoku Raimei Hakke. With a final attack setting Luffy on fire, Kaidou claims that Haki is more fundamental to combat strength than Devil Fruit abilities, as neither Roger nor Oden ate a Devil Fruit.\nInside the Skull Dome below, the remaining allied forces realize that if Luffy wins the battle, Onigashima would still crash, killing them. Willing to sacrifice their lives to remove Kaidou from power, the allies cheer on Luffy and hope for his victory against Kaidou.\nLuffy hears the cheering from the Skull Dome and prepares a final attack against Kaidou, inflating his fist to a size as large as Onigashima itself.

Zoro observed the attack from the rooftop, musing about Luffy being trapped in the crossfire and having to go rescue him. As Igaram continued his attack, he yells for Vivi to escape, but she can only watch in terror.\nAmidst the smoke and gunfire, Mr. 5 launched a projectile at Igaram, who is promptly consumed in a powerful explosion as both Vivi and Mr. 9 watch in shock. The smoke began to clear, and Igaram, severely injured, fell. Vivi called out to him in terror, but was interrupted by Miss Valentine, who attacked Vivi after telling her it is useless. Vivi escaped with nothing but a broken hairband, and attempted to launch a counter-attack with her Peacock Slashers on Miss Valentine, who promptly floated out of range while laughing, and returned to Mr. 5's side. As Vivi seethed, Mr. 9 expressed his amazement at his partner's royal status; Vivi promptly yelled at him for doing so in the midst of a dangerous situation. Zoro, meanwhile, took the chance to drag off a still sleeping, still bloated Luffy. Igaram, still somehow conscious, begged Vivi to abandon him and escape, for the sake of their home Alabasta. Mr. 5 proceeded to pick his nose while calmly stating that it is impossible for Vivi to escape. Enraged, Vivi drew her other Peacock Slasher and challenged the Baroque Works agent. Before she can attack however, Mr. 9 stands between her and the pair of assassins. While admitting confusion at the situation, Mr. 9 recounts how long he and Vivi have worked together, and told her to run as he buys her some time. As Vivi thanked him, Mr. 9 says his goodbyes and proceeds to charge at Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine with his acrobatics.\nMr. 5 stated that all that is required of agents is to do their jobs effectively while he pulled out a booger from his nose, chastising Mr. 9 for forming a friendship with his partner. When Mr. 9 attempted to attack, Mr. 5 aims the booger and launched it at Mr. 9, which proceeded to explode and send Mr. 9 flying clear into the river. Vivi watched this in horror, while Zoro observed in bewilderment. While Zoro was distracted, Igaram grabs Zoro's leg, which surprised the pirate swordsman. Igaram stated that he has a \"most unfair\" request of Zoro, but required someone of his strength. Igaram continued, saying that both of the agents have Devil Fruit powers, and that he Igaram was hopelessly outmatched against them. As such, Igaram begged Zoro to protect Vivi in his place. All the while, Zoro was struggling to get Igaram to let go of his leg.\nMiss Valentine laughed at the situation while Mr. 5 picked his nose, and Vivi hopped on Karoo's back, commanding him to run. Miss Valentine commented on this, while Mr. 5 states that Vivi will not get far before chasing after her, Miss Valentine followed right behind him.\nDespite his injuries, Igaram continued to beg Zoro to protect Vivi, promising riches in return for doing so. Zoro angrily refused, mentioning how Igaram and his group had just been attempting to kill Zoro. However, Nami interjected, having overheard the conversation from a rooftop- and the mention of a reward. Nami stated that she will take the job, but only in return for 1 billion. Igaram was shocked at Nami's price, while Zoro and Nami converse. Zoro expressed surprise that Nami was awake, while she retorts that it had all been an act, not trusting \"a town that welcomes Pirates\". She then turned her attention to Igaram, and said that if he wanted Vivi to escape alive, he had better promise the reward of 1 billion. Igaram stated that his status prevented him from offering such a reward, but Nami retorts by emphasizing the danger to Vivi's life. Desperate, Igaram stated that while he cannot make any promises, the crew could negotiate a reward with Vivi herself. Nami mentions that this would require keeping up their part of the deal, but Igaram pleaded desperately. Nami relented, and proceeded to order Zoro to save Vivi, much to the swordsman's anger, saying that he is not going to get involved in Nami's schemes. Nami attempted to explain business to Zoro, but he refuses to fall for her explanation. Nami makes light of the situation, while Zoro vented his frustration at her attempting to order him around just as she took advantage of Sanji. During their conversation, Luffy finally wakes from his slumber.\nNami insults Zoro and says that he is just afraid of losing, while Zoro is quickly losing what remains of his patience. A bloated Luffy, still half-asleep, walks by the two obliviously in order to find the facilities. Nami then brings up the loan she gave Zoro, but he counters by mentioning that he did not even spend any of it. Nonetheless, Nami counters by saying that he promised to pay her back in 300% interest, bringing his due to 300,000. Zoro is shocked that Nami expects him to pay her back when he did not spend any of the money in the first place, but Nami persists. She then proceeds to question whether or not Zoro can even keep one little promise (apparently hitting a sore spot), leaving Zoro shocked, furious, and silent. While Zoro grumbles about Nami dying a horrible death, he nonetheless relents and leaves to find Vivi. Igaram muses about his own apparent uselessness, but Nami comforts him by telling Igaram how strong Zoro is. Nonetheless, Igaram morbidly goes on about how Alabasta would be doomed if Vivi died, confusing Nami.\nVivi and Karoo continue to flee, with the intention of stealing a ship and fleeing back to Alabasta.\nA still-bloated Luffy relieves himself in a river before intending to go back to sleep, but comes across the carnage that Zoro left behind.\nVivi and Karoo continue running away, but are promptly intercepted by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine. Vivi and Karoo run a different route and are met by Miss Monday, who explains that they can reach the ships by taking the path behind her, explaining that she will hold off Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine while Vivi makes her escape. Vivi hesitates, but Miss Monday explains that the loss to Zoro means punishment already awaits, so she might as well go down while protecting her friend. She then yells at Vivi to stop waiting around and flee, saying that otherwise Igaram and Mr. 9's sacrifices would be in vain. Vivi thanks Miss Monday before she and Karoo run away again, leaving Miss Monday to face Mr. 5. While Mr. 5 muses about both her and Mr. 9's defection, Miss Monday remains determined to prevent him from passing. Miss Valentine mocks Miss Monday's resolve, while Mr. 5 rushes Miss Monday, calling her a disgrace. Miss Monday attempts to attack, but Mr. 5 dodges and clotheslines her, causing a powerful explosion. Hearing the explosion, Vivi temporarily halts her escape to look back as her friend is defeated, seeing an inferno. She can only stare in utter horror as her friend got beaten.\nVivi is shocked at the brutality, while Mr. 5 explains his powers are from the Bomu Bomu no Mi and that he has yet to fail a mission. Miss Valentine then explains her own powers, originating from the Kiro Kiro no Mi. Miss Valentine then uses her powers to turn herself into a living missile and slam down on Miss Monday with the weight of 10,000 kilograms. Upon standing up, the pair condescendingly state that it is futile for Vivi to escape, and that she does not stand a chance. Vivi however, remains determined to return to Alabasta and save her kingdom. Mr. 5 prepares to attack, but Zoro intercepts, saving a shocked Vivi. Vivi, believing Zoro to still be an enemy, prepares to attack him, but Zoro cuts Vivi's weapon and holds the edge of his blade at her throat, followed by explaining that he is here to help and she needs to calm down.\nMeanwhile, Nami and Igaram continue talking, with Nami questioning just what Baroque Works is. Igaram hesitates, but then explains that the Baroque Works is a crime syndicate, specializing in sabotage, assassination, and bounty-hunting, and so secretive that none of the agents know the boss' name or face, but will nonetheless act on his orders. Nami questions this logic, but Igaram goes on to say that Baroque Work's primary goal is to create a Utopia, and that those who do their part get a higher standing in said nation. He then continues, explaining the codename and rank system within Baroque Works.\nMiss Valentine guesses that Zoro is the one who defeated all of the \"lowly employees\" in Whisky Peak, while Mr. 5 questions as to why Zoro would want to get involved in protecting Vivi. Zoro simply states that he has his own reasons, while Mr. 5 says that they will have to eliminate Zoro for his interference. Zoro and Mr. 5 prepare to fight, but are interrupted by the shout of an enraged Luffy. While Vivi is confused, Zoro states that while glad to have Luffy's assistance, he can handle the attackers. However, Luffy proceeds to yell threats at Zoro, much to the swordsman's shock and confusion. While Zoro questions what Luffy could be asking, Luffy angrily explains how he came across the men Zoro fought, and was tricked into believing Zoro attacked unprovoked. Zoro attempts to explain, but Luffy ignores him and yells at Zoro to fight him. Vivi comments on Luffy's lack of intelligence (to Karoo's agreement), while Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine discuss letting the two kill each other off. Zoro continues his attempts at explanation, but Luffy will not have and attacks. Zoro dodges Luffy's assault while attempting to calm down his captain. Miss Valentine and Mr. 5 muse from the sidelines before deciding to return to their mission: eliminating Princess Vivi. However, Zoro kicks the bloated rubber man into the pair, sending the three of them flying. Having had enough interference, Mr. 5 explains his intentions to kill both Luffy and Zoro, and attacks Luffy while Zoro and Vivi watch from a distance. In the midst of the explosions, Miss Valentine flies up and prepares to attack Zoro and Vivi. Vivi tells Zoro to flee, but Zoro interrupts her. Luffy then steps out of the smoke, having digested the food that he ate and dragging a beaten and bloodied Mr. 5. Vivi is utterly shocked at Luffy's victory over such a powerful foe. Luffy turns his attention back to Zoro, who tries to explain the situation. Miss Valentine floats above the swordsman and tries to explain her powers, but becomes quite angry when she finds she is being ignored.\nLuffy does not believe Zoro's explanation (based on the concept that enemies would not give them such tasty food); Zoro is done attempting to explain, and casually dodges Miss Valentine's attack attempt, and prepares to fight Luffy. While Vivi is confused, the crew mates charge each other, launching a Gomu Gomu no Bazooka and Oni Giri respectively, the attacks cancelling each other out as the two grapple. Zoro and Luffy decide to test steel against rubber, and Zoro launches a Tatsu Maki, flinging Luffy into the air. To Zoro's surprise, Luffy is able to launch a Gomu Gomu no Pistol, landing a direct hit as they both slam into walls. Vivi ponders the situation as she and Karoo warily tread the battlefield, before both Luffy and Zoro break out of the rubble and resume their attacks. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine observe the ferocious battle, Mr. 5 commenting that the pair are making fools of them on their own turf, and that Baroque Works will be shamed if they fail their mission. The two charge headlong into the battle, but are promptly disposed of by the captain and Zoro for interrupting their battle.",

        "short_summary": "Luffy, Buggy, and Galdino find themselves on Level 3, a barren floor of extreme heat. There they are caught in a Seastone net by Saldeath, the imp-like commander of the Blugori. However, thanks to the interference of the Sphinx, they manage to escape. Buggy and Galdino manage to get away from Luffy, and they encounter the imprisoned Baroque Works agent, Bentham, whose stay in the dungeon has not dampened his spirits one bit.",
        "long_summary": "Some of the guards on Level 2 report a massive hole made by Luffy and his party. As they complain that the Sphinx might have fallen down, the Level 2 cells open and the prisoners begin to trudge out. They move in on the guards filled with vengeance and thank Buggy for freeing them. They send the guards clinging for life. As the Blugoris are ordered to Level 2, word from Sengoku informs that Luffy and Ace are brothers because of the D.\nMeanwhile at Marine Headquarters, Sengoku berates Garp over his humor at Luffy's actions. After telling him of Luffy's actions at Enies Lobby and the Sabaody Archipelago, Sengoku fears it unprecedented now that Impel Down is in uproar from a riot. However, he is confident that Impel Down is an impregnable symbol of justice. Garp is just relaxing eating from cookies. Sengoku informs the vice-admiral that Tsuru and he needs to keep the incident under wraps and confiscates the cookies.\nAt Impel Down, Luffy, his party and the Sphinx have landed on Level 3, as it resembles a hot desert with the sand being hot. Buggy complains about he never wanted to be on Level 3, and Galdino complains that his wax is melting from the heat. With no idea on where the stairs are, Luffy and his group decide to search. As the heat begins to wear them down, they spot a hummingbird collapse from the heat. Luffy begins to taste the fried bird.\nThen, Buggy spots some prison cells in the distance and hopes they will gain access to the next stairwell. Luffy spots some prisoners who have endured the torturous heat, and are given very little to eat or drink. This is called the Starvation Hell. If they stay too long, they will crumble into sand. Buggy wants to take the stairs on the left, while Galdino hopes the pass on the right will lead them downward. A guard informs someone of Luffy's progress and the man on the other end says all is according to plan.\nMeanwhile, more prisoners continue to fight through with no way for the guards to contact Magellan.\nBuggy complains the party came back to where they started. As Buggy and Galdino protest going any further, a seastone net is deployed, capturing Luffy and his group. No one is able to break free. More guards with Blugoris arrive to apprehend them. They are led a little imp-like man named Saldeath. Luffy confuses Saldeath's identity for a salmon. The guard informs Luffy that the other guards are demons below them. Sphinx wakes up and begins to shake the net before breaking through crying out food names.\nAs the guards give chase to Luffy's group, the young pirate takes some down with his Gum-Gum Gatling. Mr. 3 and Buggy decide to desert Luffy planning to sacrifice him. With the guards converging, Luffy continues to fight his way through the guards. Sphinx is now on a rampage so the straw Hat captain uses the distraction to flee.\nIn the elevator, Magellan informs Hancock that their party will soon reach Ace's cell block. That area is filled with the most notorious criminals and Hancock requested access. The giant warden also informs of another ex-Warlord being held prisoner.\nAs Buggy and Galdino recover, the staircase going upward is closed off. They then hear French counting that Galdino seems to recognize. From his cell, Bentham performs a song with his cellmates before blowing a kiss.",

        "long_summary": "Luffy continues fighting Katakuri in the Mirro-World, and Katakuri's sister Flampe looks on as she prepares to shoot Luffy with her blowgun. Luffy keeps attempting to strengthen his Observation Haki and foresee Katakuri's attacks, and although he is not on Katakuri's level yet and continues getting pummeled as a result, he is developing it very rapidly. Katakuri recognizes this, and as he realizes he needs to finish Luffy off quickly, Flampe successfully shoots Luffy in the leg with a blowdart. The dart causes Luffy's leg to numb, rendering him unable to dodge as Katakuri attacks him with Mochi Tsuki, which results in Mogura dealing a gruesome wound to his side. Katakuri expresses his disappointment in Luffy while Flampe laughs in secrecy, and although Luffy manages to get back up, he is utterly overpowered by Katakuri's kick. Flampe delights in what she did, imagining that Katakuri will be proud of her afterwards and think of her as his favorite little sister. Luffy tries to dodge further strikes from Mogura, but is unable to get back in the fight as Katakuri pummels him with multiple mochi fists created from Muso Donuts, leaving him unmoving in a crater on the ground.\nOn Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or expresses his disbelief that the Whole Cake Chateau's collapse was the Straw Hats' doing, and Count Niwatori says that if they are this good at planning, they might pull off something unexpected. Swearing to not let that happen, Mont-d'Or contacts the Tartes, telling all of them to go to Cacao Island and bring an end to the Straw Hats. Out at sea, Bege calls Perospero, and the former says that they will put an end to Big Mom's hunger pangs with the cake, pointing out that Pudding made it. Perospero is still suspicious that the Fire Tank Pirates will try to assassinate Big Mom again, and tells Bavarois that their fleet will pursue Big Mom and Bege while Smoothie's fleet continues pursuing the Straw Hats. Perospero contacts Smoothie to tell her about this plan, saying that her fleet should sink the Straw Hats before they reach Cacao Island. Smoothie, her sisters Citron and Cinnamon, and her subordinates then prepare to attack.\nWhile sailing away from Big Mom, Bege says that he cares more about escaping than assassinating Big Mom, but Chiffon reminds him they have a debt to pay to the Straw Hats and so need to keep them safe from Big Mom. Meanwhile, the Sunny crew finds out from Sanji that the Big Mom Pirates know about their plan to go to Cacao Island, and although they are on track to get there in time, their situation is made worse as Smoothie's ship comes and confronts them. However, Sanji gets an idea to rescue Luffy from the Big Mom Pirates' assured lockdown of the island. On Cacao Island, scores of Tarte ships arrive to besiege it; the people who arrive are skeptical that this much force is necessary and some do not even believe Luffy will escape Katakuri and the Mirro-World, but Oven points them to Mont-d'Or, who tells them via Den Den Mushi about the Straw Hats' responsibility for destroying the Chateau. Oven tells his crew to destroy every mirror on Cacao Island, so that if Luffy arrives he will come from the lone mirror remaining right in front of them. The people are reluctant to destroy their valuable mirrors, but Oven says they can throw them into water, threatening to kill the families of anyone who does not comply.\nBack in the Mirro-World, Katakuri stands over the unmoving Luffy, lamenting at how the pirate had faltered right as he was starting to respect him. Luffy is still alive, however, and remembers training his Observation Haki with Silvers Rayleigh. A blindfolded Luffy had celebrated dodging one of Rayleigh's strikes, saying it felt like he had imagined the attack coming. Rayleigh replied that Observation Haki is an extension of the imagination, but Luffy needed to develop it to become instinctual. Luffy then wakes up and pulls himself up, much to Katakuri and Flampe's surprise. Flampe attempts to attack Luffy again, shooting a numbing needle ten times as strong as the last one. Luffy manages to see it coming and dodge it, but ends up falling over afterwards, causing Flampe and her subordinates to laugh uncontrollably. Despite their attempts to subdue it, Katakuri ends up overhearing them, and begins to realize that he and Luffy are not alone.",

On the third floor, Raizo and Fukurokuju are still at a standstill with neither one of them releasing their Paralysis Jutsu despite both being caught on fire. On the second floor, Jinbe helps some samurai escape by preventing them from being crushed by fallen debris and pointing out a route to their escape.\nOn the Performance Floor, Chopper returns to his normal form and is now able to move. He worries for Zoro whom he knows will be suffering twice as bad due to the special medicine which was administered to him in exchange for his temporary super healing. Outside, Zoro is slowly bleeding out. As his blood seeps into the ground, he wakes up in a desolate area. A dark apparition appears before him, resembling a grim reaper. With its scythe, it prepares to swing at Zoro who is frozen in place, calling out to the reaper to stop. Meanwhile, at the Right-Brain Tower, Franky searches for Zoro.\nElsewhere, Izou is finishing off the last of the Beasts Pirates who have been relentlessly attacking him. Weakened, he is easily stabbed in the stomach by a pirate who he shoots to death. He staggers away, using the wall to keep himself up. As he makes his way out of the castle, he hopes that Kin\u2019emon and Kiku have escaped successfully. He comes across the CP0 agents who were after Robin. The agents tell him that they should pretend not to see each other as they had no intention of going after the last remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates since their business right now is with the Straw Hats. Instead of letting them go, however, Izou tells them to stop.\nYamato has finally reached the armory where the bombs are located. Kazenbo also reaches the armory preparing to set fire to the explosives therein. Yamato transforms and uses his Namuji Hyoga technique which freezes everything inside. He then swings at the flame specter, determined to stop it from fulfilling the command given to it by Kanjuro and Orochi. It proceeds to engulf Yamato in flames, with the latter screaming in pain.\nBack at the Performance Floor, Big Mom continues to wreak havoc with her lightning attacks, knocking back Law and Kid. She remembers that Kaidou is on the rooftop fighting Luffy and wonders why she still has not heard the emperor\u2019s shout of victory. She commands Hera to take her to the rooftop, but Law stops her with K-ROOM. He impales her with his sword and uses Shock Wille, causing her to fall. Kid proceeds to charge at her with his Punk Corna Dio. As Kid and Law prepare to fight her once again, they vow that they will never let her go to the rooftop even if it means their death.",

With Ace now glowing with fire and free-falling with Luffy, Ivankov cries with joy that the latter's father would be happy. Hancock praises Luffy hoping he will have a happy ending with here and wants to marry him after leaving Marineford. Helmeppo is in shock while Koby accepts that Luffy is just as he is. As the Marines are about to fire a second barrage, Ace suggests splitting up, with the Straw Hat pirate throwing Galdino aside. The fiery pirate then uses a Flame Commandment and Fire Pillar burning some Marines and blowing them back.\nAce and Luffy land safely while Galdino hurts himself on the ground. The former surrounds their party with a ring of fire and asks if Luffy can still fight. Luffy answers positively. Ace while surprised that his brother would save him decides to go against his pride. Luffy laughs saying he couldn't have done it alone. The two are hit by bullets with no effect, and Luffy deflects the bullets. Two marines try to cut him, but Ace blocks the hit and heals immediately. He then uses a Fire Fist permeating the Marines around the brothers. Luffy goes into Second Gear, dodging an attack and using a Gum-Gum Jet Spear to hit some officers hard. Ace then shoots some Fire Gun shots out of his fingers hitting more officers. A Marine with a mace almost crushes the fiery pirate, but Luffy knocks him away.

Luffy blows more enemies back with Gum-Gum Jet Gatling. As the two continue their fight, they look back to their younger days when they raced to a beach. Now running in the present Ace admires how tough Luffy has become while they think of the fights they had in their youth. Luffy admits he hopes to be stronger than his brother, but then their path is blocked by Aokiji. The ice Admiral says they won't live to see the dawn. Ace prepares to engage the admiral who readies an Ice Block and shoots a Pheasant Beak, while the pirate shoots a Flame Mirror. Their attacks dissolve slowly. With the marines in shock, Vista's party charges forward not blaming Ace for showing off a bit.\nMeanwhile, Buggy wants a Den Den Mushi repaired so he can show off again that he wants to wear down Luffy and assassinate Whitebeard. When that's done, Buggy plans to be one of the Four Emperors. Watching Ace and Luffy flee, Galdino thinks about Mr. 2's memory and wishes to leave, but is spotted by some Marines seeing through his disguise.\nSengoku recovers infuriated at the blunder while Doflamingo wants to let Luffy and Ace slide. But Momonga gives chase. As some marines are confused on what to do, Akainu orders them to pull themselves together and assures that escape for Ace and Luffy is impossible. Just then, a paddle-boat runs aground scaring the Marines with Squard aboard. Squard tells Whitebeard to leave hoping to show their enemies the pride of the Maelstrom Spider Pirates. Whitebeard thinks Squard is out of his mind.\nSome of the pirates think Squard has a death wish and the latter hopes to atone for his stabbing of Whitebeard by heroically sacrificing himself. The Maelstrom Spider Pirate captain is sad that his crew came with him, but they went at their own discretion. Hearing their word, Squard orders the pirates to get Ace out of there. Ace fires a St. Elmo's Fire beam at some marines and is surprised by Squard's actions. Marco worries that sadness will be the result before demanding the Seastone Cuffs be removed from his wrist.\nSquard's party charges forward ready to go down fighting, but Whitebeard stops the paddle-boat even on the brink of death. The white-bearded pirate says how it's cruel for a father to bury his own sons and says that everyone needs to grow old and die one day. With their business at Marineford finished, Whitebeard orders full retreat while he stays behind to keep his sons from further harm.\nWhitebeard stands firm ready to give one last order to his crew. The pirates protest as they wanted to leave together. While Ace fires a Cross Fire cross, Whitebeard goes on saying that even families must part ways and wishes for his crews to go back to the New World and continue their legacy. With his era coming to a close, Whitebeard says that no ship can carry him to the new age. He causes a quake that begins to break up Marineford imploring the pirates to evacuate and forge their own path. Rakuyo doesn't want his captain to stay behind, while Luffy and Ace protest as well. Giving a proud smile to his sons, he wishes them a new age. He also thinks of the time he spent with his crew as it was a long journey with them. With a smile, Whitebeard yells he will end the fight once and for all.",

        "long_summary": "After Bege reverts back to his normal body and Caesar and Germa 66 emerge from it, Bege and Caesar are left out in the open, and the Big Mom Pirates quickly take the opportunity to shoot at them mercilessly. However, Ichiji, Niji, Yonji, and Reiju shield them from the bullets. Caesar then grabs Bege and flies off with Germa accompanying him, and Katakuri foresees that they are trying to fly over the wall and escape from the wedding venue. Judge attacks Katakuri but misses, and the Big Mom Pirates leap up to attack their enemies. However, Big Mom stops them as she throws Prometheus toward the enemy pirates. Reiju takes the brunt of the blast, and is eventually overwhelmed and falls onto the ground. Luffy wants to leave Bege to help Reiju, but his crewmates hold him back. Mascarpone and Joscarpone attempt to attack her while she is down, but Reiju quickly responds by kicking them in the necks and poisoning them. Smoothie comes to remove the poison from her siblings, while Big Mom prepares to attack Reiju with Zeus. However, both Luffy and Sanji leap out of Bege and block the attack, and both of them are annoyed that the other came with them.\nNami, Chopper, and Brook are aghast at Luffy and Sanji's action, and after the clash, Sanji quickly grabs Luffy and they and Reiju run away from Big Mom. She calls out to Luffy, reminding him that he had promised to defeat her and wondering why he is running away. In response for her taunts, Luffy goes back to punch her once, despite Sanji's pleas. He activates Gear 4 and attacks Big Mom with Kong Gun, saying that he would become Pirate King, but she counters by simply coating her arms in Armament Haki. Meanwhile, the Big Mom Pirates attempt to shoot Caesar in the air, but their bullets are again blocked by Germa. Vito assures the Straw Hats that his idols the Germa will protect them, and when High-Fat and Noisette leap up to attack, Niji beats them away with Dengeki Blue. Mobile, Laurin, and Mash then move to attack, but Yonji grabs the latter two and throws them into Mobile, sending them crashing into the ground. Dacquoise, Zuccotto, and Kato then attack, but Ichiji easily deals with them. He then flies toward Dacquoise and dodges his shots before punching him in the chest with Sparking Red, forcing him back onto the ground. As Germa protects him and his allies, Vito gazes at them in awe.\nThe Big Mom Pirates' assault continues as Oven leaps up right in front of Caesar and heats up his fists. However, Yonji intercepts the attack, allowing Caesar to fly away. Oven makes his fists too hot for Yonji to handle, forcing Yonji to separate from him as they confront each other. Daifuku then summons his genie to confront Caesar, but Niji steps in. Niji meets the genie's halberd with a kick, and their massive clash causes the genie to dissipate. Smoothie then jumps up, preparing to squeeze Caesar and Bege, but she is stopped by Ichiji. The two dodge each others' strikes, and Smoothie grabs Ichiji's leg as he attempts to fly away, but he manages to increase his jet power enough to escape her grasp. The Big Mom Pirates continue their pursuit, and Bege's subordinates attempt to shoot them from inside his body, but Judge arrives to take them down. Caesar gets very close to the wall and freedom, but Perospero erects a candy wall that converges down on him. However, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji come rushing in and combine their abilities in an attack on the wall that completely shatters it, and the Straw Hats cheer on Caesar as he nears the home stretch.\nMeanwhile, Lu Feld is relieved that the Tamatebako landed on a ledge of the Whole Cake Chateau only a short distance below. He prepares to go get it, when he is confronted by Stussy. During this encounter, the frosting under Feld gives way, causing him to fall onto the ledge where the Tamatebako is. He excitedly goes to open it, only to be shot by Stussy's Tobu Shigan; being revealed to be an undercover CP0 agent, she declares that the Tamatebako will go to the World Government. She makes sure that Morgans, who is spying on this exchange, will blame the theft on Feld in his newspaper in exchange for getting to see its contents. However, Feld's unconscious body leans on the Tamatebako and pushes it off the Chateau, to Stussy and Morgans' shock. Meanwhile, Luffy declares he will defeat Big Mom after he takes down Kaidou as he attacks Big Mom with a two-armed strike. Big Mom manages to repel him, and her blow causes Luffy to deactivate Gear 4, forcing Sanji to grab him and run away. Big Mom says that Luffy beating Kaidou is impossible, but he will not even get the chance to try because he will not escape from her territory. As she races toward Luffy, Judge comes flying in and attacks her, expressing his shame over the fact that he was duped in his quest to restore the glory days of Germa. However, Big Mom catches his spear in her teeth and destroys it. Judge unsuccessfully tries attacking her again, and she grabs him, saying that he can be assured she will use his scientific technology to bring peace to the world. She then uses Zeus to strike him with a massive thunderbolt.",

Bellamy refuses to listen and continues his assault on Luffy.\nMansherry attempts to flirt with Leo and asks him to carry her since she hurt her legs. Leo obliviously thinks her selfish side showed up and says she can just heal herself since she's always been very fast. This upsets Mansherry stating she's not running and didn't ask Leo to save her. Leo is angered about her mood swings and is whacked over the head by Kabu telling him to just carry her stating they don't have time to mess around. Leo carries her on his back complaining about her attitude while the Princess is happy to have him carry her while Kabu notes Leo is so thick, noting that Mansherry is polite and kind to everyone but Leo due to her feelings for him. Just as they leave Giolla regains consciousness commenting she must alert Doflamingo immediately. Knowing his calculations of Mansherry's Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers to restore anything at the cost of one's lifespan, that should anything happen to the SMILE Factory, it can easily be restored to its original form. She is unable to move and pleads with Senor Pink to protect it at all cost.\nAt the SMILE factory, Franky and Pink are still at it with the cyborg landing a Strong Hammer on Pink's face. However, Pink uses the momentum to dive underground and grab Franky from behind using his MeowMeow Suplex again. Both then fall over exhausted from their injuries. The Dwarves and fans alike note they are both at their limit while asking them both why they don't dodge their attacks, stating they took them both on 30 times each. Franky states when a man is offered a drink he can't turn away from it stating Pink is a hard man. He shouts he will not dodge a single attack and take them all one and come out on top saying that is his \"strong style\". He knows the Dwarves are worried but it is a duel between men and promises he will win in his own way and won't let them become slaves again.\nSenor Pink is touched by these words and states he'll remember them stating he's not as young as he used to be and will finish this with the next move, prompting one of his fans to note how far away he is. He then asks if what Franky said is true and that men don't go back on their word if he takes his attack without dodging. He swims towards Franky telling him to try to survive this next move proclaiming if he does survive he will admit defeat and take any punishment from Franky. Franky says it's a deal while being grabbed by Pink and swam outside the factory up a tower, much to the shock of the Dwarves. Pink notes how the sky is darker than usual wishing he could keep going up higher to see his wife Russian and his son Gimlet but gravity is between them, prompting Franky to ask what he means. Pink reveals he knew of Franky's cyborg body and how is back is his weak spot and unleashes a devastating attack called \"Baby Buster\" crashing Franky into the ground. As Pink emerges seemingly victorious, he turns around shocked to see Franky, who's left eye seems to be more cybernetic now, emerges from the rubble. Pink keeps true to his word and admits defeat while apologizing to the Young Master. Franky unleashes a brutal \"Franky Iron Boxing\" on Pink, thrashing him around with his enlarged fists.\nWhile being assaulted, Pink reminisces the first time he met Russian on a rainy day for their first date. When she says she hates pirates she asks Pink what he does and he lies about being a banker. In time they marry and have a son named Gimlet. He juggles his duties to his family and crew and returns one day to discover of Gimlet's death. Russian reveals he had a fever a week ago just as Pink disappeared and the doctor's couldn't help him. She reveals his lies shouting she called the bank and they never heard of him demanding to know who he really is. She angrily slaps him and runs off telling him to not follow her. However, she fell in a landslide from the rain and sand and was buried on top leaving her in a vegetative state stating she does not have long to live. Pink can only grieve over her condition blaming himself for her and Gimlet's fates. He then regularly visits her for the next year doing everything in his power to get her to smile again. He wishes to hear her voice and see her smile even a little so he puts on Gimlet's bonnet since he had his face. Just as he puts it away thinking it wasn't funny he's shocked to see Russian smile.",

After the prisoners collapse, Bentham spots Buggy and Galdino outside his cell and is surprised to see the latter. The former Mr. 2 complains he was the one captured. The two pirates insist on not letting Bentham loose.\nLuffy races down the stairs while Bentham, freed from his cell is informed that their old enemy is racing down the stairs. Bentham then begins to spin away.\nMeanwhile, the alarms blare as the marine complain about Luffy's progress. This action would humiliate the World Government including Impel Down. As they prepare to head inside, a scantily clad woman guard named Sadi-chan appears. She is the commander of the Demon Guards. Sadi whips a marine for not saying chan in the back. Daigin realizes that the guards won't even need the Marines help in capturing Luffy so they can wait outside. Daigin reluctantly agrees and a suspicious koala-like demon is spotted. All entrances to Impel Down are then shuttered.\nOn Level 6, Magellan's party escorts Hancock to Ace's holding cell. Hannyabal expects Ace to behave, Jinbe is his special guest and Boa Hancock is visiting him. He hopes that when he is warden, Hancock will marry Hannyabal, but Jinbe shuts him up. Some of the prisoners become enamored to Hancock's presence, but she speaks to Ace about the war that is to come. Jinbe knows that almost all of the summons to Hancock have been rejected. Magellan is insulted when he tries to quiet the prisoners. The Snake Princess she'll be scared from the prisoner's sexist callings. As the prisoners continue to call to Hancock, Magellan fumes and becomes a large mass of poison before summoning poisonous dragons to teach the prisoners a lesson.\nMagellan deploys the Hydra, three poisonous dragon heads over Hancock's conversation with Ace. The dragons breach the cells of the prisoners who are horrified and one of them is poisoned to the point where one would die. As Hancock leaves, Ace worries that his visitor told a truth.

As the guards take aim, he barely dodges some seastone nets and meets with Sphinx again. Just then, Zoro arrives posing like a ballerina suddenly. He calls out to his \"pal\" and reveals his voice as Bentham, Mr. 2 Bon Clay who befriended Luffy back on Arabasta. He uses Swan Arabesque to incapacitate Sphinx.\nAfter heroically sacrificing himself to divert Hina, Bentham was captured and brought to Impel Down. Luffy is delighted even though he'd rather have Zoro with him. Bentham then kicks through the guards daring them to hurt his friend. He and Luffy also further beat up Sphinx to teach it the law of the jungle.\nLuffy and Bentham hug as swans never die, unless it's true. Saldeath complains about Bentham's persistence and sends some Blugoris at them. The ballerina-like man knows that Luffy wants to get to Level 5.

Sanji returns to the Sunny and the Straw Hats continue their course for Cacao Island.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy manages to predict Katakuri's attack and counter it, which surprises Katakuri as he realizes that Luffy's Observation Haki is developing. However, Katakuri manages to lay more hits on Luffy after this, and as Luffy attempts to see whether Katakuri will attack with Mogura or his mochi donuts next, Katakuri notes that Luffy's precognition is not as developed as his own and attacks with both. Luffy does his best to dodge the attacks, but his fatigue begins catching up with him and, despite occasional good moves, he continues to be overwhelmed. Luffy eventually ends up lying on the ground, and Katakuri tells him not to get up, saying that the Big Mom Pirates had heard about his plan to meet with his crew on Cacao Island and are lying in wait for him there if he somehow manages to emerge from this. However, to Katakuri's surprise, Luffy does not see this as a problem. As the two of them continue fighting, Flampe believes the fight will finish soon as she aims at the unsuspecting Luffy with her blowgun.\nOn the Nostra Castello, one of the chefs reveals that he neglected to add frosting roses to the top of the wedding cake, and could not do so now that the cake was otherwise complete. The chefs begin to panic, but Sanji then steps in and offers to to it. Using Sky Walk, he flies to the top of the cake and adds the frosting roses perfectly, causing Pudding, Chiffon, and the chefs to celebrate. With the cake now completed, Sanji looks forward to seeing his crew again, but Pudding's sadistic side comes out and suggests that the crew might already have been killed, much to the horror of her more pleasant personality when she is reprimanded by Chiffon. She, Chiffon, and the chefs then collapse from exhaustion, and Bege looks forward to Big Mom eating the cake, saying there is no need to poison it as he hopes that Big Mom will die from its deliciousness.\nMeanwhile, Big Mom catches back up to the Sunny as she flies on Prometheus. Chopper activates Monster Point to deal with her, but is quickly overwhelmed and injured by Big Mom's sword strikes with Napoleon. Prometheus breathes fire at the Sunny, forcing both Nami and Brook to work to stop the oncoming flames. The Sunny crew refuses to go down without a fight, but Prometheus then expands massively, causing him to torch the Sunny with his heat, and Jinbe says that the sun homie is too big to stop with sea water. All Chopper can do is try to coerce Big Mom to come back down so he can pull her with him into the ocean, but Nami then notices the Nostra Castello approaching, and Big Mom catches the scent of the wedding cake. The Sunny crew rejoices as she heads toward it, and Bege prepares to lure her toward him. Sanji agrees that he can do whatever he likes to her after she eats the cake, and he prepares to head to the Sunny with Pudding on Rabiyan. Pudding bids farewell to Chiffon, and is happy to see her sister living happily with people she loves. Chiffon tells Pudding to not lose the source of her happiness, causing Pudding to become tense as she looks at Sanji. She and Sanji then fly off toward the Sunny, with Rabiyan going fast enough to avoid detection. Sanji reunites with his crewmates immediately after reaching the Sunny, and wonders where Carrot and Pedro are, to which Brook lies that they are both resting belowdeck. Meanwhile, Perospero notes that this situation is intended to split up the Big Mom Pirates. He looks at the cake and gets worried about it, knowing that Big Mom needs to eat it to save everyone from her rampage, but also knowing they will all be in danger if the cake turns out to be poisoned and kills her. He then receives a call from Bege as the Sunny crew begins to head out to Cacao Island.",

        "air_date": "October 1, 2017",
        "short_summary": "Luffy refuses to back down from the hostile Sanji, causing Sanji to confront him and attack him with Diable Jambe. Despite Sanji's vicious attacks, Luffy refuses to fight back or retreat, and Nami pleads Sanji to stop to no avail. Finally, Sanji knocks Luffy out with a spinning midair kick, and returns to his family. Luffy yells out to Sanji as he leaves, saying that he will stay at this spot and not eat until Sanji returns, as he cannot become the Pirate King without Sanji. This causes Sanji to break down in tears as he is taken to Big Mom.",
        "long_summary": "Remembering Judge's threats on his hands and Zeff during his return to the Germa Kingdom, Sanji stared in shock at Luffy as his captain raced toward him. Luffy grabbed onto the carriage to talk to Sanji directly, and with everything against him racing through his mind, Sanji made the decision to kick Luffy away and claim that he has forsaken the Straw Hats and embraced his royal heritage as prince Vinsmoke Sanji. Sanji claims that he will be happier in the ranks of the Big Mom Pirates, where he will be treated to power and luxury as opposed to the meager existence of the Straw Hats. He says that he has been looking down on Luffy and his crewmates the whole time and is willing to prove it as he activates Diable Jambe. He then charges at the motionless Luffy and kicks him in the face, sending him tumbling away.\nLuffy gets back up to face Sanji, who says that he should use Haki if he wants to live. Luffy replies that he has no need for Haki when he just wants to speak with Sanji, and Sanji tells Luffy to leave in that case. Luffy refuses, and Sanji calls him selfish as he strikes Luffy again. Luffy gets back up, and Nami pleads for Sanji to stop, saying that Luffy has pushed himself to the limit against Cracker just to get this far. However, Luffy silences Nami, saying this is a duel. Sanji then barrages Luffy with many kicks, but Luffy refuses to back down or fall, much to his chagrin. At last, Sanji has finally had enough and prepares to deal a finishing blow. He spins to reignite Diable Jambe before taking to the air with Sky Walk, spinning around in a fiery circle as he falls toward Luffy. He plants his heel into the top of Luffy's head with deadly force, and Luffy initially tries resisting it, but eventually succumbs to the power and falls unconscious.\nSanji walks back to the carriage as Luffy lies on the ground bleeding, and an anguished Nami races to Luffy's side. She then goes up to Sanji and slaps him, grimly apologizing for coming to rescue him before walking away. Sanji returns to his seat next to his impressed brothers, and as the carriage heads away, Luffy regains consciousness and calls out to Sanji. He says that he knows Sanji is putting on an act, and that Sanji was the one who was truly hurt by all the kicks he unleashed. Luffy proclaims that he cannot go on his journey and become Pirate King without Sanji, so he will wait in this spot and not eat anything until Sanji returns. Luffy's words cause Sanji to break down in tears, and his brothers laugh at him as they head out of sight of Luffy. A montage of Sanji's times with the crew is then shown as Luffy is shown lying down on the clearing.",
