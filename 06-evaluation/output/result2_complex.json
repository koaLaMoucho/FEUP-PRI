One of them says that he has heard a rumor about how other marines think that their base has gotten soft because they haven't seen action. Another vehemently argued that that is not true.\nMeanwhile a damaged marine warship was being fixed at a dock where workers were complaining that the ship would take a week to fix while another states that they had 3 days. In the background Mekao is seen drinking, muttering that in the old days people used to treat their ships with respect. He then gasped and dropped his bottle as he saw the Going Merry falling from the sky and shouted for everyone to look.\nThe ship is shown falling and Marines sounded the alarm saying that they are under attack from the sky. The Marines then get to their stations and then see the Going Merry and associate it with the Straw Hat Pirates.\nA lower ranking marine then goes and tells Lt. Commander Drake that pirates have invaded. He asks where Comm. Jonathan is, to which he replies he doesn't know.\nJonathan was then shown fishing Usopps's sniper goggles out of the water as he stared at the Going Merry while the Marines tell the Straw hats that resistance is futile and they can't escape.\nIn the kitchen, two cooks were talking about the commotion outside and get slapped with a ladle by the head chef Jessica who yelled at them for wasting time that they could be spent on preparing food for the soldiers at the base.\nJonathan was then shown walking into his office where Drake was waiting for him. Drake asked where he had been as Jonathan threw his fishing rod and hat into Drake's arms saying he didn't catch anything. Drake begins to tell him if he is absent all the time it causes problems, but was stopped by Jonathan. A marine comes to report that all the eyewitnesses claim they saw a ghost and that the ship must be a ghost ship. Drake berated the marine to report something of significance and to only come back with something useful.\nThe Marines started investigating the ship and Jonathan noticed odd things for a 'ghost ship' such as the tea being set out and the books being well kept. Then a marine informs him of treasure that they had found on board. A south bird makes its eerie noise to which Jonathan tells people to calm down as it is just a silly looking bird, to which the bird attacks him and flies away. He told his men to keep up the good work and to continue investigating the 'ghost ship'.\nJonathan, walking with other higher ranked marines, begins to connect the dots about the coffee flavor and color being similar to Jaya coffee, the gold on the ship and the legend of a gold city on Jaya, along with the South Bird saying that its not a ghost ship and that the other men were 'too green' to deal with the situation so he kept up the ghost ship idea. Drake offered to start a searching party which Jonathan immediately shuts down and says to begin searching at first light and warned them to check everyone as they could camouflage themselves to look like marines.\nChopper is shown hiding behind a tree wondering where everyone is. Zoro surfaces in the water and dodges an oncoming ship, while Nami is shown hiding her waver in a field of tall grass. Sanji, hiding in a tree, hopes that Nami and Robin are okay when a patrolling marine shoots at him, claiming he saw a light. As they walk away Sanji got mad saying he can't even smoke in peace to himself. Luffy is seen trying to pick a passage that will lead him to meat wishing he had Chopper with him to smell it for him. Usopp and Robin are shown together as Usopp finds his googles. Robin uses her Devil Fruit to spy on the marines who are talking about the ship being a ghost ship and how the gold must be cursed.\nJonathan, reclining in his office, is seen thinking about who is on board and what jobs they have.\nChopper, to get away from Marines, throws trash out a window to distract them. Nami is wondering where they landed and Robin tells Usopp the main priority is to find out how to escape. Luffy is then shown literally shadowing a marine while Sanji thinks about how stupid he is being and how he never takes things seriously.\nTo end Jonathan is shown wondering why the Straw Hats are at the base and that he will just have to wait and see.",

With the Straw Hat Pirates being low on food supplies, they are all starving, wondering if they are going to starve to death. A huge fog appears, which Nami believes can be used to their advantage to escape from the Marines. The Marine ships starts crashing into each other as they are hitting the barely visible rocks on the surface which just appeared after the fog. Chief Petty Officer Minchey orders his men to turn back because of the danger for the Marines. As the Straw Hat Pirates pass the thick fog and the rocks they see an uncharted island, hoping to find food on it. An old man is sighted with his binocular, counting the Straw Hat Pirates as six humans and an animal.\nAs the Straw Hat Pirates walk up from the shore, they spot a young goat, directly clarifying it as food. As they try to hunt it down, Nami stops them, stating that it shouldn't be eaten. Suddenly, a mob of angry full-grown goats have surrounded the Straw Hat Pirates. When the goats start attacking, Zoro brings out his sword, indicating that he will kill them but Chopper tells him not to due to the fact that they aren't bad, thanks to his ability to speak with animals. Chopper is trying to reason with the goats and finds out that someone ordered the goats to attack. Suddenly, an old man falls out of a tree pointing out the now transformed Chopper as a monster. They found out that this is the man who ordered the goats to attack.\nThe old man passes out, from the fear of being cut by Zoro's blade as he is trying to free him from the branches that he has gotten stuck in. They take him to his shed, where Chopper is getting him treated. As the old man is craving them to repay him for what they have done, Luffy finally says to help him out. On Zoro's hunt for food he finds a strange pirate ship, which he later in the evening tells the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates about after he returned with fruits as food. They all go to the ship to investigate it further. Nami states that he was once a pirate who is trying to escape the island with that pirate ship, which is more of a wreck than a ship. She also believes he has a hidden treasure somewhere on the island.\nMeanwhile, at Marine Captain Moore's base, Captain Moore tells Minchey to organize a landing party and to locate and eliminate the Straw Hat Pirates. On the island, Chopper find out that the old man has less than three days to live, due to a disease. Therefore, the next day, Sanji is making him a big dinner because of the few days he has left so that he can enjoy his last moments. At the Marine Base, they find out that the old man's name is Zenny and that he was washed ashore on the island 20 years ago with his believed huge treasure.",

Usopp is enraged by this, which prompts Luffy to clarify that it is impossible to repair the Merry with the damage she has sustained. Usopp refuses to accept this and thinks that Luffy has abandoned the Merry. The two get into a fight which eventually prompts Usopp to leave the crew. This was not only due to the current situation, but a culmination of Usopp's insecurity that he was too weak to be a part of the Straw Hat Pirates. This ends with Usopp challenging Luffy to a duel for the rights to the Merry.\nLater that night, Nami tries to dissuade Luffy from fighting with Usopp. This is unsuccessful and Luffy still wishes to fight Usopp. Chopper tries to heal Usopp, but he also refuses.

Luffy and Nami refuse to accept it but they are informed that the \"keel\" of the ship has been damaged too bad to be repaired. (The keel is the bottom part of the boat; it holds the boat together and is basically its backbone.) Luffy and Nami ask if they can build an exact replica, but the carpenters say it's impossible because of the differences in wood type and material across islands. They will need an entirely new ship.\nGovernment officials show up to talk to Iceberg while Nami and Luffy hide. While carrying the suitcases Luffy realizes two are lighter. They open them up and see that 200 million beri is gone. Luffy swears to find the money and runs off in an unknown direction. Nami meanwhile asks where the Franky hideout is and heads in that direction.\nOne the way to the Franky hideout, Nami finds Usopp. It appears he has been beaten up and left on the sidewalk. He cries that he is the one responsible for letting the money slip away and is worried about facing the crew after screwing up. Nami tells him the hideout isn't far away and tells him to stay put. She has to return the money to the Merry first before getting Usopp help. The scene cuts to the Franky family celebrating such a big heist. As they celebrate the door blows up, and behind it is Usopp with his sling shot.",

The chopped wood is then being passed on by goats to each other towards Chopper. While carrying the chopped wood, Zenny makes exclamations about the slow work of the Straw Hat crew. To calm him, Nami makes Zenny sit on a chair and Robin offers a shoulder massage. Sanji asks him about why the ship is on the top of the mountain to which he says that this ship is his coffin. The Straw Hats are astonished and ask him if it is too early to have a coffin. He replies by saying he will be needing a coffin anyway eventually. Sanji asks him why his coffin is a pirate ship and Zenny starts dozing off, but the Straw Hat Pirates think that he has died and start shouting to which Nami points them to be quiet as he is only dozing off.\nAt a Marine base, Marines learn that both the Straw Hats and Zenny are at the same island. Keeping in mind the bounties of Luffy and Zoro, Sergeant Minchey suggests a plan to assure victory.\nAt the island, Zenny is playing chess with Nami and he is getting all the services from massages to delicious cheese. Luffy, Usopp, and Zoro return with caught fish for dinner and assure Zenny of any services he asks for. Zenny exclaims how he is living a paradise. Zoro thinks about it and says that he should have died by now as three days have already passed. The Straw Hats think of leaving the island as Zenny seems in better health than when they arrived.\nNami keeps on losing to Zenny in chess and in the hope of getting details about the treasure, she bets everything including the ship. Consequently, they owe him service for 10 more years to get their ship back. Usopp suggests bolting out but Luffy refuses, saying a bet is a promise and he will not break any promises. During all the ruckus going on about leaving, Robin checkmates Zenny and wins the ship back. Being delighted on meeting such joyful prates, Zenny decides to have a party.\nAt the party, Nami tries to get the old man drunk to learn about the true location of the treasure to which he jokes about the goats being his real treasure. Later, he says he was a money lender to pirates and was known as the money lender Zenny. This revelation came as a surprise to Usopp as pirates don't usually return the money they take. He talks about how the pirates were not returning the loaned money, so he always went face to face with them to get his money back.\nRecalling his past, Zenny was on a ship and was asking for his money back or else he would sink the ship by bombing it.\nAfter talking about his past, he talks about his dream of becoming the Pirate King and how his ship got destroyed by pirates 20 years ago causing him to drift to this island. He thought of building a ship but wasn't able to bring the wood beside the sea, so he built his ship on the mountains. By the time he had completed the ship, he had gotten too old to sail the Grand Line. However, Luffy suggests that no one is too old to become the Pirate King.\nThe Marines are on their way and are thinking of luring the Straw Hat Pirates out of the island while Zenny is thinking about what Luffy said to him.\nWhen morning comes, Chopper exclaims about seeing the Marine ship and the Straw Hats start running to the shore and are confronted by Sergeant Minchey. He says he came with only one ship just to inspect the island and Zenny and the Straw Hat Pirates should leave immediately as other Marines might come for them. In reality, a huge Marine fleet is hiding in the fog behind them so that they can attack the pirates when they leave. The Straw Hats easily look through this trick and get ready to attack but are stopped as Usopp is captured and are asked to drop their weapons.

        "long_summary": "As Rebecca lies on the ground sobbing, a bewildered Luffy asks about her sudden breakdown. She then explains to him that her friend, the one-legged soldier Luffy met outside the Colosseum, will soon die. A perplexed Luffy finds such shocking news very strange, though finds that the fact that the toy is alive in the first place is even stranger. Rebecca tells him that Luffy, just as every other newcomer to Dressrosa, cannot fully understand. She proceeds to explain how toys in the country are treated the same as people, capable of befriending the friendless, becoming brothers to those without brothers, and becoming lovers to the loveless. She does note the fact that toys and humans are not allowed to live amongst one another, which she finds confusing. Ever since her mother Scarlett died 10 years ago, \"Mr. Soldier\" out of grief and kindness began to raise Rebecca as his own. Gatz then announces that the arena has been fixed, while the other gladiator prisoners tell Rebecca that the upcoming D block battle royale will soon begin. Rebecca then notices Luffy eating his spilled food off of the ground. He explains that although he spilled his food in the scuffle earlier, he eats it anyway as an apology to Rebecca for having to pay for his food, calling it delicious. Gatz then mentions how the D block battle is full of veterans, and as Rebecca proceeds to enter the arena she tells Luffy that she will meet him in the final match.\nAs she enters the arena, Rebecca recalls living with her mother as a young girl, specifically a day where she helped her mother sell some flowers and afterwards shared a meal together. She then recalls how the king's palace was ravaged and burned down as she and her mother fled from a younger Diamante and some other members of the Donquixote Pirates. Fortunately, they managed to escape their attackers, finding a place of refuge in some nearby woodlands.\nAfter a while, Scarlett decides to gather food for the both of them, leaving Rebecca behind, though promising to return shortly. Days later, Rebecca hears movement in the bushes, discovering a battered and bruised Thunder Soldier with a bloodied Scarlett in his arms, shocking Rebecca. The Thunder Soldier explains how Scarlett was attacked, and although he tried to protect her, she was ultimately killed. The Thunder Soldier gives Rebecca some food, though she instead begins to cry. The bewildered Thunder Soldier initially does not know what to do, though immediately clamps his hand on her mouth to keep her quiet as Doflamingo's troops storm by, looking for Rebecca. Later on, the Thunder Soldier tells Rebecca that her mother was an important person, and as her daughter, she is also just as important, which is why Doflamingo is after her. He then tells her that since he could not protect her mother, he will protect her, even at the cost of his life. Rebecca is not concerned with herself though, fixated on the death of her mother. She begins to sob for her mother as the Thunder Soldier attempts to cheer her up, all while trying to run back to her old home. The Thunder Soldier, however, realizes that her home has been occupied by Doflamingo's troops by now. Back at the village, Donquixote Doflamingo is shown as the new king, having usurped the throne from the previous Riku family, who had governed for centuries before their usurpation. It is also revealed that in the most recent years, the previous regime of Dressrosa was hated by its subjects for increasingly high taxation. Doflamingo promised to destroy the old ways and bring wealth back to the country.\nThe Thunder Soldier then tries to take care of Rebecca who resists at first, but over time comes to accept him. He then finds a place for Rebecca to live and tells her that although he cannot live with her, he will always be there beside her. To prove his statement, he will always drop one flower petal every morning from the window into her bedroom. Over the years, the two are very happy together, until Rebecca is kidnapped, forcing the Thunder Soldier to attack her kidnappers and retrieve her. In the process, he becomes a wanted man. The two then find another place to live and Rebecca promises to one day live in the same house as him. Deciding that Rebecca should learn how to fight and protect herself from danger, the toy begins to teach her how to defend herself.\nThe flashback ends with Rebecca stepping into the ring, thinking about how the soldier always protected her. Gatz then announces her arrival as people jeer and scream at her. Rebecca then hopes for the future and well being of the Thunder Soldier, promising that she will not lose.\nLuffy is angered and says that she is a nice person. One of the prisoners replies that everyone despises her because of her grandfather, the former King who destroyed the country many years ago.",

Meanwhile, Masira and his crew appear to salvage the ship and think the Straw Hat Pirates are trying to steal their salvage. Nami thinks that it would be easier for them if Masira's salvage crew salvages the ship for them. Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro continue to search the ship for clues while the salvage crew works to bring up the wreck. Eventually a giant sea turtle appears and eats the entire wreckage with everyone inside.",
        "long_summary": "The Straw Hat Pirates notice some debris falling from the sky, initially thinking it was rain. Suddenly, an entire wrecked ship falls from the sky causing huge waves rocking the Going Merry after almost hitting it. When the seas have calmed down the Crew tries to figure out how a ship could fall from the sky. Nami then notices that her log pose is pointing towards the sky, thinking that it is broken. Robin suggests that the log pose isn't broken but is merely registering an island with strong magnetic pull further suggesting that it must be pointing towards Sky Island.\nThe Straw Hats are both in disbelief and excitement. Robin explains that Sky Island isn't exactly just an island in a sky, but rather, an entire ocean. Luffy tells them to set their course towards Sky Island but Sanji points out that they can't actually fly. Robin goes on to admit that her knowledge about the island is based solely on word of mouth and that she has never actually seen it. Nami thinks that the whole thing is made up and insists that their log pose is simply broken. Robin then argues that instead of trying to fix something that isn't broken, they should try to find a way to get to Sky Island. She further says that in the Grand Line, one must not doubt their log pose no matter how crazy things get, stating that this is the most steadfast, unbreakable rule in the Grand Line.\nRobin proceeds to study the skull of one of the sailors from the ship that just fell from the sky while Luffy and Usopp investigate the wreckage. After piecing together the skull, Robin sees that it has been punctured from an ancient medical procedure called craterization and deduces that the man must have been dead for at least 200 years. She further deduces that the ship must be St. Briss, an exploration ship from the South Blue.\nMeanwhile, as the ship is sinking, Luffy starts drowning. After being pulled up, he announces that he found a map of Skypiea within the wreckage. Nami inspects the map and remains skeptical since it could be a fake treasure map, further pointing out that even if it were real, the map doesn't show them how to get to the Sky Island. In order to get more information on how to get to Sky Island, Nami proposes that they salvage the ship that has now sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy volunteer to go, using special barrels attached to the Merry designed by Usopp which allows them to breathe underwater.\nWhile the trio is descending towards the shipwreck, a pirate ship arrives to where the ship has sunk. The captain of the ship introduces himself as Masira, Captain of the Masira Pirates and declares that the sunken ship is now the property of the King of All Salvagers. He orders his crew to raise the ship. Masira notices the presence of the Straw Hats and warns them about stealing \"his ship\" since, according to him, all ships that sink in the area are his property. The Straw Hats decide not to tell Masira that they have already sent a team to the shipwreck and also decide not to stop him from raising the ship. Nami uses her charms to avoid suspicion from Masira and he starts to try to impress her.\nAs Masira's crew is setting the cradle to raise the sunken ship, they ascend beaten up and unable to talk. However, Masira still does not suspect The Straw Hats. Underwater, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji have made it to the wreckage and start to explore, during which time, Masira is able to set the cradle and starts raising the ship. The St. Briss starts to fill up with air and ascends but the Masira Pirates start to encounter problems caused by Luffy's group. Masira decides to investigate this himself and swims under. He finds the trio inside and asks them what they were doing in his territory. Instead of answering, Luffy simply states that he (Masira) looks like a monkey, which Masira takes as a compliment thereby losing aggression towards the group. While they are exchanging pleasantries, a gigantic turtle suddenly eats the St. Briss and surfaces beside the Going Merry.",

Luffy confirms this and tells them his name. A bifurcation is in their way and Nami tells everyone to follow her, but Luffy goes the other way, as he was watching his brother fight. The Straw Hats arrive at the ship and carry all the supplies, only to notice that Luffy is missing. Luffy is sitting on the barrel he was carrying in an alley, but he does not know where his crew went. Ace greets him from the top of a house in the alley and then comes down. They start arm wrestling on top of the barrel Luffy was sitting on, but after struggling, the barrel breaks and the water inside it scatters. They both agree that they are equally strong. Ace invites Luffy and his crew to join the Whitebeard Pirates, but Luffy declines.\nOn Smoker's ship, Mr. 11 is left alone, tied to the mast. Some Billions get on the deck and Mr. 11 asks them to untie him. They explain that as Billions, they are candidates to be promoted to Officer Agents. Mr. 11 asks them to untie him again, but they shoot him. The Billions get off the ship and someone informs them that Fire Fist Ace is in the town. One of them then comments that if they take down Ace, they will surely be promoted to Officer Agents.\nLuffy and Ace start searching for Luffy's crew, but as they walk, Billions start to surround them without being noticed. After they are gathered, everyone comes out. Luffy and Ace do not care what they say and keep walking but the Billions start a fight. After Luffy sends the leader flying with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, one of the Billions tells his comrades not to be scared by that, and everyone keeps chasing them again. Luffy spots his ship and stretches his arms in order to reach for it. He enters the ship ramming towards Sanji and Chopper. Ace reaches the ship in his boat, but then they spot five Billions ships coming towards them. Ace tells Luffy that he can handle them, gets in his boat, and starts propelling it with the help of his flames. He then jumps over a ship and when he lands, he launches a Hiken, destroying the five ships consecutively.\nSmoker is talking to Tashigi and asks what Nefertari Vivi was doing with the Straw Hats. Tashigi proposes that perhaps she was a hostage to a major scheme, but Smoker does not think so. He thinks that is unlikely since she was getting along with the group as if she was one of them. He says that something big is going to occur and that he may know where they are heading after Luffy told him he only wanted to beat Crocodile. Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper in the Going Merry are toasting for Ace joining the Straw Hats, but Ace tells them he is not joining them. After that, he explains that he is in search for Blackbeard after he killed one of his crewmates. He also explains that he is heading to Yuba, and Nami tells him that they are going to the same place. Vivi proceeds to explain the route and after that, they toast for having a fun time together.",

He catches the attention of everyone in the place and a lot of people start to call out his name, including Puppu, who recognizes him as one of the Shichibukai. Crocodile says he just came to get the head of Puppu, but the pirates tell him to not underestimate them. Puppu tells him that he sold himself to authority and that he is the World Government's dog. As he gets down from the building, Crocodile says that anyone who does not wish to die should lay on the ground. When Crocodile lands on the ground, Puppu and his crew stab him, however, they are unable withdraw their swords. Crocodile raises his arm, and an upside-down twister starts to form. After the twister dissipates, the pirates are seen dead, covered in sand and dehydrated.

        "short_summary": "Robin continues her search while the New Fish-Man Pirates begin to take over. People are also seen being forced to step on a photo, and if they do not, they are considered as enemies. On the other hand, Jinbe and Nami are having a serious conversation about Arlong. Nami then has flashbacks of her past and how Arlong messed up her life. Afterwards, Hatchi explained to Nami how when they were just children they dreamed of the land where humans lived, but was in return rejected. Jinbe talks about how the relationship between fish-men and humans stayed the same, even over 200 years, and the two people that rose to power to change history were Queen Otohime and Fisher Tiger. But for the two of them, what was their hidden angst?",
        "long_summary": "Robin is seen walking through the Sea Forest and eventually finds what she was looking for. Meanwhile, Neptune's army escapes the palace and the Ministers lament on how this has turned out. The Minister of the Right tells the soldiers to look for the princes and then they'll come back to reclaim the palace. While this is going on, the New Fish-Man Pirates are forcing the citizens of Fish-Man Island to step on a Fumi-e of Otohime's face as loyalty. As Dosun is forcing the citizens to do this, Fukaboshi arrives and punches him in the face in anger for forcing the citizens to step the on the Fumi-e of his late mother's face.\nAt the graveyard, Jinbe reassures Shirahoshi that her father will be saved. Sanji is serving tea to the girls and Nami tells him to settle down as she's trying to have a conversation with Jinbe and wants to know if he really did send Arlong to the East Blue. Sanji also wants to know as he remembers Jinbe's name from what Yosaku mentioned two years ago and from reading the paper involving Luffy working together with Jinbe. He goes on to state how hard Nami has had it with Arlong for eight long years and claims what he says next will decide if he forgives him or not. Jinbe is left shocked by hearing this and Hachi states it's all true, while Nami reminisces her time with Arlong's gang. Nami states that no matter what, she will never forgive Arlong for what he did and notes that from two years ago on Sabaody, she never imagined that Fish-Men would ever be captured and noticed that Sabaody Park is identical to Arlong Park in design. Hachi states that Arlong always hated humans, but as a child, along with Hachi and the others, desired to be a part of the Human world. He states that 200 years ago was when the World Government made a truce with Fish-Men and the king was later able to attend the council of kings. However, mankind still hated fish-men.\nDen talks about how the Great Pirate Era caused great trouble on the island and Jinbe states how that was ended thanks to the late Whitebeard. Jinbe talks about how those in the government with power are the ones who are the worst in discrimination, such as the World Nobles. He states that two people on the island attempted to make a change for Fish-Men: the hero of slaves, Fisher Tiger, and the late queen, Otohime. While Luffy cannot remember Tiger completely from his talk with Hancock, Jinbe states it was because of these two that changed the history of the island.",

At first, Apis believes that the Dragon's Nest was located on this island, but upon further inspection of the ceiling paintings, Nami deduces that the Dragon's Nest was located back at Warship Island, but sank into the sea. They are convinced that the island was actually the royal court mentioned in Bokuden's story.\nApis asks Ryu where the Dragon's Nest was. After watching a flock of birds flying in the building, Ryu finally remembers that the Dragon's Nest was indeed located east of the summit at Warship Island.\nEric appears. It is revealed he had been listening to the Straw Hat Pirates' conversation and now knows where the Dragon's Nest is. Luffy attempts to break out of the building, successfully breaking a hole into the wall. However, Eric leaps into the building and fights Zoro, while the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates, along with Ryu and Apis, escape and ride on Ryu's cart.\nAfter battling Zoro, Eric flees the building to chase Ryu. Zoro chases Eric.\nEric tries to leap off a building onto the cart, but is struck on the legs with a stick that Zoro threw. Eric finally agrees to battle Zoro. Meanwhile, the cart finally lands near the Going Merry. Luffy extends his arm, grabs Zoro, and pulls him to the ship. They set sail as Eric swears that he will not let the Straw Hat Pirates escape.\nThe Going Merry emerges out of the invisible barrier, much to the surprise of the Marines. Eric boards the Marine ship, and Lieutenant Commander Hardy commands the fleet to chase after the Going Merry.\nThe Straw Hat Pirates continue to sail towards Warship Island, only to be caught by Nelson Royale and his fleet. Nelson commands his ships to fan out, connecting the ships with chains and making an impenetrable barrier to block the Going Merry. So, the Straw Hat Pirates decide to board the ships, kick the Marines out, and cut the chains.",

Oden asked Whitebeard to let him join his crew, but he refuses, stating that he was not a loyal person and would therefore not be good at serving someone else. Kin'emon was also opposed to Oden setting sail because he had his duties as a daimyo.\nTwo weeks passed and Whitebeard's men finished repairing his ship, the Moby Dick. Whitebeard decided to set sail at night to prevent Oden from joining, but Oden snuck out and nevertheless attempted to board the ship. He held onto a chain tied to the ship's mast and was carried along with the ship. Izou pursued Oden and held onto him, trying to prevent him from settting sail.\nMarco rescued Izou from the water and carried him onboard. Oden, however, was not rescued and was dragged through the rough waters, crashing into rocks along the way. Whitebeard promised Oden that he would be allowed into the crew if he held onto the chain for three days. Oden accepted the challenge as he rode down the waterfall, got eaten by a fish, and was dragged through icy waters.\nThree days passed and one hour remained. Oden held onto the chain strongly but his body was greatly swollen from water collision. However, he heard the screams of a woman being harassed on a nearby island, Amatsuki Toki. Oden let go of the chain, swam to the island and scared off the miscreants.",

He is seen saying that some of the Fake Straw Hat Pirates and the Caribou pirates managed to get away because Rayleigh was blocking their way. He adds that two Pacifistas were severely damaged by the real Straw Hats mentioning that one of the Pacifistas fought against the Straw Hats two years ago.

While Chopper and Usopp were yelling at Luffy and Zoro for their bad behavior, Sanji asks Nami how Rayleigh's ship coating works. Nami happily tells him, saying that Rayleigh had given her notes. She turns around and reveals her boobs to Sanji, causing him to suffer a massive nosebleed and fly out of the ship's coating. Robin comments how the coating hasn't broken despite being pierced at such deep pressure. Luffy stretches his arm to grab Sanji back into the ship, combatting the effects of the water on since since he is a devil fruit user. Usopp comments on how Sanji was more more perverted while Brook comments that Sanji might have died, seeing the mermaids on Fish-Man Island as he dreamt to see. Nami later continues her explanation of the coating. The coating is able to handle one pierce but unable to handle multiple. Luffy and Zoro later resume to catching fish, the latter challenging to former on who could catch the most fish. Chopper and Usopp beat up the two again with Usopp scolding the two of not listening to what Nami said. Franky later tells his crew that upon his arrival he saw Bartholomew Kuma protecting the Thousand Sunny.

First, Luffy thinks it is Zoro, but it is actually a warrior using sabers with scars all over his body, Jigoro. This warrior declares Luffy his enemy and desires to kill the captain. Franky begins to have trouble when Robin swings to rescue her friend and they run along a catwalk. The cyborg then blows a Fresh Fire, and the zombies drench themselves with water. The archeologist uses an Once Fleurs and Slam to try and stall the zombies. As they race to the outside, they begin to learn that Luffy had gone missing. Luffy is also trapped in a casket and ferried to another part of the castle. A spider-monkey-like zombie then appears blocking the way. The two begin to feel outnumbered.",

        "long_summary": "Crocus begins to tell the story of Laboon to the Straw Hat Pirates. He explains that Laboon has been waiting for a group of pirates for over fifty years. Fifty years ago, Laboon came along with a group of pirates known as the Rumbar Pirates. The pirates did not wish to bring the young whale in their dangerous journey and wanted to leave it in West Blue, where it originally inhabited but it had followed the pirates on their journey. To Laboon, the pirates were like its own family. The Rumbar Pirates stayed in the Reverse Mountain for a few months to repair their ship, during which Crocus became friends with them. Once they were ready to leave on their journey, they asked Crocus to look after Laboon and left him in the care of Crocus promising to return back after three years. The captain of the ship asked Laboon to wait for them, and promised him that no matter what happens in their journey, they would come for him and he is still their friend.\nThe scene shifts back to Straw Hat Pirates. They finally understand why Laboon has been bellowing and ramming his head against the wall. Crocus reveals that he is a doctor and has been treating Laboon's wound from the inside. Luffy immediately asks him to become the doctor of his crew to which Crocus declines reasoning that he is no longer as young as he used to be. Crocus finally let them out of Laboon through a tunnel and the Straw Hat Pirates briefly discuss on the possibility of the Rumbar Pirates death. Usopp declines on the possibility of their death and believes that they are indeed alive and will come back for Laboon. Crocus however says that the pirates possibly ran away from Grand Line and will not be returning back for Laboon. The Straw Hat Pirates further discuss that the pirates running away and not fulfilling their promise of coming back for Laboon, and question Crocus why he did not tell Laboon about the pirates' betrayal, as he is perfectly capable of understanding human speech. Crocus tells them that he indeed tried but the whale refused to listen to him. Sanji tells him that since Crocus himself got betrayed, Laboon should not be his problem anymore but Crocus tells him that he is not going to let the whale die as he has forged a certain relationship with it.\nSuddenly, Luffy breaks the mast off Going Merry and strikes the whale with it. Laboon retaliates and begins fighting with Luffy. Luffy stops the whale and declares that it is a draw between them. Luffy labels Laboon as his rival and promises to have a rematch with him after they had completed their journey. He then asks Laboon to wait for him and not to heal himself as they will be fighting soon. Luffy then paints a Jolly Roger on Laboon's face.\nMiss Wednesday and Mr. 9 escape from the Straw Hat Pirates' ship but they drop their Log Pose, which Luffy picks up. They decide to return back to their boss as the time limit to their mission was over. Suddenly, Mr. 13 and Miss Friday, the Unluckies fly over them and drop a bomb on them.\nNami discovers that the usual compass and common sense does not work on Grand Line because of the magnetic fields of various minerals found on Grand Line. Crocus says that they need to have a Log Pose in order to advance on their adventure. Luffy reveals that he found a Log Pose on the ship. Crocus then tells them that Log Pose readapts to the magnetic field of the various islands and will point them in the right direction, which when followed eventually leads to Laugh Tale. Usopp questions if the One Piece is there, to which Crocus replies that only one man and his crew has ever reached there, the Pirate King Gol D. Roger and mentions that One Piece is a myth and no one really knows if it exists or not. Luffy reveals that they will know for sure when they reach there, so it does not really matter. While they are conversing, Luffy eats all the food and Sanji kicks him for not saving any for others. The Log Pose suddenly breaks and Nami kicks both. Crocus says that he would give his Log Pose for saving Laboon. Later, Laboon brings out Sanji, Luffy, Mr.9 and Miss Wednesday out of the sea. Mr.9 and Miss Wednesday requests to go on a journey with the Straw Hat Crew to Whisky Peak, their homeland. Crocus tells the crew to leave them be for trying to hurt Laboon but Luffy agrees to take them to their hometown. The crew then continue on their journey to Whisky Peak and the episode ends with Crocus saying goodbye to the Straw Hat Crew and remembering Gol D. Roger.",

Rayleigh takes Luffy to an abandoned island called Rusukaina to begin his training. While Rayleigh and Luffy are going into the Jungle of the island he shows Luffy the only safe spot there, afterwards they go a bit further and are attacked by a huge elephant. Rayleigh introduces Luffy to the concept of Haki and then demonstrates the three different types of Haki. Luffy sets down his straw hat in the only safe area on the island and begins his training with Rayleigh.",
        "long_summary": "This episode starts on the Kuja Pirates' ship. Jinbe is leaving and he and Luffy are saying their farewells. Shortly after Jinbe leaves, Hancock fantasizes about Luffy again.\nThe scene switches to a deserted island north west of the Amazon Lily called Rusukaina, which will be Luffy's training spot for the next two years. Rayleigh mentions it is a great spot for training because the island has forty-eight seasons in a year and the season changes weekly. Hancock tells Luffy that she will bring him food everyday from Amazon Lily. Rayleigh interrupts her and says that while Luffy is training, women are not allowed on the island. Hancock gets mad about this, but Rayleigh tells her that it is good for Luffy, so Hancock and the Kuja Pirates leave.\nThe scene changes to Rayleigh and Luffy taking a look around the island. Rayleigh is saying there was a country long ago on Rusukaina, but the people lost their will to survive. Luffy is surprised by the vast wilderness and Rayleigh tells him that there are about five hundred wild beasts that surpass Luffy's strength. Rayleigh mentions there is a power that concerns Luffy and that power is called Haki.\nThen out of nowhere an elephant that is five times bigger than a normal elephant (as Luffy describes it) comes out of nowhere while Rayleigh is explaining what Haki is. Luffy panics and uses his Second Gear to try and defeat the elephant, but it does not affect the elephant as it was still standing and knocked Luffy aside. Luffy is about to try again but Rayleigh tells Luffy to watch him, explaining the first two basic types of Haki. Luffy remembers that a lot of his friends and enemies have used them before and it could work on his enemies if he learns it. Then Rayleigh explains there is one more Haki and Luffy, having a flashback, remembers that he used it before but Rayleigh warns Luffy that if this Haki is not used and managed properly it could hurt innocent people.\nThe scene switches to night with Luffy and Rayleigh having dinner and Rayleigh saying he will teach all of these Haki to Luffy the best he could in two years and Rayleigh adds that as a trainer he is not going to go easy on Luffy. Then Rayleigh says they will start training now but Luffy says he needs to do something first. Luffy goes to the only safe spot on the island and leaves his straw hat on a rock along with Rayleigh's Vivre Card and thinks about his crew and Ace and Sabo and about their promise and then starts his training with Rayleigh.\nThe episode ends with a scene of all of the crew and Luffy's pledge to become stronger.",

Usopp gets mad, asking them if they remember how they got the ship in the first place. Luffy tells Usopp not to complain and that the ship is part of the crew and that it needs to be fixed. That was before he hit a hole in the ship, making Usopp angry again. Nami looks at the map explaining that they are headed east by circling the island on their way to visit Mont Blanc Cricket. Luffy and Usopp are shocked to see a huge carnival palace looking house. However, it's revealed that the magnificent looking palace is just a cutout with a much smaller house behind it. Nami asks why he was outcast, and Robin explains that it might have something to do with him suggesting finding gold. Nami is thrilled by the idea of finding gold and puts Chopper to work by digging around. Luffy goes into the house to find no one there. Nami finds a very old children's book titled \"Noland the Liar\" from the North Blue. Usopp likes the title and Sanji reveals that he is from the North Blue but grew up in the East Blue, stating how the book is famous in the North. He also says that the book was based on a man who existed a long time ago. \nStory: 400 years ago, there lived a man named Mont Blanc Noland who lived in a North Blue country. As an explorer, he talked about his adventures even though the villagers couldn't decide whether to believe him or not. One day, he reported to the king after his travels and told him that he found a mountain of gold on an island in the middle of the sea. The king set sail to see if the story was true, taking 2,000 soldiers and Noland. After harsh waves and battling monsters, only the King, Noland, and 100 soldiers remained. But all that was on the island was a jungle. The king sentenced Noland to death for lying, with his last words being \"The mountain of gold must have sank into the sea!\", but no one believed him. \nBack at the pub, the pirates are laughing at the fact that Mont Blanc Cricket is a descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, saying that he must not be right in the head if he wants to clear his 400-year ancestors name by finding a few pieces of gold. Back with the Straw Hats, Luffy sees bubbles coming from the water, but is disappointed when nothing happens. Nami teases Usopp by saying that Noland died before he became \"a great warrior of the sea\". Luffy is suddenly dragged into the sea as a large man with little blond hair and a \"Maroon\" tattoo jumps out of the water. Sanji runs towards the mysterious fellow while telling Usopp to get Luffy out of the water. The man, who we believe to be Mont Blanc Cricket, shoots Sanji in the face, but it actually missed. Just as Zoro is about to enter the fight, the Cricket drops his pistol and falls to the ground. Usopp gets Luffy up to the surface while he explains what happened. The crew takes the man into his house while Chopper doctors him up. Chopper explains that he has Caisson Disease, which is something divers get, but it's not long-lasting, however it can become fatal if the person exerts themself too much. In the background there is a picture of the man and the two monkey pirate brothers smiling.\nThe two monkey brothers, both in good health, come bursting into the home asking if the \"old-timer\" is ok. Usopp and Chopper freak out when the brothers ask what they're doing to him, but Luffy says they are taking of care of him and that they should leave. The brothers are glad that the Straw Hats are nice. The brothers reveal that the house is the headquarters of the Saruyama Alliance. Cricket comes to and apologizes for assuming they were after the gold. Luffy asks him about Sky Island but gets laughed at instead. He explains that no one knows for sure if it's there, except for the man everyone calls a liar. Luffy keeps looking at Usopp, but he says that it's not him. It's revealed that Cricket is indeed a Mont Blanc descendant, and that Noland was actually an extremely honest person who was very sad that the people didn't believe him. Usopp guesses that he was diving to find the gold and clear his ancestors name, but he shoots at him, missing of course, and explains that what his ancestor did has nothing to do with him and because of him he had a rough childhood. But over the past 400 years, many relatives have tried to clear the Mont Blanc name but have disappeared instead. So Cricket ran away from home and became a pirate to escape Noland's reputation. He managed to get his own ship and crew and entered the grand line. However, they accidentally came across an island, which is the one they are on now. He believed that it was fate, that he, who hated the Mont Blanc name so much, would find the island his ancestor had found long ago. He decided to search for the gold, but his crew decided to leave instead of helping him search. Rather than feel obligated to find the gold, Cricket thinks of it as a duel between the man who made his life hell and himself. Usopp bawls and Luffy asks how the monkeys fit into the picture. Turns out, the monkeys love the picture book and believe the gold really exists. Luffy presses the man about sky island, yelling that he wants to go there. Cricket says that it's not confirmed that Noland ever went there but tosses Nami Noland's log book from 400 years ago. Nami reads about his adventure and how they saw skyfish. The gang gets really excited to hear Nami read about Sky Island. Cricket goes outside to see the Monkey Brothers fighting and convinces them to help the Straw Hats get to Sky Island. ",

        "short_summary": "Tashigi tries to see what happened in the fight. Luffy's group sees the flying warship. Luffy sees Law and thanks him for saving him two years ago. Law says that they aren't friends and Luffy agrees since they were both after One Piece. Law remembers the past between him and Luffy when Law saved him at Marineford. Luffy sees Smoker on the ground. Tashigi cries over Smoker's body and attempts to kill Law but he switches their hearts.\nMeanwhile, the children from the lab complain about the cold so the samurai uses his devil fruit to give the children and the Straw Hats warm clothes. Luffy's group then meets up with the other group behind the lab.  While going over what happened Robin reveals that Law became a Shichibukai two years ago and the samurai reveals that Law is the one who cut him in thirds and reunites with his legs. Law meets up with Caesar Clown who Smoker speculated was behind everything on the island.",
        "long_summary": "Smoker lies motionless in the snow. With Law leaving with the heart he extracted. The marines seize this chance to run towards Smoker.\nLuffy, Robin, Zoro and Usopp are riding on Brownbeard\u2019s back when they spot the warship, speculating that the Marines are around. Luffy calls out to someone Usopp saw in the distance, asking him if he remembers him and gives him his thanks. Zoro recalls meeting him while they were at Sabaody Archipelago and Robin identifies him as Trafalgar Law but before she can complete her sentence, Luffy interrupts and tells his crew that Law helped him escape from the battlefield and treated his wounds, saving his life. Luffy runs towards Law eagerly and thank him again, wondering where his crew mates are. Law recalls the events from two years ago and tells Luffy that he does not need to thank him and reminds him not to forget that they are both pirates. Luffy laughs and agrees that when it comes to fighting for One Piece, they are all enemies. Usopp sees a Marine soldier on the ground and seems to know who he is. The Marines run towards Smoker and Luffy seems to remember Tashigi. Tashigi reaches Smoker and notices the hole in his chest. She recalls the method Law used to gain his status and cries, shouting angrily while running towards Law. However, Law says that he doesn\u2019t like \u201clame tear-jerking scenes\u201d and uses his powers to switch the hearts between Tashigi and Smoker. Usopp urges Luffy to leave because the marines are approaching. Before leaving, Luffy tells Law that he wants to ask him something. Law\u2019s reply is for them to go to the back of the laboratory, saying that what they are looking for can be found there and they will see each other again, as they both have something they want to retrieve. However, it is revealed that the instructions are meant for Brownbeard. \nOut in the open air, at a mountain near the laboratory, the children are freezing. The samurai instructs everyone to put something on their heads. When it is done, he concentrates and shouts. Smoke surrounds them and coats magically appear on them. Everyone is amazed and the samurai explains that after eating an unusual fruit, he is able to disguise anyone in any way he sees fit. He warns them that the clothes will disappear if they are taken off. The children swarm towards him gratefully. However, Franky questions the lateness of his actions and smacks him, leading him to explain that he enjoyed the sight of seeing Nami in a breast-band, which earned him another smack from Nami herself.\nLuffy\u2019s group appear in the distance and they reunites. They seek shelter inside a building. The samurai is elated at getting his legs back while Luffy is depressed at his loss. Nami offers Sanji some cigarettes and the Straw Hats affected by Law reintroduce themselves to Luffy. They recount all the events that have happened, gaining more information from the samurai and the children to piece everything together. Luffy is surprised that Law is a Shichibukai now, something which Robin knew. When Luffy mentions that the samurai\u2019s legs were cursing about a Shichibukai, Nami questions how can it speak. The samurai explains that he spoke through his farts and it is a specialty of his.\nIn another cave, the Marines crowd around Tashigi, who is in Smoker\u2019s body, which is functioning even without his heart. Smoker mentions that a ship hidden beside the laboratory has \u2018CC\u2019 mark on it. He further explains that if it was an old ship, the initials on it should have been \u2018PH\u2019, which would stands for Punk Hazard. Smoker reveals that the person, to whom the initials \"CC\" refer to, is a former colleague of Dr. Vegapunk, a scientist by the name of Caesar Clown.\nThe gas slowly takes shape bit by bit and asks Law what has he done, to which Law replies that he should be the one complaining instead.",

His main reason for the meeting: a request to stop Ace from chasing after his former-crew mate Blackbeard. When Shanks's request is denied, the two clash, resulting in an enormous gash across the sky. Meanwhile in Water 7, the Franky Family is shocked to discover that they've been completely removed from the report on the events at Enies Lobby while the Galley-La Company helps Franky with building the Straw Hats' new ship.",
        "long_summary": "The episode starts by showing everyone at Water 7 partying. Sogeking singing, Franky Family dancing, etc. The scene changes to a fleet of destroyed Marine ships. An unharmed pirate ship proceeds past them. Meanwhile, the Five Elders are informed that the Whitebeard Pirates and the Red Hair Pirates have broke through the Marine's defenses and that the two crews are arranged to have a meeting.\nOn Whitebeard's ship, Whitebeard is informed of Shanks arrival. At Navy Headquarters, Marine soldiers are on standby after hearing the news of the meeting. Shanks boards Whitebeard's ship, as Marco orders the newcomers to go inside the ship. However, the message comes too late. Members of the Whitebeard pirates faint when Shanks walk pass them using his Supreme King Haki. Shanks apologizes, since it hard to stay calm on an enemy ship. Whitebeard orders his men to leave. When the crew is out of sight, Shanks prepared drinks of alcohol for the two captains.\nAfter a sip of the drink, Whitebeard said Shanks has made quite a leap as a pirate since Gol D. Roger's death, and asked about Buggy. Shanks replied that he hasn't heard anything about him since they parted ways at Loguetown after Roger's execution. Whitebeard was curious and asked why Shanks was missing an arm. He replied that he bet it on the new era. Shanks changed the subject to his scars, pointing to one scar across his face. Declaring it came from a member of Whitebeard's crew; Marshall D. Teach. He then asked Whitebeard to stop Ace's search for Teach. Whitebeard becomes furious, and says that Blackbeard needs to learn his lesson. He then throws his bottle at Shanks. Shanks draws his sword and said that the world will be thrown into chaos. The two clash swords, and the sky divides from the impact.\nThe next day, the Franky Family reads the newspaper on Enies Lobby, relieved that they were not mentioned. At the Galley-La Company, the Straw Hat Pirates react to the news, wondering why the Franky Family was not in the article. Sanji and Chopper are excited, as they can't wait for their new bounties. Meanwhile, Franky prepares the new ship for the Straw Hat Pirates. Iceburg arrives and offers to help, then Paulie, Tilestone, and Peepley Lulu appears and offers to help as well. Back at the Galley-La Company, Luffy learns that Franky is building a ship for them. Nami informs everyone that they still have the money to spend and recommends buying furniture for the ship. However, Nami finds only a small stack of money in the safe. Luffy told Nami that he spent the money on the party last night. After Luffy get beaten by Nami, the crew goes shopping.",

However, they are attacked by two giant centipedes, but Luffy manages to defeat them both. The team gets suspicious at Pedro's advanced knowledge of the area, and he reveals that he has been here once before.\nMeanwhile, Big Mom gets a craving for croquembouche that causes her to fall into madness, and she leaves a path of destruction in her wake as she searches for the treat. The ministers begin to panic as she enters Sweet City, and order the citizens to evacuate as Big Mom mindlessly wrecks the city.",
        "long_summary": "On Broc Coli Island, soldiers of Germa 66 enter a battle, where they easily overpower the weaker and less well equipped soldiers on the other side. As the massacre continues, one survivor attempts to avenge his wife and children by shooting one of the Germa commanders. However, the commander has one of his soldiers take the bullet from him, and confronts the man as he forces his gun against his head. The commander angrily states that the man is making him late for his brother's wedding, and shoots the man before walking away, the battle having easily been won. He then contacts his brother, who is collecting payment from the winning side for Germa's services, and the winning side celebrates Germa and their victory. However, once the two brothers reunite, they mock the two factions for taking two years to fight this war. As they overlook the destruction on the island, they contact someone to inform him that they are making the two-day voyage to Whole Cake Island. The elder brother expresses his excitement to see Sanji again, but the younger one calls him a liar.\nMeanwhile, the Sanji Retrieval Team approaches Jam Island on their way to Whole Cake Island, and despite Chopper and Carrot's wishes to eat more sweets, Nami has them steer clear of the coast in order to avoid being detected, continuing on their secret route. They then come to a purple-colored part of the ocean, and Pedro reveals that juice from a nearby island flows into it. The team wonders how he knows so much about the area, recalling how someone on Cacao Island knew him and getting suspicious. Pedro then states that he has been here before. Suddenly, the ship is rocked several times by a Giant Sea Centipede, which Pedro states will eat anything indiscriminately. The centipede surfaces and confronts the team, towering over them and the Thousand Sunny. Nami and Chopper become extremely frightened, but Luffy, Brook, Pedro, and Carrot excitedly prepare to fight it. However, Luffy manages to bring it down by himself with Gomu Gomu no Gatling, shattering its shell and sending it crashing back into the ocean. Before the team can recover, they are soon confronted by another centipede, which is bigger and stronger than the previous one, withstanding Luffy's Gatling attack. Brook, Pedro, and Carrot try to step in and slice at its chest, but Luffy ends up taking it down alone again as he kicks it in the face with Gear 2. The team sails on peacefully, although Brook, Pedro, and Carrot are not very happy with not having the chance to attack either of the centipedes. Luffy wonders if they can eat them, but Nami and Chopper quickly dissuades him.\nMeanwhile on Whole Cake Island, Big Mom rampages through the woods after she develops a craving for croquembouche. Her eyes turn red, and she fixates entirely on getting croquembouche, attacking everything that gets in her way. She approaches Sweet City with a path of destruction in her wake, and in Sweet City, her ministers panic as they desperately try to satiate her eating disorder by getting her croquembouche before she can enter the city. However, the kitchens are all very busy, and the ministers are forced to evacuate everyone from Sweet City as Big Mom enters it, destroying and eating buildings as she tries to fill her craving. A talking cloud and talking sun try to talk her out of it, but she throws them aside as her destruction continues. While the citizens evacuate, one person keeps them moving, desperately wondering where the croquembouche is. However, the ministers can only wait in fear for it to come as Big Mom climbs up a large building, destroying it and sending the citizens fleeing in terror.",

Hancock goes to take a bath, and some of the villagers discuss a legend that states that Hancock and her sisters defeated a Gorgon, but received eyes that turn anyone who looks at them to stone.

The Gorgon Sisters lead their troupe off the ship. Sandersonia and Marigold are surprised that the Kuja missed their leader for so long.\nAs a Monkey Carriage is prepared, Hancock believes everything on the island is sign. The Kuja look over their haul while Ran's gift is heading for the castle. She meets with Granny Nyon and had procured a newspaper from a government ship.\nAt the castle, Hancock walks through pleased to be home. She receives a ring, but then throws it away thinking it will spoil her image. Enishida also presents a statue of her master. She feels the statue, but shatters it as it was made from mud and clay. Hancock also learns the defenders were absent, because they were chasing a wild beast racing through the jungle.\nLuffy flies through the jungle and Kikyo fires another arrow at him. Sweet Pea thinks they got him, but the pirate was snagged away by a fish.\nHancock sits on her makeshift snake throne and asks for sake. Nyon walks in and demands an audience but forgot \"please\". Nyon tells of how a central government ship had arrived and want her presence lest she loses her title. However, Hancock is afraid. Without her title, Amazon Lily will be at the mercy of other pirates and the government.\nWhile Nyon is old, she shows Hancock a crystal ball thinking of her future. The Snake Princess then sees her fortune; She is to leave immediately. Angered, Hancock has Nyon thrown out as her reign as Gloriosa was scuppered years ago. At first, Hancock seems to agree with the Government terms, but doesn't and tosses Nyon out the window. She then demands the glass be cleared out.\nNyon lands in a courtyard, but is shown to still be a feisty Kuja. Hancock then announces she needs to bathe. This also interrupts the Kuja's daily lifestyle. As Hancock is bathing, no one is to go inside the castle. One of the Kuja, Ran meets with the eight year old girl and tells of the Gorgon Sister' secret.\nHancock strips naked while Ran tells her story. The Gorgon was a horrifying monster. If anyone gazed on it, they would become statues. Just then, Hancock and her sisters killed the monster. As it died, the monster's death cursed the sisters with monstrous eyes that will petrify and kill anyone who looks upon them. That's why ordinary people must not dare glare at them leaving the castle under heavy guard.\nHancock bathes while the fish carries Luffy around and tosses him further into the jungle. He spots a group of snakes and screams, attracting the Kuja warriors to his location. He runs up the rock wall, knocking the snakes off him. Luffy makes it back to town and ponders his next move.\nHe learns the Kuja have a pirate ship and hopes to borrow it. Without Nami, he hopes to ask for a ride in their ship back to Sabaody. He decides to ask someone in a large building thinking of important people. As the Kuja defenders race back, Luffy breaks part of the castle, and lands in bathwater. As it is shallow, Luffy seems safe, but then sees Hancock, naked in the bath as well. He spots something on her back, with the Snake Princess angered.",

The Straw Hat group begins to beat them up and begin to check Dr. Hogback's home. A person carrying a torch approaches the beaten zombies.\nWhile walking through the forest, Zoro and Sanji get into another argument when another zombie comes in awe of their power. This zombie informs the group of a major threat who stole the zombie shadows, Gecko Moria the most terrifying on the island. This catches Robin's ears as his bounty's much higher than Luffy's and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. The old zombie also warns that Gecko Moria will also be after the Straw Hat Pirate's shadows and when the sunlight hits them, they will be vaporized. Luffy picks up his lantern and accepts the challenge. Just then, more zombies without shadows appear to encourage the group.\nMeanwhile, Ryuma knocks Nami, Usopp and Chopper into Dr. Hogback's lab, surprising and angering the scientist.

The ghosts creeping through the forest gather to Kumacy and a girl's chambers, forming Perona up.\nAs more zombies race to inform Moria, one of the short zombies Nin wakes their boss up. The three little zombies tell of the Straw Hat's progress thus far. Luffy and his party spot rain pouring down and they spot a pirate sail. The old zombie then warns that Thriller Bark has a sail and is actually a very large pirate ship. The back of the mast is also the home of Gecko Moria.

        "long_summary": "In the main square of Water 7, Zoro is still seen running across the rooftops but finds himself to be lost. Somewhere else, Luffy can be seen trying to free himself after getting stuck between some walls yet again. Zoro spots the burning building and runs toward it but ends up getting blown down by the wind. Meanwhile, Kokoro can be seen watching the fire from afar.\nBack to eight years ago, Iceburg is still yelling at Franky saying he will never forgive him. Suddenly, Tom speaks up telling Iceburg not to blame Franky as he didn't do this. Franky runs over to Tom and notices a harpoon stuck in him saying that it's one of his special harpoons that is difficult to pull out once it gets stuck in. Franky apologizes to Tom but Tom says not to as it's not a problem to him. Soon, the people of Water 7 spot Tom, Iceburg, and Franky but are shocked to see that they're the ones injured as they think that Tom is the reason for the attack. Spandam with his CP5 agents appear behind them and Spandam says it's the time where all of them come quietly.\nIn town, Tom, Iceburg, and Franky are all handcuffed while Spandam explains that they are the ones that attacked the Judicial Ship and he and his CP5 agents managed to stop it in time. Some people wondered why Tom would do that as the judge would've acquitted his last offensive for building the Oro Jackson for Gold Roger thanks to him building the Sea Train Puffing Tom. Spandam walks up to Jorge where the two shake hands with the latter thanking Spandam for stopping the attack. Spandam says he'll take over the investigation and thinks to himself saying he's close to getting the blueprints for Pluton. Kokoro and Yokozuna are worried for Tom and the others.\nJorge then speaks up thanking Tom for building the Sea Train stating that Water 7 will continue to build but asks why Tom would attack the Judicial Ship. Franky speaks up saying it wasn't Tom but Spandam. However, the people all start laughing thinking that someone from the World Government wouldn't do something like that. Spandam then speaks up saying that the raid ships were created by Franky himself. Franky says that ships that do such a horrible thing aren't his ships anymore. Angry at his comments, Tom breaks free of his handcuffs and punches Franky much to the shock of everyone. Tom tells Franky that when a ship is built, no matter what type, it's neither good nor evil. He continues saying even if the ships hurt someone or could even destroy the world, the one who created them should never deny making them and never place the blame on the ships. Everyone, including Jorge and Spandam, stare in shock at Tom's comments and Tom tells Iceburg and Franky that whatever happens, not to interfere. Tom then violently punches Spandam causing horror to everyone. Tom continues to attack Spandam but Spandam orders the Marines and CP5 to shoot at Tom. Tom kneels down from the pain with Franky worried for him.\nSpandam is pleased that Tom has been shot while Franky wonders why Tom did that. Spandam then orders his CP5 agents to arrest Tom, Iceburg, and Franky saying they'll be going to Enies Lobby. The people are shocked saying they didn't know that Tom would be so dangerous and the other people continue to talk down Tom much to the anger of Franky. Tom calms Franky down and suddenly speaks up saying he would like to confess. Tom then says that the raid on the judicial ship was led by him but requests to be pardoned from that crime. Jorge says that even if that was possible, Tom will be charged again for building the ship for Gold Roger and will receive the maximum penalty (death). Tom agrees to this saying he was proud of building a ship for the King of the Pirates Gold Roger much to the shock and anger of the people. Franky wants to know why and Tom tells Franky it's for the best not knowing the World Government would go to extreme lengths just to get the blueprints. Tom says that Water 7 is alive now saying he was glad to help out the city. Tom says his dream has finally begun to run and passes out from the tranquilizer's effects. In his mind, Tom tells Iceburg and Franky to take care of the blueprints and thanks everyone else (Kokoro and Yokozuna) for everything.\nSpandam is excited to see that the tranquilizers have taken effect and orders his group to capture Tom, Iceburg, and Franky. However, Jorge says that Tom alone will be taken to Enies Lobby much to the annoyance of Spandam. Spandam then orders for Iceburg and Franky to be let go while the Marines are preparing to take Tom away. Kokoro tearfully says that Tom can't be let go as he sacrificed himself to save Iceburg and Franky. She continues on saying that anyone that has been taken to Enies Lobby has never come back and Franky's rage suddenly explodes. Franky grabs a pistol from a Marine and smashes Spandam's face with it. The people are horrified by this and Iceburg, Kokoro, and Yokozuna are shocked by what Franky just did. Franky is then shot by a Marine and Iceburg tells Franky to run away. Franky manages to get away and, on board the Sea Train now, Spandam is angry that Franky got away. Soon, Spandam is notified that Franky is on the tracks and orders the Sea Train to keep going. Franky tells Yokozuna to stay away while he fires at Puffing Tom telling it to not take its creator away. With the blasts having no effect, attempts to stop the Sea Train himself and remembers how Tom let him stay with him. Franky says he wants to continue building ships but can't love ships that hurt people. However, he would want to be a great shipwright like Tom and Franky is soon run over by Puffing Tom. In his mind now, Franky says he will build his own dream ship that will proudly sail upon the waters.\nBack to the present, Rob Lucci says he heard that Tom was a great shipwright but was an uncontrollable Fish-Man with superhuman strength and has asked the citizens if they knew Tom but has gotten blank replies. Franky doesn't want to talk to Lucci anymore (with Usopp trying to calm him down) and Lucci says that many people and Marines were injured just because of Franky. However, due to Franky being confirmed dead after the Sea Train accident, the charges were dropped but now Franky is alive, he will be taken to Enies Lobby. Blueno, with a Den Den Mushi, walks up to Franky while Lucci speaks saying that their superior wants to speak to him. As Blueno tells the \"chief\" to speak, the man says he has spilled coffee on himself. However, he soon gets serious but is surprised to hear from Franky again. The man is surprised to see that Franky is still alive but Franky doesn't recognize the voice. The man continues saying how for eight years, his scars have been hurting but Franky demands to know who is talking to him. The man turns out to be Spandam saying he is the same person who arrested Tom's Workers years ago.",

Duval shows up again, not for revenge, but to thank Sanji since his kicks altered Duval's face to become handsome and suave, or so he thinks. To make up for the trouble he's caused, he leaves his Den Den Mushi number with the Straw Hats in case they may need his assistance before departing with the newly christened Rosy Life Riders. The Thousand Sunny sets sail for the Sabaody Archipelago, the stepping stone to Fish-Man Island. Hatchan explains that one needs to have their ship coated with a bubble resin in order to travel underwater, and once they reach Sabaody, he promises to find them a ship coater that he trusts. He also warns them that the World Nobles will be on the island, and no matter what happens, not to touch them, even if they witness a murder.",

The gang shows a mirror and then, Duval sees his new face in shock.\nMeanwhile, Luffy gorges on Hatchan's takoyaki on his Takoyaki 8 vendor ship. The crew enjoy the food that Hatchan prepared for them. Camie also presents some rice cakes and miso. Nami seems to have trouble tasting the food and threatens Hatchan. However, she finds the rice cakes tasty.\nAs they continue their tastes, Duval and his gang arrive, but the leader wants to thank Sanji for rearranging his face. He now has a handsome face and wants a rosy life. Before departing, Duval hopes the crew will ask if they have any troubles. Sanji orders him to leave believing he'll be happy. Duval then becomes infatuated with Nami thinking she blew him a kiss, but she was wiping sauce off her lips.\nUsopp calls Duval an idiot, but then the former Flying Fish leader presents his number and declares his gang the Rosy Life Riders.\nWith the crew stuffed and Hatchan tired, Camie cleans up with everyone satisfied. As Brook passes gas, Nami punches him in a rage.\nOver some tea, Camie then points out the crew needs to get to Sabaody Archipelago. Normally, the water pressure would crush submarines. Pappag announces he would enlighten the group about the ocean. There are two routes to get to the New World; One route allows Marine Ships through Marie Jois without trouble but will deny pirates passage. Another passage is the ocean floor passage that goes through Fish-Man Island.\nChopper seems to have second thoughts, but as the Thousand Sunny is not equipped to go underwater, Camie hopes to get the equipment for the ship.\nAt the bottom of the Red Line is a big hole that will lead to Fish-Man Island about 10,000 meters underwater. Camie also points out the ship needs a coating.\nJust then, the Thousand Sunny arrives at the Sabaody Archipelago with bubbles floating about.\nLuffy becomes excited to see the bubbles. Camie points out the bubbles float out of the ground. Hatchan then explains the mangrove trees as they stick to the water and home to the Hustle Muscle Mangroves. There is also a set of towns on the archipelago and numbers mark the trees. Bridges connect the islands.\nThe ship arrives at Grove 41 and Luffy gets off first. A bubble comes up and Luffy jumps onto them. Robin sees how the ground is sticky.\nLuffy then sees an amusement park called Sabaody Park with a ferris wheel that Camie is obsessed with, but Pappag denies her. Suddenly, the bubbles pop and drop Luffy to the ground hard but he then gets his head out.\nHatchan then explains they need to find a coating specialist so they can coat the Thousand Sunny. He also trusts an expert ship coater and hopes to find him, but also warns of the World Nobles. Under no circumstances are they to engage the World Nobles even if they kill someone.",

        "long_summary": "Two years have passed since the Summit War of Marineford. Sakazuki is now the new Fleet Admiral of the Marines. Due to the catastrophic destruction of Marineford, the Marines decided to build a new headquarters named New Marineford. New Marineford is an even greater fortress built to acclimate to the raging pirate era. It has become the new home of justice located at the entrance to the New World.\nSakazuki is angered when he learns that Fujitora has gone to Mary Geoise. He had only allowed the Admiral to set foot on a Marine base if he had captured Luffy and Law. Fujitora rationalizes his visit by saying that Mary Geoise isn't technically a Marine base. Sakazuki then finds out that Ryokugyu is also at Mary Geoise, so he orders T-Bone to have Ryokugyu turn Fujitora away when he sees him.\nHe and Borsalino talk about how Luffy's bounty has gone significantly higher. This makes Sakazuki regret not ending Luffy's life when he had the chance back in Marineford. He curses the Great Pirate Era and vows to end it. He recalls Whitebeard saying that, like there are people who have inherited Roger's will, there will also be others who will inherit Ace's. He adds that no matter how they might destroy their spirit, no one will be able to extinguish their flame.\nMeanwhile, Sengoku also muses about how quickly the Great Pirate Era gathered so much momentum in just two years. He commends Luffy for making history by being the first intruder to infiltrate Impel Down. Even if he snuck in alone, Luffy was able to escape with an army of inmates who had become allies, including former enemies. He also notes Luffy's ability to make miracles happen, such as when the Gates of Justice opened for Luffy's ship as he and some inmates tried to escape. He then recalls the events in Marineford, such as Whitebeard's arrival, the intense battle between the Marines and Whitebeard's fleet, and Luffy falling from the sky to rescue Ace.",

Inside, Nami is showering while Chopper asks if they'd be okay without her outside. Assuring him everything would be fine while deterring Sanji and Brook from peeking on her, Luffy, Zoro and Usopp set their eyes on catching a deep sea fish to eat. Knocking out the one Luffy had wanted, Usopp fires a makeshift fishing line into the fish's mouth in order to reel it in. Suddenly a two consecutively larger fish attempt to eat their predecessor on the line with the final fish being killed by Zoro who uses an upgraded technique.\nDue to the extra weight of the fish, the Thousand Sunny is drawn into a nearby White Strom, where after being tossed around extensively they are then stuck by something massive and are ejected from the current, discovering a pod of Island Whales to whom Luffy and Brook mistake for as Laboon. Despite realizing they weren't his friend, Brook still chooses to play a song for the whales who then help them to the surface of the New World where they're thrown into a rough sea and come across several Marine warships.",
        "long_summary": "The Straw Hats are heading to the New World. Nami is taking a bath in the Thousand Sunny and Chopper comes in. Nami asks Chopper if he wants to join her in the bath and he says no claiming that he took one two days ago and the cloud reminds him of cotton candy. Sanji and Brook walk by and saw Nami taking a bath so they stare at her. Nami asked Chopper to move aside away from the cloud she made and the cloud electrified Sanji and Brook. Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud.\nMeanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out. Luffy tells Usopp to hurry up with the fish hook because he wants to catch and eat a big fish. Robin says that Luffy and Usopp are having fun. Franky says he wants Cola with a big fish. Zoro says he wants to have a drink to celebrate entering the New World. Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp sees three big fish. Zoro wants to eat a fried fish with salt. Usopp wants a fish sliced up and grilled. Luffy wants a fish with mayonnaise. Usopp says which fish Luffy wants and claims that it is not edible. Luffy punches the fish with Gear 2 and Usopp uses the fish hook to grab hold of it. The fish that they caught suddenly got ate by a bigger fish and Zoro uses 360 pound cannon killing it. Nami is still in the bath and she claims that the rest of the crew are making too much of a ruckus and they she shouldn't have trusted them in watching the ship for her.\nThey suddenly got caught in a White Strom and Luffy claims it is the wormhole of his dreams and Usopp slaps him for saying that. Nami claims the crew to be stupid for getting into too much trouble while she was taking a bath. They get caught in the White Strom and they try to hang out to something so they won't fly out of the ship. They finally crash into a whale without noticing at first. Brook then claims that the whale is Laboon but they finally see a whole bunch of whales and the others claim that Laboon is not here but in the first half of the grand line. Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do. Nami says they don't need to do anything and Sanji listened. The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World. Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface. Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World.\nThey finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean. The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines.",

As Rebecca and Luffy talk, she reveals some of her past.",
        "long_summary": "The winners from the previous blocks of the Corrida Colosseum: Jesus Burgess from Block A, Bartolomeo from Block B and Luffy still in the disguise of Lucy, are mentioned once again. Due to the repairs on the destroyed arena caused by the fight between Luffy and Chinjao, the start of the Block D competition is delayed by fifteen minutes.\nAs Luffy leaves the ring, Cavendish attacks him with Durandal, but Luffy dodges all the strikes.The fight catches the attention of Bartolomeo, who is annoyed with Cavendish for wanting to kill Luffy. A couple of competitors overheard Cavendish mentioning Luffy's epithet, and mock Luffy not being able to save Ace in the \"War of the Best\". Bartolomeo uses his devil fruit powers to crush the man against a wall, as the man threatens that he is a noble. Bartolomeo grabs the competitors tongue and says that Luffy will become the future Pirate King. He begins to explain his past with the pirate.\nTwo years ago, Bartolomeo was at Loguetown, when Luffy was about to be executed by Buggy on the same platform where Gol D. Roger was executed. At the last second, a lightning strike hit the sword, destroying the platform and saving Luffy's life. This amazed and inspired Bartolomeo, who started to read every news story about the Straw Hat's actions in the Grand Line. Eventually, after the events at Marineford, he set out to become a pirate, forming the Barto Club. Bartolomeo then threatens the noble's tongue with a knife, before beating him up.\nMeanwhile, Luffy manages to grab Cavendish's sword, and the two struggle to overcome one another. Bartolomeo tries to get Cavendish's attention, but is too awestruck by Luffy to speak properly. Chinjao, Sai and Boo, leaving the ring, call to Luffy to thank him for returning Chinjao's drill-shaped head. The old pirate says that he will not hold any grudge against Garp anymore, and bows his head, accidentally splitting the floor. Luffy, not paying attention and assuming that Chinjao wants to fight him again, runs away amidst the confusion, with Cavendish, Bartolomeo and the Chinjao Family following him.\nAfter escaping from them, Luffy is found by Rebecca, who leads him away. While he is running, Luffy spots Jesus Burgess talking to his captain, Blackbeard. Burgess tells Blackbeard that he cannot trust Aokiji, to which Blackbeard notes the same can be said of their crewmate, Shiryu. After Burgess notifies Blackbeard of Luffy's presence, the Emperor tells Luffy that Burgess will win the Mera Mera no Mi, and brags that it will be just like having Ace in his crew. As Rebecca leads Luffy away, he says to her that Burgess will not win the fruit. He passes by a stall and starts eating, asking if there are any more free samples. Rebecca buys some of them for him, and Luffy thanks her. When they stop to eat, Rebecca tells Luffy that they are in the quarters of the gladiators, and mentions that some of them call it a prison.\nWhen Luffy asks Rebecca if she is hungry, Rebecca remembers some of her childhood. When she was a young girl, she said to her mother that she was hungry, and her mother replied that they have not had anything for two days. Rebecca remembers seeing her dead mother, and replies to Luffy that she does not get hungry. One of the convict gladiators grabs Luffy, and he asks Rebecca what is going on. Rebecca picks up her sword and attacks Luffy. He avoids the attacks and pins her down, without dropping his food. Rebecca tells Luffy that he can do what he wants and that her real intention is to kill him, but he says that she had no intention of killing him. Luffy is surprised by the convict gladiators, since they are all injured and covered with bandages. The convict gladiators tell Luffy that they fought in the Colosseum because they went against the Donquixote Family and according to the king, they will only be released when they win a thousand fights. After hearing this, Rebecca announces her desire to win the tournament and kill Donquixote Doflamingo.",

        "long_summary": "Franky, angry, charges in and attempts to attack Kalifa for injuring Mozu and Kiwi but Blueno blocks his attack using Tekkai. However, Franky manages to pick up Blueno and overpowering him while yelling at the CP9 agent. Blueno attempts to use Shigan on Franky but Rob Lucci stops him saying they need Franky alive after kicking Franky away. Usopp is surprised at Franky thinking what he did to get Lucci and the others mad (still thinking they're with Galley-La). Franky wants to know how CP9 found out his hidden base but Lucci says it's irrelevant and says that they are there now and are assigned an operation. He then reveals to Franky that they are spies working for the World Government and surprises Franky by revealing his real name as \"Cutty Flam\". Franky is impressed on their detective work but is worried and wants to know where Iceburg is. Lucci says that he is dead much to Franky's shock. Lucci continues saying that Tom entrusted the blueprints to Pluton to Iceburg who then entrusted to Franky and demands Franky to hand over the blueprints. Franky, enraged, fires his right hand at Lucci who effortlessly dodges it and ruthlessly knocks Franky backwards sending him crashing through the wall. Usopp is shocked at what just happened and the crash reveals a secret room. Lucci is surprised to see this and Kalifa informs them they are drafting tables. Lucci confirms that it may be where the Pluton blueprints are and orders the other CP9 agents to find them. Blueno spots nameplates that says \"Cutty Flam\", \"Iceburg\", and \"Tom\" and Lucci walks over to a picture. Franky, who is up on his feet again, tells Lucci not to touch it saying that picture is his memories and is where he grew up with Tom's Workers.\nA long flashback starts with a younger Franky riding on one of his Battle Frankies to Water 7. Franky turns around spots a large Sea King chasing after him and fires cannonballs at it. However, it has no effect only angering the beast more. The Sea King dives into the water causing Franky to crash onto land over Iceburg. Iceburg yells at Franky but soon runs away after seeing the large Sea King who attempts to attack him. Iceburg yells at Franky again saying they should be working on ships and not some \"toys\" but Franky yells back saying they're not toys but his battleships the Battle Frankies. They continue arguing until Tom lifts up the ship and builds it together using sheer strength. Tom is excited at his work with Yokozuna agreeing and Iceburg and Franky are staring in shock. Tom and Yokozuna walk off with Iceburg and Franky giving chase. At Tom's Workers, the group are eating and Tom asks about Franky's latest Battle Franky model. Iceburg blasts Franky on how his latest ship almost got both of them killed but Franky yells back at him. Tom could only laugh at this while Kokoro walks in and tries to calm them down. Kokoro then says that another ship carrying lumber was attacked by pirates and that since the King of the Pirates was executed, the entire city was being taken over. She continues saying that due to that, people are losing hope and that Aqua Laguna is preventing them from getting lumber properly. She fears that Water 7 will eventually sink into the ocean due to the frequent Aqua Laguna hits. Franky remembers that Tom build a large pirate ship before and asks if he could build one. However, Tom laughs angering Franky and Tom says that there is no such thing as a blueprint for a pirate ship but the flag makes it. Later that night, Franky wonders what Tom is working on and Tom says that it's hope for their island and then tells Franky to go to bed.\nAt daytime, a large Judicial Ship pulls into Water 7 and the people want to know what they are here for. It turns out that they are here for Tom and the Marines start to bring him aboard the ship. Franky and Iceburg attempt to get to Tom but a couple of Marines stop them but Tom reassures them that he will be fine. Aboard the ship, the trial is being watched over by Jorge and one of the men says that Tom was responsible of building the Oro Jackson: Gold Roger's ship. He says that Tom has been sentenced to be executed in Enies Lobby due to his involvement with Gold Roger and Franky is horrified to hear this. Jorge says that building a ship is not a crime but says that he must make an exception for the King of the Pirates. Jorge then says that Tom is sentenced to death and orders the Marines to take him away. However, the Marines are unable to move Tom due to his size and strength and Tom starts to speak up about his new project. He says that it will be a train that will run on the surface of the water and says that he'll help lift up the spirits of the people by building a Sea Train. The people and even Jorge sound interested and Jorge tells the Marines to let Tom stay and asks Tom to tell him more. Tom says that the Sea Train is like a ship but pumps out steam and runs on the tracks. He says that it will transport people, goods, and even ships to other islands and won't be affected by the conditions of the seas. Two people complain saying that Aqua Laguna will destroy the tracks and the Sea Kings will cause trouble as well. However, Tom says that the tracks will be submerged under the water a bit so that it won't be affected by the waves and even plans on adding a special siren underwater so that the fish will be alerted when the Sea Train is coming. He says that it will even scare off the Sea Kings so that they won't bother the Sea Train. He plans on connecting the tracks to multiple places much to the excitement of the people and Tom says that he'll finish up the blueprints very soon but says that it'll take a master shipwright to build it. Jorge says that will the Sea Train will also run to Enies Lobby which Tom confirms this and says that the Sea Train will fill Water 7 back with hope. Jorge says how long it will take and Tom says that it will take ten years to build it. Jorge then tells Tom to build it and tells Tom that the next ten years will be considered as probation. The people are excited to hear the idea about the Sea Train but Franky still looks worried.\nBack at Tom's Workers, Tom is glad to still be alive but Kokoro is a little worried that Tom was laughing but is glad to hear about the Sea Train. Iceburg comments saying that the Sea Train is a great idea but Franky suddenly gets up and teaches Yokozuna how to do the front crawl. Iceburg yells at Franky for leaving but Franky is still angry over how the World Government wants to execute Tom for all the work he has done. Franky leaves showing Yokozuna how to swim and Iceburg is still upset at him and even tells Tom that he should kick him out for how he is behaving. Tom says that two years ago, he found Franky on Scrap Heap Island firing cannonballs and Franky says that his parents ditched him. Tom says that his parents were most likely pirates that couldn't handle his behavior. Tom says that he has a good heart and says that he and Iceburg will become master shipwrights someday. Some scenes are shown with Tom showing the finished blueprints to Iceburg and Yokozuna cheers on. The three being to work on the raft while Franky watches from a distance. He constructs another Battle Franky but the others are more focused on building the Sea Train. Eventually, Franky starts to help out much to Tom's pleasure. Franky, Tom, Iceburg, and Yokozuna being constructing while facing several hindrances along the way (including being chased by Sea Kings and the railing breaking apart). Years later, the people are still sulking until one person says that the Sea Train has been completed. The people begin boarding the Sea Train with Kokoro being the conductor. The Sea Train successfully sets off much to the pleasure of the people, Tom, Yokozuna, Iceburg, and Franky. The Sea Train, Puffing Tom, officially makes its departure filling Water 7 with hope.",
