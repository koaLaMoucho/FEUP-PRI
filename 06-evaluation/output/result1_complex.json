        "air_date": "July 19, 2020",
        "short_summary": "The Sumo Inferno continues and Queen sends in the Gifters after Luffy defeats the Pleasures.\nAt the Oihagi Bridge, Zoro clashes with Gyukimaru to get Shusui back. Their fight is interrupted when a woman and Toko arrive seeking help as they were chased by an assassin known as Kamazo. Zoro then decides to fight the assassin to protect the woman and the girl.",
        "long_summary": "Big Mom rides to Udon where she and Tama express their love for red bean soup. Chopper fears that Big Mom will return to her normal self if she finds out that there was no red bean soup.\nHowever, Queen enjoys several bowls of the soup, revealing there was plenty of soup at Udon. Luffy continues to defeat the Pleasures with ease, so Queen decides to bring out the Gifters. Luffy is put against Batman, with advanced hearing, flight and a bow and arrow, and Gazelleman, with super speed. Despite this, Luffy defeats them relatively swiftly with Haki-imbued punches. Still, Luffy is disappointed that he could not defeat them without touching them like Rayleigh did.\nAt the bridge of Ringo, the sword thief, identified as Gyukimaru, battles against Zoro. He becomes angry when Zoro states that he met Ryuma. Gyukimaru explains Ryuma's significance. Several nobles in the past attempted to take over Wano Country but Ryuma was a formidable samurai who prevented them from doing so.\nTheir duel is interrupted by Komurasaki, who somehow survived Kyoshiro's attack, but is running away from an assassin, Hitokiri Kamazo, the slasher previously mentioned in the news. Kamazo intends to kill Toko for laughing and Komurasaki for disrespecting the shogun. Zoro helps Komurasaki in exchange for sake and food.\nZoro and Kamazo begin fighting, and the duel reaches a standstill as they seem equally matched. Zoro removes his outer garment, ready to fight harder.",

        "short_summary": "Zoro tries to fight for Luffy since he lies helplessly on the ground. Through Zoro's efforts, Kuma offers a deal to him. He tells him that he can take all of Luffy's pain away, but has to implant it in Zoro. Zoro agrees to this deal when Kuma says he could die from all of this pain. Kuma takes all of Luffy's pain away from him, gives a small portion to Zoro, then Zoro jumps into Luffy's pain (bubble).",
        "long_summary": "After the devastating power of Kuma's Ursus Shock, everyone of the Straw Hat Pirates and the Rolling Pirates are knocked out. Kuma then takes this time to try and capture Luffy who is still worn out from his fight with Moria earlier. However, just as Kuma picks up Luffy, he is suddenly attacked by Zoro who slashes at him with Ittoryu Iai: Shishi Sonson. This attack manages to damage Kuma but Zoro is shocked to see cybernetic parts under Kuma. Zoro says he should've known that Kuma is a cyborg like Franky and Kuma fires a laser from his mouth that misses Zoro directly but the shockwave sends him flying.\nZoro is shocked to see that Kuma is able to fire a laser from his mouth and Kuma explains that he is a Pacifista. He continues on saying that a Pacifista is a creation designed to work for the World Government and says that he, himself, was created by the infamous Dr. Vegapunk. Zoro replies saying that Kuma has a major advantage being a Pacifista with Devil Fruit powers. Zoro also says that his body has given up on him but, not wanting to give up his captain's head, offers up his own life to Kuma. Zoro says his bounty may not be as high as Luffy's, but he is willing to give up his dream to become the world's greatest swordsmen in exchange. A surprised Kuma looks on how Zoro is willingly to give up his life and dream to make his captain's dream come true. Suddenly, Sanji gets up and offers up his life instead. However, Zoro, who already made up his mind, knocks Sanji out.\nZoro turns his attention back to Kuma who throws his swords in front of him and asks Kuma to show some honor. Kuma, after thinking for a while, agrees to Zoro's plea, saying that it wouldn't be honorable for him to still attack Luffy. Kuma, picking up Luffy, tells Zoro that he will spare Luffy but not before Zoro takes Luffy's place by experiencing all the pain he has endured during his time on Thriller Bark. Kuma then uses his powers to repel all the pain out of Luffy into a large, red mass of air. Kuma says that Zoro must take all of Luffy's pain if he really does want to take his place saying that the experience will kill Zoro as he is close to death. Kuma sends over a sample to Zoro and Zoro suffers intense pain from that small sample. Zoro falls to the ground but barely manages to make it back to his feet. Zoro then sticks his arms into the giant mass of pain. Kuma then remarks on Dragon having a good son.\nLater, the Straw Hats and the Rolling Pirates all regain consciousness. Franky is surprised to see Luffy acting well, who tells the crew that his body feels as good as new. As the other Straw Hats wonder why, Sanji runs off toward Zoro's direction. He reaches Zoro and asks what happened to the Warlord, but notices blood everywhere. Sanji asks Zoro what happened, and Zoro, who is covered head to toe in blood, says that nothing happened.",

        "long_summary": "Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire confront Bill, who mocks their dreams of reaching the top of the New World as childish. Bill reveals to Desire that he used everyone in his Silver Pirate Alliance to give him wealth so that he could live the most luxurious life in the world, and questions whether she really intends to defeat him and if she really believes she is stronger than him. Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill. The Silver Pirate Alliance members attack Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire as Bill prepares to kill them all with a bazooka. However, Luffy uses Supreme King Haki to knock out the pirates and their battle boats, leaving Bill alone and shocked. Luffy sees where Bill is, and Bill fires a cannonball at him, but Luffy shatters it as he punches Bill into the underground mine.\nBill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.\nBartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island. At the coast, the Silver Pirate Alliance and the Sweet Pirates get everyone onto a large ship as they prepare to escape the island's destruction. The Sweet Pirates worry about Desire, but are forced to set sail. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Barto Club are worried about Luffy and Bartolomeo, but Zoro is confident that they are all right since Luffy's vivre card is fine. Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.\nLater in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles. Inside Gran Tesoro, Tanaka arrives and reports to the Monster of the New World, a man named Gild Tesoro. Tanaka reports that Bill sank along with Silver Mine, but Tesoro is fine as he already had his fun with Bill and now was time for the real entertainment to start.",

However, Luffy loses the upper hand when Katakuri regains his composure.\nBack at Cacao Island, Pound arrives at the Sweets Factory, wanting to see Chiffon, but when Oven arrives, he attacks Pound. Inside the factory, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e speaks to Pudding through a Den Den Mushi and informs her of the Straw Hats' plan to arrive at Cacao Island.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy manages to hit Katakuri while in Gear 4, sending him rocketing into the wall. Seizing the advantage as he continues assaulting the Sweet Commander, Luffy states that he has figured out Katakuri's powers. He remembers the beginning of his training on Rusukaina, where Rayleigh explained the abilities of Observation and Armament Haki. Luffy has realized now that there is nothing out of the ordinary with Katakuri's Devil Fruit; the Sweet Commander had simply been using his Observation Haki to move his body out of the way up until now, and now that this has been nullified, his strong Armament Haki is unable to withstand Gear 4. Katakuri continues to be hit and sent flying by Luffy's attacks, but with Br\u00fbl\u00e9e's words about his back never touching the ground fresh in his mind, he does everything in his power to stay on his feet, and at one point he even has to use his head to bounce off the ground.\nHowever, Katakuri eventually regains his focus, and when Luffy attacks him, he confirms that Luffy's understanding of his abilities is correct as he foresees where the attacks will land, transforms the body parts that will be attacked into mochi, and changes the shape of those parts to dodge the attacks. With his composure back, Katakuri now regains the advantage, and he traps Luffy's outstretched arm in his stomach as he recognizes how the Straw Hat managed to defeat his brother Cracker. He then creates two donut-shaped mochi pieces from the ground and forms them into giant rectangular arms, which he controls remotely with his own arms. He then uses these giant arms to deliver a devastating strike to Luffy that manages to injure him in Gear 4.\nOn Cacao Island, Pudding receives a call from Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who checks in on the cake and reveals that she has overheard the Straw Hats' plan. Outside of the factory, meanwhile, the citizens are shocked to see Pound approaching them. Pound wishes to enter and see his daughter Chiffon, but the citizens push him back due to Pudding's wishes. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tells Pudding that the Straw Hats are planning to reunite with Luffy on Cacao Island at 1 AM, but they will have no luck in doing so as she reveals that Luffy is fighting Katakuri in the Mirro-World and will thus surely die. Even if the Straw Hats get to Cacao Island earlier, they will be intercepted by Oven's army which has just arrived. Oven is told by the Choco Police that he cannot enter the Sweets Factory, which he accepts, and he then spots Pound knocking on the door trying to get in. Oven recognizes his former stepfather and punches him, and Pound pleads his former stepson for mercy. However, Oven states that disposing of Pound is necessary, as Big Mom will be coming to Cacao Island and would not be happy to see him. Inside the factory, Pudding expresses worry to Sanji about Luffy going against the undefeated Katakuri, but Sanji only responds with confidence that Katakuri will take his first loss today as Luffy continues charging at the Sweet Commander.",

However he manages to break free as the ice hadn't reached his heart. Seeing nothing to gain from fighting Kuzan, Doflamingo decides to take his leave, but not before questioning Kuzan what he stands for due to rumors he had heard. Kuzan does not answer him and yells for a medic. Doflamingo collects Baby 5 and Buffalo and departs. Only then does Kuzan states that he never fully trusted the World Government, and believes that he can make a difference outside the Marines, hence why he is not enlisted in the Marines anymore. Smoker inquires about how he knew of Punk Hazard as one of the World Government's top secrets, worrying that Kuzan is involved with the criminal underworld.\nThe G-5 Marines, who were eavesdropping on the conversation, are yelled at by Kuzan, who asks them to clear off, now that they have treated Smoker. He then informs Smoker that he is doing nothing of the sort. He also warns Smoker to tell Sakazuki to keep an eye on Doflamingo as he poses the biggest threat to the Marines for now. For, even though Doflamingo's presence is not as obvious as the Kuja Pirates, his prowess as a pirate is quite exceptional. He tells Smoker to ask the Fleet Admiral to dispatch the Admirals as soon as possible. He also asks the G-5 marines not to reveal his presence there, to which they oblige.\nOut on the sea, the crew is taking a breather. Usopp and Chopper worry furiously about Doflamingo coming to attack them. Kin'emon nearly gets into a duel with Zoro thinking he had robbed Ryuma's grave due to him having his sword, the Shusui, on him. Momonosuke is revealed to be taking a bath with Robin much to the envious anger of Sanji, Brook and Kin'emon.\nWhen they confront Momonosuke over it, Nami punches all three for their supposed bullying. On being saved, he addresses Nami as a fair princess, which prompts Nami to hug him, much to the anger of the three perverts. Momonosuke rubs his face onto Nami's breasts on purpose, while grinning wickedly at the three. As the night goes on, most of the crew (Luffy, Zoro, Brook, Nami, Robin, Law and Momonosuke) sleep while others (Usopp, Chopper, Franky, Sanji, and Kin'emon) stay up looking after the Sunny.\nMeanwhile, a mysterious individual in the sea watches the ship with the intent to steal Caesar Clown.",

        "short_summary": "Franky in his Shogun puts up a good fight against the two subordinates of Doflamingo and he sends them flying away with a portable version of the Thousand Sunny's Gaon Cannon, but the two refuse to stay defeated despite their injuries.\nThe fight however was interrupted with the arrival of the mine cart filled with all of the lab escapees. Seeing that Law has allied with the enemy and that the odds are against them, Buffalo and Baby 5 decide to hightail out of Punk Hazard, with Caesar Clown in their possession. Before Law could stop them, Luffy stops him, saying that Usopp and Nami will handle this. The two Straw Hats prove Luffy right, as they easily stop the fleeing pirates and succeed in capturing Caesar.\nMeanwhile, far away from Punk Hazard, Doflamingo is still flying toward Punk Hazard imagining what torture he would inflict on the brats, while elsewhere on a giant penguin, a mysterious man is wondering which direction leads to Punk Hazard.",
        "long_summary": "Buffalo is surprised by how strong the Franky Shogun is. He then charges at Franky, saying that no one has ever been able to dodge the next attack. Using his powers, he spins Baby 5 on one of his chains, who in turn uses Sickle Girl, and then slams her into Franky Shogun's left arm, impaling it. Franky laughs and says he will give them credit, but only for breaking through the robot's armor, and compares the pair to a praying mantis taking on a warship. He then grabs Baby 5 and yanks on the chain, causing Buffalo to lose his balance and hurl forward. He then declares that the Gaon Cannon has set foot on land, and shoots them with Franky Shogun's most powerful attack, General Cannon. As Buffalo and Baby 5 are reeling from the attack, they wonder why someone like this would try to impede them taking Caesar. Franky then looks down from the tanker and sees Caesar lying there, and wonders how the scientist got there. Buffalo stands up, declaring that he is not going down that easily, saying that such a defeat would drag Joker's name through the mud. Baby 5 then declares that they will be taking Caesar with them, no matter what it takes. Franky then asks them if he is correct in concluding that they want Caesar.\nBack in R-66, the exit is in sight. Usopp begs Nami to conjure up some wind, so they will not die. Everyone cheers as they exit. Franky is happy to see that everyone made it out. Baby 5 and Buffalo are seen surprised by their sudden arrival. Luffy, Usopp, Chopper, and the rest of the boys in the cart are very excited to see the robot, while Nami, Robin, Tashigi, and the rest of the girls are visibly unimpressed. Law is surprised to see Buffalo and Baby 5, who asks him if he is really going to defy Joker, who has been saving the heart seat for him. Luffy asks if those two are Law's friends, and Law tells him no. Realizing their sudden disadvantage, Buffalo and Baby 5 grab Caesar and start to fly away. Usopp tells everyone to leave the escaping pair to him. Law is about to use his powers and tries to argue, but Luffy cuts him off, telling him that Usopp has things under control, and Zoro tells him not to underestimate Usopp. Law argues, saying that if they get away, the plan will be ruined. Nami cuts him off again, saying that if they are going to have an alliance, then Law needs to trust them more, adding that she needs to do a little fighting after doing nothing but running. Usopp and Nami then declare that they will take care of the far away enemies with their backs turned, and Zoro tells them to hurry up. Usopp then orders his Bakun Grass to grow into his Kuro Kabuto, which then starts eating the nearby rubble and twisted metal. Buffalo tells Baby 5 to watch the rear, since he cannot while flying. While Baby 5 vows to defend them with her life, a giant weather egg, called Lightning-chan by Nami, flies over them and releases a huge storm cloud. Baby 5 looks at the cloud worriedly while Nami declares they will not get away. She then attacks them with Thunder Breed Tempo, landing a direct hit. \nAs they start falling, Buffalo calls to Baby 5 and realizes she is unconscious. Usopp then attacks them with Killer Shooting Star Rush, shooting several pieces of stone from the rubble at them. Caesar tells Buffalo that, since he cannot move, he must protect him and Buffalo declares that he will complete a mission for the Donquixote family as they are pelted with rubble. As the two go down, Caesar manages to stay airborne as the shots pass through him. He then decides he will go to Dressrosa by himself. Usopp tells him that escaping is useless, since the last shot was seastone handcuffs. The cuffs catch Caesar around the neck. Everyone cheers as Usopp proudly declares that he will fight anyone whose back is turned. As the three fall into the ocean, Law declares the first step of his plan is complete and Luffy asks Law what he thought about his crew's abilities.\nSomewhere on the sea, a shadowy figure has overslept, and is wondering how to get to Punk Hazard.",

        "long_summary": "Gatz announces with surprise that Hajrudin has been defeated, referring to him as a favored warrior and speaking for everyone when he calls it unexpected. The crowd loves it and starts cheering for Lucy. Meanwhile, Luffy is helping Ucy to safety, saying he is taking the bull to the corner. Cavendish is unimpressed by Luffy's power, while Bartolomeo seems to enjoy the display. Rebecca is completely shocked by Lucy's might. Ideo walks over the unconscious Hajrudin, remarks that the ring is no place for a nap and delivers an explosive punch that propels Hajrudin huge body into the audience stands, panicking spectators before it falls into the water. Gatz was again surprised to see the blasting force of Ideo's punches, referring to him by his epithet \"Destroyer Cannon\". Ideo then declares he will get stronger by eating the Mera Mera no Mi as he blasts away more fighters.\nGatz then turns the crowd's attention to the three fighters from Kano Country, referring to them as famous kenpo users. Sai is then seen shattering a fighter's helmet and shield and knocking him out. Sai is then introduced as the thirteenth leader of the Happo Navy. Gatz refers to the navy's power and centuries of martial experience. Boo is then seen defeating a contender and is introduced as the vice leader of the navy. Chinjao is lastly introduced as the retired twelfth leader of the Happo Navy, while he is being surrounded by a ring of fighters. As the gang attempt to move in on Chinjao, he presses his hands together and knocks out several fighters with Supreme King Haki, stunning the crowd. Other fighters recall his bounty and legendary status as a pirate, and Chinjao turns to them and warns that he is only after one person so they should stay out of his way.\nImmediately in front of Chinjao, Jean Ango is seen collecting the weapons of fallen gladiators and thanks Chinjao for incidentally supplying them. He is then introduced as the bounty hunter \"Jean the Robber\". Gatz recalls that Ango is a bounty hunter hated by many pirates in the New World. A fighter charges at him, crying that he won't forgive Ango for sending his partner to jail. Ango simply says that he's a sniper, and the weapons he scavenges are his bullets. He throws a sword clean through the charging man and tells him to attack the prison if he cares so much about his partner, as someone already did two years ago.\nElsewhere, Kelly Funk is mercilessly beating a fighter who is already well past unconsciousness. The crowd dislikes such overkill and shouts at him in disapproval. Bobby tells his brother to stop and tries to grab him but accidentally seizes the victim instead. The brothers are then introduced as killers from the Mogaro Kingdom. Kelly angrily tells his brother the guy he beat up called him a little midget, and asks Bobby for his opinion. Bobby assures him he is not but Kelly once again lays into the unfortunate fighter, and Bobby again grabs the wrong person in an attempt to stop his brother. Kelly finishes his brutal beat down with a threat to gouge the man's eyes out. Gatz mentions that the brothers are notorious in the underworld, adding that the rumor about them is that they were able to handle pirates with bounties exceeding 100,000,000 Beli.\nBoo comes up on them, curious to see how a boxer with no formal training fairs against him and immediately sends Kelly Funk flying with a quick jab to the chin. The crowd is stunned by how easily Kelly was sent flying. Gatz once again shows his personal opinion in the commentary, saying that Boo is too strong while one of his booth assistants keeps him from saying more. Boo then turns his sights on Bobby Funk, who reacts fearfully and claims he had never been in a fight, showing his back as Boo swings an axe down on him. To his surprise, the axe shattered, even though he had used Busoshoku Haki to enforce the blade, leaving Boo to wonder how strong Bobby's body is. Bobby tends to his brother, still furious about being mocked for his height, and tells him to \"put it on\". Suddenly, what appears to be a larger, enraged Kelly wearing Bobby's hat turns the tables on Boo, to Sai's consternation, hitting him with a barrage of punches that knocks him unconscious and pummels him on the ground. Gatz cannot tell which brother is actually attacking, guessing that Kelly has transformed into a different person.\nSomewhere else, Jean Ango has stolen Luffy's helmet; worrying that his cover is blown, Luffy is forced to use his cape to hide his face and hat. Ango mentions that he heard something interesting about Lucy, and mentioned the rumor that Monkey D. Luffy had snuck into the tournament. Luffy looks to his right and sees Chinjao knocking down fighters to get to him. Gatz announces that about forty people remain in the block, saying it is still anyone's game.",

As her first technique, this new homie fires a powerful lightning bolt at Kid and Killer, hitting them at near point-blank range and shaking the entire island.\nMeanwhile, Nami, Tama, and Usopp attempt to return to the Live Floor on Komachiyo while Page One chases them. Page One transforms into his hybrid form and leaps onto Komachiyo's back, but Komachiyo begins to speed up, running into a wall at full speed and ramming Page One into it.\nKid and Killer emerge from the rubble somewhere inside the castle. Big Mom is on the floor directly below them, still in pursuit of Kid. Suddenly, they are attacked by Hawkins, and Kid becomes enraged that Hawkins abandoned Kid in favour of Kaidou. Kid decides to advance while Killer battles Hawkins. Hawkins uses Goma no So, transforming into a scarecrow-like figure.\nBack on the roof, Luffy notices that Kaidou had the rare power of Supreme King Haki. He also remembers Hyougoro's lessons on Internal Destruction Armament Haki, where one directs their Haki into the target, damaging the target internally. With this, Luffy strikes Kaidou's stomach without touching him, then unleashes a powerful uppercut knocking Kaidou over. With this, Luffy tells Law and Zoro to head downstairs while he battles Kaidou on his own.",

But Pica was not out of the fight and attacked again with his remaining arm, throwing the fighters in disarray. The fighters then noticed that Luffy is missing and one of them sees Luffy riding Ucy while climbing the colossus arm toward the giant head. Pica noticed this and grew his arm back, before going to strike his attacker, but Luffy was ready and breaks the giant's head off with a Grizzly Magnum. Meanwhile, Robin's group reaches the top of the plaza and manage to elude their pursuers. Pica was then revealed to be controlling the colossus from within, and prepares to cut Luffy down with a huge sword, but Zoro intercepts it and stays behind to duel Pica while Luffy races toward Doflamingo's palace.",
        "long_summary": "The citizens of Dressrosa are shocked to see Pica's arm crumble apart after Chinjao's and Elizabello II's attack, and Luffy, in a panic, rides Ucy away from the falling rubble. The soldiers on the streets attempt to stop the Colosseum fighters but are thwarted by Ideo, who uses Destruction Cannon to blow the shocked soldiers away. Orlumbus and Cavendish join using the moves Admiral's Hug and Swan Lake. The soldiers cannot stop them, but Pica gears up for another assault on the fighters. Chinjao prepares to hold the Donquixote executive off. Still, Zoro sees that Pica's severed arm has grown back and, knowing that continuing fighting like this would be useless, shouts at everybody to run. Dagama tries to give a strategy for Pica but mentions that running is their best option for surviving for now.\nThe fighters run away from Pica's second attack, which destroys more of Dressrosa, and the fighters are at a loss on how to get through Pica to Doflamingo's castle. Suddenly, Cavendish notices that Luffy isn't with them, and the fighters are incredibly shocked to see the Straw Hat riding Ucy up Pica's arm. Luffy heads up excitedly, and Abdullah and Jeet, having also hitched a ride on Ucy, also cheer, which causes Luffy to realize they are there and yell at them to get off. Pica then notices Luffy and, in silent rage, grows his arm back, preparing to attack the pirate. Luffy attacks him first, however, hitting Pica in the face with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum. The attack shatters Pica's face and shocks the fighters and citizens below.\nMeanwhile, Robin's group continues to climb up to the plaza while the former ex-toys follow in pursuit of the bounty. One grabs Rebecca, but Robin uses her slap move to shake them off, stating she won't let them touch her. They all reach the top, and Robin dispels her ability, letting them all fall back to the Coliseum.\nBack with Pica, Zoro, having ridden on Ucy with Luffy, points out that Pica's shattered arm and head were pure stone and that Pica's natural body was located where his fake head was. Zoro remarks that Pica finally shows some human characteristics when the Donquixote executive pulls out a giant sword, scaring Abdullah and Jeet. They beg Ucy to turn around or stop, but the bull cannot do either as Pica swings at it. However, Luffy manages to get underneath Ucy and propel it upward, out of the sword's path. Ucy lands behind Pica, but the executive officer quickly turns around, preparing to strike again. Thankfully, Zoro manages to counter his blow with one sword, which causes a shocked Abdullah and Jeet to call him and Luffy \"comrades of god.\" Pica tells Zoro to get out of the way so he can deal with Luffy, but Zoro says that Luffy has no business with a chunk of stone like him and mocks his high-pitched voice calling him a \"soprano-voiced dumbass,\" enraging Pica further.",

Smoker withstands some shots and believes this pointless fights are injustice. Koby is off the deep end thinking of the times he spent with Luffy.\nWhile Akainu strikes down Curiel, he orders the Marines to show no mercy. Koby trips over a dead marine and tries to wake him up, but finds a necklace. He finds a picture of the dead Marine's family.\nAs Teach yells that there might no one to challenge him, Kizaru fires a light blast at Buggy daring him to come and face him. With insufficient time, Buggy throws Jinbe and Luffy to Jean Bart. With Luffy's injuries far worse than Sabaody, Kizaru prepares to finish Luffy once and for all. Koby yells that it's enough.\nKoby reasons that the fighting is done and the Marines are victorious. The young marine calls out that all Marines have families and questions that the Marines need to prove. Akainu tells him to leave and is wasting time. Sensing that Koby does not believe in justice, Akainu moves to execute Koby but a sword stops him. Everyone watches in shock. It was Shanks who stopped the fatal blow, and he says that Koby's speech will change the world whether for better or worse. With Luffy and Jinbe raced below deck, Kizaru almost delivers the coup de grace, but Benn Beckman holds him at gunpoint. With the Marines in shock, Shanks picks up his Straw Hat and announces he will bring an end to the war.",

        "long_summary": "Bellamy reaches the palace rooftop, and Doflamingo asks him why he came. Bellamy then asks if it was really Doflamingo who sent Dellinger to kill him, wondering if he can no longer do anything for Doflamingo. Doflamingo laughs, and tells his former underling that the two of them had different goals from the start. While Bellamy was content to be an ordinary pirate, Doflamingo's main goal was to destroy the world, which seemingly horrifies Bellamy.\nElsewhere, the Corrida Colosseum fighters continue toward Doflamingo's castle. However, Dellinger focuses on one fighter: Suleiman. Several apparitions of Dellinger surround Suleiman, and the Donquixote officer rams into the combatant, stabbing him with his horns. The other fighters are shocked to see Suleiman go down, and turn their attention to the other officers. Chinjao, however, pays them no mind, as he has already climbed to the third floor of the palace. However, Gladius uses his powers to blow up part of the wall, causing Chinjao to fall. Boo is shocked at this turn of events, and does not notice a ten-ton Machvise falling on top of him until it is too late. The Dressrosa soldiers cheer as the tables are turned on the Colosseum fighters, while Lao G and Baby 5 deal with Orlumbus and Dagama, respectively.\nIn the south of the Dressrosa village, the citizens of Dressrosa manage to tie down one of the citizens who had been controlled by Parasite. The controlled citizen tearfully apologizes for all the atrocious actions he was forced to do, but the other citizens know it was not his fault. Just then, another citizen races toward them, exclaiming that he knew where King Riku and \"God\" Usopp were. Eager to end Doflamingo's game as soon as possible, the citizens take up arms and prepare to capture the two alive, using their \"prisoners\" as bait.\nAt the SMILE Factory, the overseers force the enslaved dwarves to clean up a spilled SAD container, and attempt to draw their attention away from the chaos outside by whipping them and continuing to tell them about Princess Mansherry's \"illness\". As the overseers bark out orders, however, the dwarves notice words on the outside of their cage, asking them to open the lock from the inside. The dwarves realize that the words were formed by pink bees and that Bian, Inhel, and Wicca were trying to contact them. The three dwarves on the outside see that the dwarf slaves noticed their message, and Bian instructs the bees to form the next message, which explains that they have been tricked. This message greatly confuses the dwarf slaves, and the overseers start to get angry at them for not working. Just then, the pink bees' final message forms, ordering them to fight. The dwarf slaves, though not entirely sure what is going on, know that their friends would never lie to them and start attacking the overseers.\nMeanwhile, Cavendish, Luffy, Law, and Kyros (the latter of whom is unseen to the former three) ride on Farul toward a wall behind which are the Doflamingo officers. Luffy is intent on defeating them right away, while Cavendish intends to climb up to the third floor. Suddenly, the two of them notice Kyros sitting behind them, which causes Cavendish to get angry and Luffy to get excited. Kyros says that he had followed the trail that Luffy had made, and an angry Cavendish calls him a stalker and yells at him to get off because Farul cannot hold three people. Luffy tells Kyros that they will be meeting up with Rebecca soon, and the former combatant is shocked and angry to find that his daughter is behind enemy lines. He asks Luffy why he did not stop her, since Rebecca is on Doflamingo's wanted list. Luffy reassures him, saying that Rebecca was with one of his crewmates, and Kyros states that there is only one thing he wants to do: kill Diamante, the man who killed his wife. Luffy asks Kyros if he intends to die, which Kyros denies, and that coupled with Cavendish's pleas for one of them to get off his horse cause them to take their eyes off the path. Before they know it, they are in the midst of the Colosseum combatants\u2014Donquixote agents battle.\nThe arrival of Luffy causes the Colosseum fighters to become more organized in their attacks, surprising the Donquixote agents. The fighters unanimously agree to hold off the Donquixote agents in order to get Luffy, Cavendish, and Kyros to Doflamingo.",

Usopp had signaled the other member of The Straw Hat Pirates (in the previous episode) with one of his sling shot bombs. But Billions from the Baroque Works had found them instead. To distract them, Usopp uses a chalkboard and drags his nails down it to make a loud noise; he grabs Vivi and runs away.\nMeanwhile, Luffy finds where Crocodile, Nefertari Cobra, and the critically injured Nico Robin is. Crocodile is upset that Luffy is still alive, no matter how many times he defeats Luffy. Cobra is baffled by who the strange boy is (Luffy). Luffy demands that Crocodile give him back Vivi's country, so Vivi can smile again. Luffy punches Crocodile twice and Crocodile is confused about how he is doing it without water. Luffy was using his blood to touch Crocodile preventing Crocodile from using his powers from the devil fruit. Crocodile takes off a covering from his hook that reveals he has poison in it.\nZoro runs to where the smoke bomb was shot by Usopp. But finds a group of Marines who were with Tashigi. They berate him for having a poor sense of direction and then give him orders on where to go to find the center of the city of Alubarna.\nVivi and Usopp are still running with Baroque Works members chasing them. Tashigi and a few Marine members attack the men chasing Vivi and Usopp. Nami and Tony Tony Chopper find Vivi and Usopp with two minutes left before the bomb kills the Royal Army and Rebel Army and everyone in the center of Alubarna. Pell is shot from the sky by a mysterious frog woman hidden in the Clock Tower who is later revealed to be working for Baroque Works.\nLuffy and Crocodile continue their fight and Luffy dodges Crocodile's attacks made by his hook. Cobra notices that Crocodile is struggling in the fight.\nVivi is looking for Pell thinking he's their only hope to reach the cannon in time. Sanji and Zoro are in the Clock Tower. With 30 seconds left, the Clock Tower opens with Mr. 7 and Miss Father's Day inside laughing.",

Usopp and Nami watch without knowing Jabra was with them watching Zoro and Kaku fight. Usopp, offers to fight Jabra, but Jabra declines and drops the key for Usopp to take. Usopp, falling for his tricks tries to pick up the key but is blown away by an attack from Jabra. Nami runs over to the injured Usopp and sees if he is alright. Usopp tries to attack Jabra, and it seems to have hit him, but Jabra appears right behind Usopp, strikes him, and hits him with a barrage-like attack.

Luffy is thrown at crates when trying to attack Lucci who but blocks all of his attacks. Luffy confidently stands back up, despite being exhausted.

Luffy confirms this and tells them his name. A bifurcation is in their way and Nami tells everyone to follow her, but Luffy goes the other way, as he was watching his brother fight. The Straw Hats arrive at the ship and carry all the supplies, only to notice that Luffy is missing. Luffy is sitting on the barrel he was carrying in an alley, but he does not know where his crew went. Ace greets him from the top of a house in the alley and then comes down. They start arm wrestling on top of the barrel Luffy was sitting on, but after struggling, the barrel breaks and the water inside it scatters. They both agree that they are equally strong. Ace invites Luffy and his crew to join the Whitebeard Pirates, but Luffy declines.\nOn Smoker's ship, Mr. 11 is left alone, tied to the mast. Some Billions get on the deck and Mr. 11 asks them to untie him. They explain that as Billions, they are candidates to be promoted to Officer Agents. Mr. 11 asks them to untie him again, but they shoot him. The Billions get off the ship and someone informs them that Fire Fist Ace is in the town. One of them then comments that if they take down Ace, they will surely be promoted to Officer Agents.\nLuffy and Ace start searching for Luffy's crew, but as they walk, Billions start to surround them without being noticed. After they are gathered, everyone comes out. Luffy and Ace do not care what they say and keep walking but the Billions start a fight. After Luffy sends the leader flying with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, one of the Billions tells his comrades not to be scared by that, and everyone keeps chasing them again. Luffy spots his ship and stretches his arms in order to reach for it. He enters the ship ramming towards Sanji and Chopper. Ace reaches the ship in his boat, but then they spot five Billions ships coming towards them. Ace tells Luffy that he can handle them, gets in his boat, and starts propelling it with the help of his flames. He then jumps over a ship and when he lands, he launches a Hiken, destroying the five ships consecutively.\nSmoker is talking to Tashigi and asks what Nefertari Vivi was doing with the Straw Hats. Tashigi proposes that perhaps she was a hostage to a major scheme, but Smoker does not think so. He thinks that is unlikely since she was getting along with the group as if she was one of them. He says that something big is going to occur and that he may know where they are heading after Luffy told him he only wanted to beat Crocodile. Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper in the Going Merry are toasting for Ace joining the Straw Hats, but Ace tells them he is not joining them. After that, he explains that he is in search for Blackbeard after he killed one of his crewmates. He also explains that he is heading to Yuba, and Nami tells him that they are going to the same place. Vivi proceeds to explain the route and after that, they toast for having a fun time together.",

Chopper, running scared, is actually being chased by the Divine Soldiers, but they encounter a Shandia and ignore Chopper and fight one another. Robin, still at the ruins, is approached by a Divine Soldier who tells her to go this route leading to God's shrine. Robin, upset at the Divine Soldier for breaking some part of the ruins, defeats him.\nZoro, still making his way through the forest, is attacked by a Shandia warrior and Zoro punches him, knocking him out. In that moment, Braham defeats a Divine Soldier and proceeds to fight Zoro. Zoro initially tried to ignore the fight since Braham was not a priest. However, when Braham's attacks continued, Zoro prepared to fight him saying that he is glad Braham is not a second-rate flunkie. The Shandia and the Divine Soldiers are now engaged in battle and so are Braham and Zoro. Zoro was initially having problems fighting Braham because of the Jet Skis and Flash Guns that Braham has, thus making it a long-range battle. As the battle continues, Zoro decides to try his new technique. With Ittoryu - Sanjuroku Pound Ho, Zoro was able to defeat Braham and commented to himself about accepting the survival game.\nChopper, wailing about being left by the others, finds himself at the ruins and congratulates himself on being smart. Meanwhile, Gedatsu was in the same area and Chopper did not notice him. Luffy and Wyper continue their face-off and Wyper was shooting cannons at Luffy which Luffy rebounded using his Gomu Gomu no Mi abilities. Enel has visited the Straw Hats' ship and Sanji attempted at attacking but was defeated by Enel's Goro Goro no Mi abilities.

Vivi explains that according to Crocodile, within ten minutes, a huge cannon will be fired, and once the cannon is fired, no one within a five-kilometer radius will survive, wiping out both the Rebel and Royal Army forces. Zoro tells them that they need to find the cannon and stop the cannoneer from shooting. Before they can go ahead and look for the cannon, some Baroque Works Billions find Vivi and try to bring her to Crocodile for a promotion. Sanji and Zoro volunteer to stay behind to deal with the agents while the others go ahead and split up to look for the cannon.\nCrocodile is still laughing at Luffy's statement, telling him that it will not be so easy to defeat him, since he is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy is unimpressed and says that if Crocodile is one of the Seven Warlords, then he is the eighth Warlord. Cobra cannot believe what he is hearing and is impressed by Luffy's confidence. He asks who Luffy is, and Miss All Sunday tells him that he is the one responsible for bringing Vivi back to Arabasta.\nEven though Luffy has figured out how to land a punch on Crocodile, the Warlord is still confident stating that even though Luffy can hit him, he can still absorb any fluid in Luffy's body. He proceeds to dehydrate Luffy's arm, which Luffy counters by drinking more water. The two continue their battle and Luffy reveals that he was planning to throw the barrel of water he was carrying to douse Crocodile in water. Crocodile predicts this move and counters it by conjuring a twister of sand, sending both Luffy and the barrel flying away. Luffy barely catches the barrel of water. Crocodile laughs at Luffy, telling him that this battle is no different from the first time they fought. Luffy proceeds to drink the whole barrel of water he was carrying and dubs himself as Water Luffy, showing a bloated stomach full of water, which shocks both Crocodile and Cobra and amuses Miss All Sunday.\nCobra attacks Luffy but Luffy squirts out water from his mouth and douses Crocodile with water, just as he planned, making the Warlord susceptible to Luffy's physical attacks. Luffy uses his Gomu Gomu no Bazooka technique and hits Crocodile directly to his stomach which sends him crashing. Crocodile is lying on the ground, not moving. Miss All Sunday removes the stakes impaling Cobra and demands that he show her the way to the Poneglyph. Cobra asks what she wants with it, but she subdues him and reiterates her demand.\nCrocodile gets up and calls Miss All Sunday by her real name, Nico Robin, telling her that she should get going now to the Poneglyphs. As Nico Robin and the King leave, Crocodile uses his Ground Secco technique which dehydrates all of their surroundings turning it to a desert wasteland. Luffy shoots water at Crocodile which he simply absorbs with his hand. He continues to suck the moisture out of ground, the effects of which are felt throughout the palace.\nWith eight minutes left until the explosion, Vivi, Pell and the rest of the Straw Hats scramble to find the cannon.\nMeanwhile, Cobra asks if Nico Robin is truly Miss All Sunday's name. He remembers that the name was known throughout the world twenty years ago. On their way to the Poneglyphs, they encounter Tashigi and a bunch of Marines. Tashigi refuses to let them pass, but Robin uses her abilities to incapacitate some of her men. Seeing the ability, a Marine recognizes who she is and tells Tashigi that twenty years ago, when she was eight years old, Robin earned a bounty of 79,000,000 for sinking six Marine ships, classifying her as a first-degree risk. After the incident, she was said to have vanished and never heard from again. After hearing about her reputation, Tashigi commands her men to go to the Palace Square to stop the explosion, deeming it useless for so many men to fight against someone with her power. She stays behind, deciding to fight her, but Robin uses her ability against Tashigi and easily defeats her.\nIn the palace, the entire lawn has turned to sand. Crocodile is able to sneak up on Luffy and grab him by the neck. Luffy spits water at Crocodile but misses and he proceeds to absorb all of the water in Luffy's body, dehydrating him. Luffy's signature straw hat is shown to be blown away by the wind. While still holding Luffy by the neck, Crocodile declares that Luffy has lost to him for the second time.",

However, still needing \"excitement,\" Queen fires another round of Excite Bullets into the crowd.\nThe Straw Hats are now cornered by infected oni. Chopper deduces that Queen must have created an antibody to cure the virus, so he must acquire it from him to develop a cure. Queen announces that the virus will kill its victims in an hour at most. Apoo tries to escape the live floor but he finds that the gates are locked.\nQueen introduces a game he calls \"Ice Oni Tag\"; he gives a vial containing the only sample of the antibody to Apoo. The people must fight desperately for the antibody or else they would inevitably become infected themselves. The Straw Hats must win this game and acquire the sample to cure everyone. Queen performs an alternate version of his funk dance, with sadistic lyrics celebrating the bloodsport. He then begins the game, and Apoo is chased by the crowd for the vial.\nOn the rooftop, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi attack Kaidou but they are struck down with his spiked club, and they lose their Sulong forms.\nIn the right brain tower, Yamato decides to aid Shinobu. He reveals that he attended Oden's execution and heard Shinobu's speech. Sasaki's forces bombard Yamato with cannons, but he endures the barrage. Apologizing for not saving Momonosuke from the burning castle twenty years ago, Yamato introduces himself as Oden.",

Luffy stops Cavendish, saying that Law is his friend, which Law loudly denies. Luffy asks Cavendish if he still hates him, to which Cavendish replies no due to Usopp rescuing him from being a toy. Cavendish then hands Law his hat, which he found in front of the Colosseum, and offers to put it on for him, which Law quickly declines. Cavendish then tells Luffy that as repayment for rescuing him, he'll kill Doflamingo so the Straw Hat Pirates can hide. Luffy declines the offer, saying he has to defeat Doflamingo to repay Rebecca for giving him lunch, leading Law and Cavendish to question his motives. Cavendish believes Luffy wants to defeat Doflamingo to become more popular and gain the press' attention.\nSuddenly, Chinjao, Sai, and Boo appear, their grudge against Luffy gone, and now they are ready to defeat Doflamingo to repay Usopp, which annoys Luffy due to him wanting to defeat Doflamingo. Hajrudin then appears, getting rid of his grudge and saying he'll defeat Doflamingo. He is soon followed by Elizabello II, Dagama, Abdullah, Jeet, Suleiman, Orlumbus, Ideo, and Blue Gilly, who all want the same thing: Doflamingo's head, but for different reasons. As Zoro asks all of them to back them up, Luffy and the former combatants start arguing about who gets to defeat Doflamingo. However, they notice a crowd of former Colosseum combatant toys heading toward them, ready to take Luffy, Zoro, and Law's bounties, and, forgetting their argument and disgusted at them for going after the very people who were responsible for their freedom, easily defeat the ex-toys. Just then, Luffy sees Ucy in the crowd, and the bull quickly recognizes his friend.\nThe citizens of Dressrosa are all searching for Luffy, Zoro, and Law, expecting them to be dead. Suddenly, they see the shadow of a bull heading toward them, and thinking it is only the Straw Hats, they prepare to fire their guns. However, they see the Straw Hats backed up by the Corrida Colosseum's most dangerous combatants and are shocked. Pica then prepares to crush the combatants, but Chinjao uses his drill head, and Elizabello II uses a lighter version of King Punch to shatter Pica's stone arm, shocking the citizens.

However, Sanji refuses to even consider that Luffy lost, getting angry at the samurai for thinking that they might have lost.\nBack on the Live Floor, Queen has gotten the upper hand against Chopper, and Perospero continues to bombard the samurai with arrows. They encourage everybody to give up fighting, and Queen is about to bite Chopper; however, he's stopped by Sanji. Sanji's kick is hard enough to send Queen's head spinning, causing him to intercept all of Perospero's arrows as well as send Perospero himself flying. He congratulates Chopper for holding off Queen enough for him to arrive, and tells him to continue trusting in Luffy, before handing him Zoro and telling to take care of the injured swordsman. Sanji resolves to fight Queen, and the samurai look on in awe, noting how he doesn't give up despite his captain having been defeated.\nMeanwhile, above the first floor, Kaidou easily defeats Kin'emon. Despite his injuries, Kin'emon continues to stand up and stab Kaidou, allowing Shinobu and Momonosuke time to run. As he struggles, Kin'emon thinks back to when they were sent to the present day. He thinks back to when he and Momonosuke pretended to be father and son, and encourages him to continue living. However, he is stabbed again by Kaidou, collapsing to the floor.\nAs Shinobu and Momonosuke run, he also thinks back to his time with Kin'emon. He resolves himself to tell the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance members that Luffy isn't dead, and speaks into one of the Marys, announcing it across the island.

Enel, upset at Usopp, takes him out with his Goro Goro no Mi. Enel then told Gan Fall that the Divine Squad members, who he seized six years ago, have been working long and hard till this day without rest. He also told Gan Fall that his need for Sky Island is also complete. Enel stated that the people of Skypiea are ignorant in seeing the Upper Yard as only a land of Vearth. He stated that the Straw Hats, his crew and the Shandia all seek the City of Gold.\nAfter his discussion with Gan Fall, Enel left saying he is also a partaker in the final game and responded to Gan Fall's inquiry about his Divine Squad leaving Enel's forced labor as \"something only God knows\". At that moment, Hotori and Kotori, both of whom are brothers of Satori, appeared with the intention of avenging their brother's death. While still engaged in their battle, Luffy tells Wyper that cannons and rifles will not work on him. Wyper, seeing the statement as being true adds a Flavor Dial and his weapon becomes the Burn Bazooka. Luffy and Wyper battle for some time and eventually throw each other off after both launching a Bazooka-like attack on each other. Wyper thought it would be better not to kill Luffy and save his energy to kill Enel. Just as Luffy answers him, Luffy is swallowed by the Giant Python, leaving Wyper to wonder where Luffy had gone.\nGenbo and the Divine Soldiers battle and he easily overwhelms them. Yama then appears before Genbo. Genbo shoots an iron cannonball at Yama, which he dodges and kicks the iron cannonball back and damages Genbo. Genbo, refusing to be defeated, makes Yama launch the Ten-Fold Axe: Axe Mountain attack on Genbo and defeats him.\nWhile on the Going Merry, Nami and Gan Fall prepare for their battle with Kotori and Hotori.

Meanwhile, some pirates, citizens, and a gorilla are tied up, begging to be untied so they can escape the cage. On the King's Plateau, Viola, Usopp, Zoro, Hack, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro react to the shrinking Birdcage, and near the Corrida Colosseum, the recently freed prisoner gladiators are shocked to find that after being freed from their prison, they are still being held captive. Below the King's Plateau, Riku curses Doflamingo for his destruction as a citizen near him begins losing hope. The fighters on the second and fourth levels of the palace plateau react to the shrinking cage as Robin looks up to the palace, and on the King's Plateau, Usopp begs Luffy to beat Doflamingo while Kin'emon realizes that everyone's lives are now dependent on Luffy.\nOn the palace rooftop, Doflamingo says that he will save nobody and that people who knew the country's secret should not be allowed to live. Meanwhile, as the citizens run toward the center of town, Sabo runs in the opposite direction. Doflamingo mockingly tells Luffy that he and all his friends would die just like Bellamy and Law already had, and Dressrosa would perish, though Doflamingo could just build another country. Luffy then rushes toward Doflamingo, saying he could stop that if he beat the Shichibukai, and Doflamingo hurls strings at him. Luffy dodges the strings and barrages Doflamingo with Haki-enhanced punches, but Doflamingo sends him hurtling to the ground with Fulbright. Luffy gets up, rushes toward Doflamingo again, and prepares an attack. Doflamingo prepares to shoot him, when Law suddenly switches places with Luffy and stabs an astonished Doflamingo with Gamma Knife.\nLaw tells Doflamingo that this attack will destroy him from the inside out as Doflamingo coughs up blood, shocking Trebol. Trebol asks Law how he is still alive and how he used an Ope Ope no Mi attack without creating a ROOM. Law reveals that he already made a ROOM which encompassed the entire palace plateau and was too large for them to see, at the cost of his lifespan. Law recalls how he was shot by Doflamingo, but the wound was not fatal. He then switched himself with a fallen Donquixote Pirate on the level below, and switched back after Doflamingo finished shooting his body double. When Luffy discovered his body, Law revealed that he was still alive and that he had a plan.\nThe Gamma Knife causes Doflamingo to sink to his knees, and a shocked Trebol tells him that a king should never be on their knees. However, an angered Doflamingo grabs Law's face and prepares to shoot him, though Law accepts it since Doflamingo will still die. However, Luffy arrives and kicks Doflamingo in the face with Gear Second, sending the Shichibukai flying and landing backfirst in a pile of rubble. Law then remembers how he met Corazon and how Corazon fought to save his life. Luffy races toward Doflamingo, but Law stops him, saying it was his job to finish the Shichibukai off. After struggling to drag himself to Doflamingo, Law stands up and creates a ROOM, ready to deal the finishing blow.",

Pedro fights Hiyoko and manages to defeat this form, but before Hiyoko regenerates into a stronger form, Pedro lights a string of bombs and attempts to take out all the surrounding enemies in a massive explosion. In the Room of Treasure, Brook's sword is unable to pierce Big Mom's skin, and he is finally defeated, but not before managing to injure Prometheus. Outside the room, Smoothie hears about Luffy's breakout and orders the floors below them to be blocked off so Big Mom does not find out.

Pudding asks Big Mom if they can talk in the latter's room.\nBelow, Luffy fights against Charlotte Cadenza in his race to find Sanji, and knocks out the pirate after choking him for Sanji's location.

        "long_summary": "After he is cut in half, a giant yolk flies out of Baron Tamago's body. To his surprise, the seemingly victorious Pedro watches as the yolk reforms into a different version of Tamago, who is covered in yellow, possesses a chicken beak and wings, and wields two daggers. The Big Mom Pirates around them cheer on as Tamago's new form, Viscount Hiyoko, attacks Pedro while making clucking noises. Hiyoko is an improved swordfighter, and he barrages Pedro with rapid attacks that the jaguar mink has trouble keeping up with them. Hiyoko goes so fast that he becomes a whirlwind of motion, and manages to knock Pedro's sword and send it flying a good distance away. Pedro races to his sword, and Hiyoko rapidly pursues him, but Pedro retrieves it in the nick of time and cuts Hiyoko in half, sending the yolk out of his body once again. Hiyoko's crewmates cheer at the impending evolution, revealing that he will turn into Count Niwatori with the power of the Tama Tama no Mi, which allows him to evolve each time he is destroyed. They claim Niwatori to be a \"true knight\" who will surely overpower Pedro. However, Pedro decides to attack him in the midst of the evolution, much to the shock of the Big Mom Pirates. They charge at him, but he pulls out a string of bombs that he promptly lights, sending them fleeing in fear. Pedro then sets off a massive explosion that sends the pirates and Count Niwatori flying, and seemingly engulfs himself.\nIn the Room of Treasure, Brook is near his limit against Big Mom, but mounts a charge in order to complete his task. Big Mom has Zeus and Prometheus attack him, but Brook withstands their lightning and fire as he spins past them in a fiery blaze and strikes Big Mom with his sword. However, to his shock, his attack has only pressed Big Mom's skin a little bit without penetrating it. Big Mom then retaliates by smacking him into the ground, and Brook is left unable to get up. However, as Zeus and Prometheus attack him some more, he unleashes an attack while lying down, which manages to cut Prometheus despite the homie being made of fire. Big Mom then finishes off Brook by smashing him into the wall, and as she captures him, Smoothie hears about Luffy rampaging through the castle as she stands outside the room. Knowing that Big Mom would not react kindly to more events threatening the wedding tomorrow, and that she might take it out on them, Smoothie orders her subordinates to bar off the entrance to the fourth level from all the levels below, and to deal with the problem without telling Big Mom.\nInside the room, Brook is stripped, and the Chess Soldiers do not find any stolen objects in his clothes. This lightens Big Mom's mood around Brook as she coddles him as her new pet, and she commends him for overpowering her Chess Soldiers. However, she reveals that he was unable to overpower her special homies, Zeus, Prometheus, and Napoleon, because they were made with pieces of her own soul. She is relieved that he was not trying to steal the Poneglyphs, revealing that Gol D. Roger managed to sneak in and read them with his ability to hear the Voice of All Things, allowing him to reach Laugh Tale. She planned to become the next Pirate King, as she now had a key to be able to hear the Voice of All Things as well. Pudding then enters the room, and Big Mom asks her if she has awakened her third eye's ability yet. The exasperated Pudding states that it may be impossible due to her being a half-breed, and Big Mom says that the third eye is just an ugly feature on her if it cannot be useful. Brook is surprised to hear of Pudding's third eye, and the two of them spot and recognize each other. Pudding, surprised that Brook got here, asks Big Mom if they can talk privately in her quarters.\nMeanwhile, Luffy continues fighting his way through the Whole Cake Chateau to get to Sanji. He runs into Charlotte Cadenza, who is intent on stopping him. Recognizing Cadenza as one of the two fighters who defeated him in the battle outside Sweet City, Luffy attacks him, but Cadenza manages to stand his ground with his Armament Haki. However, when Cadenza attacks, Luffy gets behind him and puts him in a chokehold, ordering the pirate to tell him where Sanji is. However, Cadenza refuses to say, causing him to pass out. Meanwhile, Reiju pleads with Sanji to leave the infirmary, saying that the Germa are nothing but warmongers trying to reclaim the past and they deserve to be erased from history. Even though she has this view, she accepts her death as well, since she was programmed to be forced to obey her father's commands and was guilty of partaking in the Germa's actions. However, she wants Sanji to live on with his conscience and return to his home with the Straw Hats. Reiju believes that since Big Mom wants Germa's technology, it is unlikely she will target Zeff. With Sanji still not leaving, Reiju then reveals that she replaced the exploding cuffs on his wrists with fakes, which will allow him to return to Luffy without fear of repercussions. As Luffy fights several Big Mom Pirates who came to attack him after Cadenza's defeat, Sanji gains his resolve.",

The Franky Family shows up, pleading with Luffy to let them help out, because they'll do anything for their leader, and Luffy agrees to let them come.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy wants to depart right away to Enies Lobby even though the Aqua Laguna is hitting the island. He asks Paulie if there's a ship he could borrow to get them there, or better yet, a sea train. Paulie informs them that the sea train was built by a team headed by a legendary shipwright and there's nothing else like it in existence in the world and if they were to set out, they would immediately get killed so they would do better to wait until morning.\nAt that moment Nami remembers reading about Enies Lobby and the Gates of Justice - a set of large steel gates beyond which people only find despair. Enies Lobby is known as the Judicial Island and has a judicial court located on it. However, it functions as such in name only; if you're taken to Enies Lobby, you're already considered guilty. Beyond the Gates of Justice lie two locations, one is the Marine Headquarters and the other is Impel Down - an undersea prison reserved for the criminals who once ran amok in the world. Robin, who has a bounty on her head, would only suffer pain once she crossed those doors.\nPaulie tells them that they shouldn't go there because they are pirates too and would get caught. Luffy declares he is going and he would steal a ship to get there. Paulie and Luffy are about to fight, when Kokoro stops them and asks Luffy to follow her if they didn't fear death.\nSanji gets to the railcar where Franky and Usopp are tied up and after defeating all the officers inside, Sanji and Franky get into an argument that Usopp unsuccessfully tries to stop. There are several Den Den Mushi there which Sanji plans to use to call Nami. But the argument is loud enough that Captain T Bone who is in the next car is alerted and draws his sword to check the commotion.\nKokoro leads Luffy, Zoro and Chopper to the unused sea train, Rocketman. It is a sea train which wasn't used because its speed couldn't be controlled. Iceburg is already at the train and has serviced it and filled it with coal enough to last the trip. After he is thanked by Luffy, Iceburg tells him that he can thank him later if he isn't killed by the train ride.\nNami comes there bringing with her the two conductors who are carting in meat and drinks, and both Zoro and Luffy dig in and thank her. While he is eating, the Franky Family members come in and beg Luffy to be let to ride with them to go and rescue Franky. While Nami opposes, Luffy just tells them to get in; however, they would ride on king bulls and need only hold on to the train as it went.\nThe gang get on and the train is ready to depart with Kokoro piloting the Rocketman as she tells Iceburg to rest up, and that Franky would be okay, as he got hit by a Sea Train and survived. Paulie also sneaks onboard the train as it is leaving while Luffy gets on top of the train and holds on. He yells that they are going to get everything back as the train departs.",

Luffy then finally recognizes that man responsible for beating up Usopp and calls out to Franky wanting to fight.\nBack at the hospital, Kalifa informs the others of the Galley-La Company that Iceburg is now awake but still badly injured and can go into his room to see him. Paulie informs Iceburg that he and the rest of the company will watch over the shipyard until he recovers. Iceburg then immediately tells the others that he remembers who attacked him and says that one of them was with the Straw Hat Pirates indicating Nico Robin. Outside, the people are excited to hear that Iceburg is awake.\nBack at the shipyard, Franky taunts Luffy about attacking his gang and destroying his house. Nami only wants their money back but Franky says that he has already spent it. However, Luffy doesn't care about the money and wants revenge. The people suddenly start to move away as Franky suddenly starts taking in a large amount of air. Franky then suddenly lets out a large amount of fire that nearly hits Luffy, Nami, and the other Water 7 citizens. Nami assumes that Franky has Devil Fruit powers and Franky suddenly leaps into the water much to the confusion of Luffy and Nami. Franky then suddenly crashes into the boat sending Luffy and Nami into the air and Franky says that he hasn't ate a Devil Fruit. As Luffy falls toward Franky, Franky launches his Strong Right move right at Luffy sending him flying across the water, into the wall, and downward right on the top of his head. Franky moves onto shore as the other people run away and Nami wonders if Franky doesn't have Devil Fruit powers, then what is he. Franky then takes off his hand saying he's actually a human with robotic parts, also known as a cyborg.\nBack at the Galley-La Company, Paulie is confused and shocked to hear that one of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Kalifa confirms this and says that she had Lucci contact the government for more information. Hattori then says that Robin is a notorious criminal and is no surprise that she will do something so sadistic. Kaku then says that the next thing to do is to find the Straw Hats and Lulu wonders if they did this because they wouldn't fix their ship. However, Kaku sums up that the Straw Hats are responsible and must be dealt with. At a different location, Sanji and Tony Tony Chopper are sailing on a boat still looking for Robin. Chopper is still worried about the large wave that will sink Water 7 underwater but Sanji remembers that Chopper left something behind on the Merry. Sanji then turns around much to the excitement of Chopper.\nAt the Galley-La Company, Tilestone charges into the room loudly excited to hear that Iceburg is awake (much to the disdain of the others due to Tilestone's loud yelling). Annoyed, Paulie knocks Tilestone out of the room telling him to keep it down as Iceburg needs the silence to recover. Tilestone then apologizes and then tells Paulie that Luffy and Franky are fighting and destroying the entire shipyard in the process. Paulie is clearly angered by this and Hattori says that at least they know where to find him. Paulie then leads the other members of the Galley-La out to confront Luffy and Kalifa informs Iceburg that now he has peace and quiet. At the shipyard, Luffy and Franky continue to brawl as they wreck the shipyard as they fight. Luffy launches his Gomu Gomu Pistol which sends Franky flying backwards and Franky retaliates with a giant blast (Weapons Left). Luffy dodges the attack and attempts to counter back with a kick but Franky blocks it. Suddenly, both Franky and Luffy are suddenly punched backwards and it was revealed to be by Galley-La. The people are excited to see them and Luffy is just as confused to why they attacked him. Franky warns Galley-La not to interfere with his fight with Luffy but Galley-La simply ignores him and Paulie questions Luffy. Paulie then uses Rope Action on Luffy and slams him onto the ground (Rope Action: Haafu-Notto Ea Doribu). Franky yells out in frustration about Galley-La attacking Luffy, but the other Galley-La members prepare for a fight. Lulu then fires shots at Luffy who absorbs it due to his Devil Fruit powers and Lulu then roughly kicks Luffy onto the ground. Franky then starts to fire at Galley-La and Kaku falls down from above. Franky attempts to blast him but Tilestone knocks him away with a giant log. Kaku then grabs Franky and slams him onto the ground. Meanwhile, Luffy is in a fist fight with Lucci who eventually knocks him backward with his hand. Luffy still doesn't understand why Galley-La is attacking him and Paulie says that one of the members of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Back in the hospital room, Iceburg is remembering that one of the attackers was indeed Nico Robin and wonders if the masked man is also with the Straw Hats. He also wonders that they are after something important and, outside, the people heard that the Straw Hats are to blame for the attempted murder and are said to capture the Straw Hat Pirates.",

        "long_summary": "The Straw Hat Pirates, Franky, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe leap into the sea to find the Going Merry waiting for them. It takes a moment for the Marines of the Buster Call to realize what's happening. As the rope ladder seemingly drops on its own, Sanji and Nami climb aboard. As Zoro carries Chimney and Gonbe up with him, Franky brings Usopp, and Kokoro tosses Luffy, Robin, and Chopper aboard before climbing on, Sanji starts wondering how the Merry got here and who threw down the rope ladder. Many of the Straw Hats are choking back emotion at being back aboard their ship. Even Franky is wondering just how she got here after being dumped from his hideout by CP9. Luffy tries to thank Robin for getting him out of the tower, but a Fleur covers his mouth. Instead it is Robin who thanks everyone for saving her even when she felt she wasn't worth saving. In the emotional exchange, Chopper regains his ability to move. The Straw Hats soon organize and make plans to escape Enies Lobby.\nSpandam is livid and orders all guns on the Merry, even if it means killing Robin. Spandam justifies it (falsely) as orders from Aokiji that Robin is to be killed if she cannot be captured. But when the cannons fire, the shot miss the Merry and hit each other instead. Then, two of the ships crash into each other. Eventually, the Marines discover the reason for their loss of control: the Gates of Justice are closing, meaning the whirlpool currents are returning. Usopp then realizes this was the reason for Sanji's absence earlier. He had been in the third tower looking for the gates' operating lever. Thanks to his thinking ahead, they now have a fighting chance.\nAs the Merry speeds along, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, and Franky fend off cannonballs from the battleships. Eventually, Luffy crawls his way to the stern using his mouth and insists he join in the fight. Eventually, Zoro and Sanji decide to quiet him by stretching his body like a net and using him to catch and return a large salvo of the cannonballs. Eventually, Nami computes a course along the whirlpool currents, allowing them to outrace the cannonballs. Spandam goes into a tirade over how the mightiest force in the world can't defeat one pirate crew and capture one woman. The tirade eventually stops when the \"hands\" of Nico Robin envelop him and begin to bend him backwards. After all the physical and mental abuse he had inflicted upon her, everyone knew what was coming. With a final, cathartic, \"Clutch!\", Spandam's spine snaps in two and Robin gets her revenge. Nami then directs Franky to finish their escape. With apologies to the crew and ship, Franky fires his Coup de Vent, launching the Merry clear of the whirlpools, the Buster Call, and Enies Lobby altogether. A final Smoke Star from Usopp ensures they cannot pursue.\nMeanwhile, back at the Enies Lobby Front Gate, Zambai, Paulie, and the rest of the invasion force have boarded Puffing Tom and are starting their way back to Water 7. Lulu and Tilestone reflect on what's just happened while Mozu and Kiwi appreciatively cuddle up to Paulie in spite of his protests: resulting in a massive nosebleed from him. Everyone is in high spirits as in spite of bumps, bruises, and broken bones, they have taken on the World Government and made it out alive.\nEventually, Admiral Aokiji makes his way to Enies Lobby personally. The Buster Call is adamant in pursuing the Straw Hats, but Aokiji firmly orders everyone to stand down. There is no way to salvage the day now. The Buster Call is supposed to comprise a force equivalent to that of an entire country, yet their current situation is anything but proud and strong. Two ships are sunk, several more are severely damaged. And Enies Lobby stands a smoldering ruin: one of the great strongholds of the entire World Government destroyed. Something this catastrophic cannot be disguised or sugar-coated. The World Government has suffered a complete and utter defeat this day.\nAt his insistence, Kokoro positions Luffy at his customary position atop the Merry's figurehead. Luffy thanks Merry for coming to their rescue. He also thanks Franky for helping out. Franky has to appreciate the sheer audacity of the Straw Hats and cautions the World Government will be coming after them with a fervor now, but the Straw Hats don't care. To them, saving their friend was more important than defying the World Government and in this most important regard, they have won.",

He pledges to the escapees: that there is no way he'd allow their escape, only to get stomped down by the arrival of Marshall D. Teach.

Luffy actually seems to pose no threat but all the while, he remembers what great friends they used to be, sailing together on the same ship. Even after taking a harsh beating, Luffy defeats Usopp. Luffy and the crew then leave Usopp and the ship behind.",
        "long_summary": "As promised, Usopp returns to Scrap Island at 10pm for the duel with Luffy. Luffy tells him not to have any regrets regardless of the outcome. Usopp replies that, unlike previous enemies, he is well aware of what Luffy is capable of, and is ready to defeat him. He tells Luffy to come at him with everything he has. The rest of the Straw Hat Pirates watch from the deck of the Going Merry with varying degrees of concern.\nUsopp starts with some of the boasts he made when they first met. When Luffy comes at him with Gomu Gomu no Pistol, Usopp uses his Hissatsu Ketchup Boshi to fake coughing up blood. This stops Luffy in his tracks out of concern. Usopp mocks him for showing pity on the enemy, and blinds him with a Flash Dial, then hits him with Hissatsu Tamago Boshi, pelting his former captain with rotten eggs. Luffy tells Usopp to get serious; Usopp says he is, reminding him that this is how he fights. Usopp shoots Hissatsu Tabasco Boshi right in Luffy's mouth, making him spit fire and fall back right onto a pile of caltrops, scratching up his body. When Luffy gets up, Usopp knocks him back down with Hissatsu Koshou Boshi, which explodes in a cloud of ground pepper. Luffy coughs in fits and repeatedly lands in the caltrops.\nLuffy recovers enough to finally get out of the caltrops, remarking how much it hurts. Usopp says he will not give Luffy a chance to retaliate, and starts to amp up the danger with Shuriken Ryuuseigun, firing strings of throwing stars at Luffy, forcing him to focus on dodging. He gets in an area that appears to be smoky. Usopp says it is actually gas coming from a Breath Dial, but he could not smell it because of the rotten eggs. Usopp fires Kaen Boshi, setting off a tremendous explosion that throws Going Merry back from the shore. For a moment, Luffy lays on the ground and thinks about the past with Usopp. The water thrown up by the explosion makes it look like the ship itself is crying.\nUsopp remarks he knows that explosion would not kill Luffy. Luffy tries to attack with Gomu Gomu no Gatling, but Usopp responds with Sakuretsu Saboteso Boshi, which explodes on Luffy's fist and pummels Luffy with small pins. Usopp fires several Sanren Kayaku Boshi at Luffy, forcing him to dodge the resulting explosions. Luffy finally knocks Usopp back with Gomu Gomu no Pistol. But when he tries Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, Usopp catches it with an Impact Dial and dishes it back out on Luffy, knocking Luffy back, but also injuring his arm with the recoil. That was the last of Usopp's tricks. Out of ideas, he stands there and takes it as Luffy fires Gomu Gomu no Bullet, punching him hard in the chest and knocking him out, winning the duel.\nPutting his straw hat back on, Luffy tells Usopp that he can keep the Going Merry, and bids him goodbye. Chopper wants to treat him, but Sanji stops him, saying it is wrong to show pity on the loser of a duel. Chopper still leaves some supplies for him to help treat himself. As he returns to the ship, Luffy tears up, commenting on the heavy burden. Zoro responds that it is the burden of the captain, and the rest of the crew relies on him to bear it. As Luffy, Chopper, and Nami tear up over this turn of events, the crew then leaves the ship, and a crying Usopp, behind.",

It is revealed that Luffy managed to defeat Bellamy with one hit, and then he screams out Doflamingo's name in anguish. Doflamingo, however, has a shock in store for him.",
        "long_summary": "Hanging off a ledge, Roronoa Zoro recalls his training with Dracule Mihawk, in which the master swordsman informed him that having chips on the blades of his sword is an affront to his honor and that he could prevent this by hardening his blades with Busoshoku Haki. He also forbade Zoro from drinking until he mastered the technique. At the King's Plateau, Fujitora asks his men if there are any wounded, but is informed that his Devil Fruit powers kept them all safe as citizens and combatants around the country react to Pica's defeat. Meanwhile, the SMILE Factory explodes, to the shock of those who can see it. Inside, the dwarves carry tanks of SAD and smash them while proclaiming that they will no longer be taken advantage of. However, Trebol, who is watching, claims that they can still restore the factory and heal Pica because they still have Mansherry.\nAt the Sunflower Fields, Leo and Mansherry meet up with Kyros, Nico Robin, and Rebecca, with Mansherry offering to heal the heavily wounded Kyros. However, Kyros refuses to let Mansherry do this because he believes there is some limit to her powers and that there are those in the country who need such healing more than he does. As Mansherry looks over Dressrosa for the first time, Kyros notes they can only leave Donquixote Doflamingo's defeat to Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar D. Water Law. Below the palace, Koala contacts Sabo and asks him where he is, prompting Sabo to admit he is running a little late because it took some time to free all the prisoners in the Colosseum. He tells Koala there aren't that many things she can do on her own before saying he's coming when Koala says Luffy might be in danger.\nBack at the King's Plateau, Usopp tearfully pulls Zoro up while Kin'emon congratulates him for defeating Pica, but Zoro tells them it is not over yet because the Birdcage is still present, which means Doflamingo is still alive. Back at the palace, Bellamy had defended his decision to attack Luffy at the cost of his life by stating that Doflamingo might remember him this way before punching Luffy into a wall. However, Luffy had pointed out that Doflamingo only wanted Bellamy to be pitted against him and die from the beginning, which Bellamy admitted was likely correct before claiming it is his dying wish to fulfill this. Bellamy then thought back to when he first met Luffy and, after his journey to Sky Island, Bellamy reacted in shock seeing the afterimage in the sky of Luffy. Bellamy told Luffy to just stand there and die if he did not want to fight back before leaping toward him, but Luffy steeled himself and punched Bellamy into the ground with a Busoshoku Haki-hardened punch, defeating Bellamy once more. Luffy screams Doflamingo's name, prompting Doflamingo to note that he hopes Luffy comes up to the roof and sees Law's corpse.",

Blue Gilly questions Ricky as to \"what he is trying to cut, with a dull sword\" while Ricky lies on the ground commenting that he can not win against time, and that he hates the cheers and that he hates Doflamingo. Blue Gilly and Dagama then attack the gladiators that Dagama had bribed into helping him from behind, betraying them, Dagama then tries to double cross Blue Gilly and attack him from behind, but Blue Gilly notices and counters with a kick that knocks Dagama out of the ring and promptly gets attacked by a fighting fish as insult to injury. Blue Gilly knew never to trust a schemer like him and was watching his back the whole time, earning him the praise from the audience.\nMeanwhile Bellamy has been fighting Bartolomeo and is on death's door, been severely outclassed by him, Bellamy then comments that Bartolomeo must have eaten a Devil Fruit. The spectators noticed that Bellamy was mysteriously hurt after he attacked Bartolomeo just like Hack, while Luffy still hanging from a window sill shouts encouragement at Bellamy.\nMeanwhile a group of competitors have ganged up on king Elizabello II, while Blue Gilly taunts him saying that he is now unprotected to which the king retorts back to Blue Gilly with a threat of his own. The crowd is now very curious as to what will happen next, as they have heard about the power of Elizabello's punches, and they decide to run away when he starts preparing to punch. As Elizabello is about to punch, Blue Gilly quickly moves in with the intent to break the king's neck while Bellamy has managed to catch Bartolomeo with his hands, when he felt the power eliminating from the king and turns around to sees in horror that he and Bartolomeo are directly in the path of the punch. With the power channeled in an hour of focus, Elizabello unleashes his punch directly in front of Blue Gilly, breaking the sound barrier and releasing an unstoppable shock wave, destroying anything in its path and sent everyone in the ring flying and out of the fight. The punch alone generated a blinding light that prevents anyone from seeing whats happening. Outside of the colosseum, by passers stop to look at the rising smoke and the loud sound that came from the colosseum. As the smoke clears, the shaken commentator crawled out of the safety of his stand and announces to the audience that every fighter except for Elizabello II had been knocked out.\nBefore he could announce the winner, one of the audience shouts out there is still someone else standing, and the smoke clears revealing a transparent barrier protecting not only the audience from the brunt of the punch but Bartolomeo as well. Bartolomeo then reveals that he ate the Bari Bari no Mi, a devil fruit that allows him to create a barrier when he crosses his fingers, he then attacks Elizabello with a barrier which proves to be powerful enough to injure him and sent him skidding near the edge of the ring. With the last remaining fighter knocked out, the commentator announces Bartolomeo as the winner of the B block battle royale which disappoints the crowd.\nMeanwhile inside the corridor leading to the seats, Thunder Soldier reveals to Franky that he is also planning to destroy the factory. Franky demands to know the location of it but Thunder Soldier tells him they must first free the workers and that their tactic is important as it will bring the fall of Dressrosa. Thunder Soldier then states that if Franky is seriously going to stand up against Doflamingo then he will explain the history of Dressrosa.",

Hancock is so happy that she fell to her knees in a swoon. The nearby Marines mistook this interaction as Luffy throwing his weight on Hancock and defeating her. Hancock then pictures herself marrying Luffy and having the red string of fate tying them to each other, but is soon brought back to reality when Smoker attacks Luffy again, prompting Hancock to break his jitte. Smoker angrily asks her if she knows what will happen for messing with the Marines but she replies that she \"can do everything, because she's beautiful\". Ivankov confronts Donquixote Doflamingo about Bartholomew Kuma being \"dead\". Luffy soon joins Ivankov and Doflamingo explains that while the cyborg is indeed Kuma, he is not the one they once knew, as Dr. Vegapunk has completely modified him, and he is now a complete human weapon, much to Ivankov's surprise.\nDoflamingo then tells Ivankov that Kuma now is just a weapon that follows the World Government's orders and so it is better for him to forget about their friendship. Kuma then shoots beams at Ivankov and Luffy. Kuma then dashes toward the Newkamas and blows them away with his Pad Cannon. Angered, Ivankov attacks him with both Face Spectrum and Galaxy Wink which blows Kuma away, followed by a kick which knocks Kuma down. Ivankov decides that he \"will not hold back anymore\". Just then he becomes depressed at how nobody has ever forgotten about him but quickly recovers claiming that he will make Kuma remember how scary he is.\nHe then orders the Newkamas to follow Luffy while he deals with Kuma. Meanwhile Buggy and his followers formulate a plan that they soon put into action, but Galdino has doubts. Daz Bonez and Crocodile fight the Whitebeard Pirates who try to protect Whitebeard from him, but are easily defeated. Jozu then confronts Crocodile and is capable of harming him. Just before Jozu could attack Crocodile again, Doflamingo saves Crocodile by holding Jozu back with his power. Crocodile threatens to kill Doflamingo if he gets in his way, but Doflamingo proposes an alliance. Luffy keeps advancing, but finds that Mihawk is in his way. Mihawk thinks to himself as he \"apologizes\" to Shanks as he will not hold back and will fight Luffy to determine if fate is on Luffy's side or not.",

        "long_summary": "The episode starts with everyone exclaiming that the Mermaid Princess has been kidnapped. Luffy asks Shirahoshi why she got out of Megalo's mouth, she apologizes and asks him not to get mad at her as she starts to cry. As someone calls Luffy filthy and heartless, Chopper urges Sanji not to turn around. Sanji realizes that Chopper's warning can only mean that the Mermaid Princess is right behind him. Chopper tells him he is correct, but seeing the princess would without a doubt kill him if a normal mermaid made him lose so much blood before.\nAs Sanji begins to get lost in thought, he remembers hearing that even the most beautiful woman in the world, the pirate empress, would pale in comparison, and realizes that his dream is now in his grasp. He then tells Chopper that for the sake of his dreams, he chooses death \u2013 Chopper retorts by exclaiming that he thought that his dream was to find the All Blue. He turns around and looks at her. He realizes that he is gazing upon something that his imagination could never fathom, that no painting could ever capture. He then turns to stone, much to Chopper's shock.\nLuffy is examining Hatchan, trying to get Hachi to tell him who attacked him. Chopper wonders if Sanji turning to stone could be from a side effect of receiving okama blood. Shirahoshi cries and asks Luffy what she should do, but all of a sudden, the locals take action and tie up Luffy, Chopper, Hatchan, and the still petrified Sanji. Luffy asks them what they are doing, and the locals tell him not to underestimate the warriors of Fish-Man Island. One of the locals identifies Hatchan as a former member of Arlong's gang. Shirahoshi tries to explain to everyone that Luffy was only helping her, but the locals will not listen and promise to behead the pirates. Luffy then notices something and tells them that something is flying toward them from behind the crowd, but a local asks Luffy if he really thinks they are dumb enough to fall for that.\nSomeone then notices that Luffy is not lying, and everyone is shocked to see it is none other than Vander Decken IX. Decken yells that he found her, this time saying \"Of course I did\" instead of \"I think\". The locals are shocked that after hiding out for ten years, he now suddenly appeared on the island, and someone yells for Shirahoshi to run for it. Decken tells Shirahoshi to give him an answer, saying she will escape death if she says yes, telling her to run away with him and marry him. The locals are shocked to hear him ask for marriage after constantly attempting to take her life. Shirahoshi tells him she is sorry, but he is not her type.\nThe locals are comically stunned to find out that is why she will not marry him, and not his violent tendencies. Decken is crushed, and actually looks emotionally hurt. He tells her she should be ashamed of herself, because he has had feelings for her for the past ten years and then she steps all over them. He then asks her who she is planning to be with. He goes on to say that now that he knows her feelings toward him, her existence is now an eyesore. He gets ready to attack her as a local tells her to run, but Luffy tells her to wait, having now dubbed her 'scaredy cat'.\nA local grabs him by the collar, and asks him if he is working for Decken, and if he wants the princess to die. Luffy shouts that if she gets too far away from him, then he cannot protect her, so Shirahoshi tells Luffy she will remain with him. Decken then attacks Shirahoshi with another axe with a rose painted on it. Luffy tries to help, but is blocked by locals who still think he is trying to harm the princess. Luffy apologizes, saying he has nothing against them, then knocks them out with a burst of Haoshoku Haki because they are in his way. He then kicks off from the ground, flying toward Decken who is still on the coral. He does a flip in the air and brings his legs down on the coral, sending it crashing to the ground and knocking Decken off. The locals are amazed at Luffy's abilities, even when he is tied up.\nDecken asks Luffy why he is interfering with his and Shirahoshi's love, and figures that Luffy was the one who brought Shirahoshi out of the palace. And Luffy realizes that Decken was the one who had been throwing things at Shirahoshi as he gets ready to do an attack. Decken tells him he will take both of their lives, saying they would not be a pair, as they would be cut into a set of four. Luffy then uses a new technique, Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer, plowing Vander Decken IX into the ground head first. The locals are shocked to see that Luffy beat Vander Decken.\nThey then realize that Decken was still moving, despite being planted head first into the ground, and decide to capture him. Luffy headbutts Megalo, telling him to wake up and asks Sanji if he is alright. Chopper tells Luffy that Sanji had turned to stone earlier, but now he seems happy, and most importantly, conscious. Luffy tells Shirahoshi they need to go. Shirahoshi asks Luffy not to yell at her, as all the excitement has gotten her quite worked up. Luffy tells her that for some reason the island hates them, and they need to get out of here.\nShirahoshi unties Luffy, making the locals wonder why she is helping him. She apologizes to them, and tells them she will be home in time for dinner, which confuses them. The Straw Hats get on Megalo's back, and Shirahoshi grabs on to his jaws (much to his discomfort), as they get away. Just as they get away, Vander Decken IX gets his head out of the ground and swats away the people trying to capture him. Yelling that they will not get away, he calls on Wadatsumi and tells him to pound them into the ground. Wadatsumi gets ready to punch them, but Luffy beats him to it, and hits him in the face with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol, breaking one of his teeth. Decken seems upset that they got away.\nThe scene changes to the Ryugu Palace, where someone informs Jones that Nami and Camie had escaped. Jones tells him to ignore it. Nami and Camie are then seen escaping, with the former holding onto the latter's back with an air bubble around her head. Camie asks if it was ok for them to leave the others behind but Nami tells her to relax, as nothing good could come by worrying. Camie tells her she knows that they are all strong, but that Hatchan told her that Jones's mind is more dangerous than his strength. Nami then asks her what kind of person Jinbe is. Camie replies that he is a pirate who is popular at the Ryugu Palace and can come and go as he pleases. Nami remembers that he was also in the same crew as Arlong, and that Jones is the successor to Arlong's will.\nShe then mentions one of Jinbe's messages to Luffy, \"Don't fight Hody\". Nami adds that she thinks she has figured out what the message means. Camie tells her she thought it only meant that Jones is dangerous. Nami adds that it is okay for Zoro and the others to get Jones angry. She then tells Camie she wants to meet Jinbe, and remembers he is waiting at the Sea Forest. Nami says that the situation seems to have a long and deep-rooted history, and has a feeling that Jinbe knows all about it. She then asks Camie to head to the sea forest.\nBack in the palace, Neptune is giving orders to his guards. The soldiers tell him they will take care of Jones and the pirates. Neptune tells them not to. He tells them that even though he did not get a chance to fight, they all ended up as victims. He orders them to surrender the castle for now, reunite with Fukaboshi, and get ready for the rematch.\nThe guards are shocked at the orders. Usopp and Brook are in the water. Usopp wonders what Zoro can do to fight a fish-man in the water as Brook tells Usopp he is not going to make it. The episode ends with Zoro seemingly defeating Jones with a single slash, and the New Fish-Man Pirates astounded at what happened to their captain, with Usopp looking on in shock.",

On the ship, Momonosuke talks about how he was traumatized by Doflamingo's cruelty and was afraid of what he might do to Kanjuro.\nMeanwhile on Dressrosa, Violet is seen heading towards the palace on her toy steed. Zoro and Kin'emon are with Bartolomeo who agrees to find Luffy for them only if Zoro gives him an autograph.\nAt the battle royale, Rebecca is knocking out fighters by tripping them out of the ring without injuring a single one until Rolling Logan confronts her.",
        "long_summary": "Doflamingo demands to know what Law plans to do with Giolla, since his Family will do anything to help their captain. Law simply switches her with a rock and allows her to flee, which she doesn't wait to do. Doflamingo states Law's grudge is just his pettiness of his past loss, but Law disagrees, claiming he plans to fulfill the dedication of a person he knew. Thus the two begin to clash on the bridge, with Law using his powers to create an explosion.\nOut at sea, Nami's group are trying to get back to Dressrosa while being on the lookout for Dolflamingo. Chopper is worried about Law while Sanji calls Usopp and finds out he's with Robin and Franky. Upon hanging up, he notices Momonosuke quite unnerved over something. Momonosuke tells him that he witnessed Doflamingo cruelly torture a subordinate for his failure in the arena when he had previously visited the island with his father and their friend, Kanjuro. After this, Kanjuro suggested they flee the island, but he was captured in the process, prompting Momonosuke to worry about his safety.\nSanji listens passively as he thinks about Violet. A flashback showing that while they were riding on a toy horse, Violet had told him she had someone in the Government waiting for her to take her off the island and thanks Sanji for his help. He tried to get her to kiss him on the cheek but she saw the school of Fighting Fish attacking the Sunny in her visions causing Sanji to take off to go help the others.\nBack in the present, Violet rides past a few people viewing the D-Block fight on a monitor. She shoots and destroys it with a pistol before asking the toy horse to take her back to the palace.\nAt the Colosseum, Bartolomeo has gotten the attention of Zoro and Kin'emon. He cries in joy, and is later told to inform Luffy that they are looking for him. He agrees, requesting Zoro's autograph as the reward from the request.\nIn the ring, Rebecca is managing to hold her own by staying near the edge of the arena and knocking off the opponents who try to attack her. The announcer reveals that she has managed to win all her battles this way without causing any harm to her opponents. However she is soon confronted by Rolling Logan, who sets his sights on her and threatens to break every bone in her body.",

Meanwhile, Hody has ordered all his men to move out of the Ryugu Palace to the Gyoncorde Plaza along with the residents of the Fish-Man District, allowing the captured Straw Hats to plot an escape plan.\nWhile recovering, Jinbe explains that if Luffy fights Hody now, the people of Fish-Man Island will see humans as a violent race, but Sanji says they have a reason to fight Hody to save their crew. However, Jinbe still will not allow Luffy to go, thus resuming their duel.",
        "long_summary": "Luffy and Jinbe start their duel to see who gets to fight Hody, and as Luffy tries to leave, Jinbe attacks him with his Fish-Man Karate, hurting Luffy. Nami wonders how it hurt him since he's a rubber man and Jinbe explains the mechanics behind Fish-Man Karate. As Luffy activates Gear Second and the two are about to clash, Robin interferes and as Sanji tries to save her, she disappears and Luffy, Jinbe, and Sanji all hit each other while the real Robin comes out of the forest revealing she's learned how to make clones of herself.\nAt the palace, Brook comes up with an idea to escape and shows off a new skill that involves him separating his soul from his body shocking Usopp and Zoro. He explains that he learned this trick from praying one day and has been using it's power to peek on girls while giving a perverted look, much to Usopp's jealousy. Zoro tells him to find Pappag and get him a sword and says he will cut the bars off of them. Brook eventually finds him, but Pappag is terrified and runs away screaming at Brook's ghoulish appearance thinking he's a ghost while Brook tries to tell him to give him a sword for Zoro. Meanwhile, Hody and his crew prepare to go to Gyonchorde Plaza to kill Neptune, however, the wound Zoro gave him is still hurting and takes more Energy Steroids to relieve him of the pain. As he's told of all the other Fish-Man moving into the homes on the island he says that's good and will make a new island of Fish-Man who hate humans. Fukaboshi and his brothers eventually defeat Dosun and his allies and head off to save their father.\nAt the Sea Forest, Luffy, Jinbe and Sanji pick themselves up from the attacks they received and Jinbe tells Luffy the reasons they cannot fight since it will just cause more hatred towards Fish-Man if humans get involved, especially the ones who stopped Arlong. Sanji states that since their crew is involved and the crisis that the island is in they just cannot leave the way things are now and have to help. He also notices how quite Hachi has been and recalls his statement about Hody showing no mercy towards Fish-Man who are friends towards humans and asks if Hody and the others hurt him cause of their friendship together. Camie also asks, but Hachi does not give a straight answer. Sanji says they have a reason to fight but then becomes all perverted saying it's to protect Shirahoshi and the mermaids he's met, much to Nami's annoyment. Luffy again tells Jinbe to move aside so he can beat Hody. However, Jinbe still will not allow him to go, stating that he himself must go and confront Hody, causing the two to duel again.",

        "long_summary": "As Luffy, Zoro and Viola advance through the castle, they notice that no guards are chasing them. At this moment, a face begins to form from the castle walls, getting bigger until it produces a full body. Viola curses as this stone monster is Pica of the Spade seat.\nAt the Royal Palace, Luffy's group stands before Pica, an executive officer. Viola reveals that he has eaten the Ishi Ishi no Mi which allows him to merge himself with any type of rock and he has currently merged himself with the palace which is made entirely of stone.This allows him to control the entire palace. He then attempts to crush Luffy and his group between the walls of the palace.\nMeanwhile, at the Underground Factory, Usopp notes that toys just keep coming out of the Factory proving that Sugar is in the Factory. He then asks the Dwarves what the tentacle-like things that are connected to the tower are. They explain to him that the one in the center is a lift that leads to the palace while the pipe-like things are tubes that reach the Scrap Heap. It takes people and broken toys from various places and drops them into the Scrap Heap which is below the Officer Tower.\nInside the Officer Tower, Cavendish is with Trebol and Sugar. Trebol tells him that he is in the Officer Tower which is a Factory-like room from toys are continuously spit out and that it is also known by another name. It is revealed that Trebol has eaten the Beta Beta no Mi. Trebol says that he will not listen to what a brat like him has to say. Cavendish orders Sugar to get the sticky substance by which he is bound off him, but she instead turns him into a toy and makes a contract with him without him even agreeing. The contract states that he will not harm humans and will bow to the orders of the Doflamingo Family. Almost immediately Cavendish loses his free will. Trebol states that now no one remembers who he is and now onwards he will, as a toy, have to work and die for Doflamingo. As a toy he is forced to work with the other toys to smuggle weapons. It is revealed that the other contestants who were taken to the infirmary were also made into toys and are being forced to smuggle weapons.\nUsopp, Robin, and their group of dwarves reach the room where Trebol and Sugar are located. The dwarves state that Sugar loves eating grapes. So their plan is to put a solid ball of the world's hottest spice, Tatabababasco, which they've made to look like a grape, into her basket of grapes. The seasoning is so spicy that when it was tested 50 times on the dwarves all of them fainted and 18 of them were on the verge of dying. Usopp tells Leo to go ahead and execute the plan and he will stay back and cover him although in his mind he intends to run away if the plan fails. Leo steps up to place the ball of Tatababasco into the basket as the other dwarves cheer him on. He says that when Sugar cries out, it will be the sign that all the toys will become human again and all their forgotten memories will return and the evil deeds of Doflamingo be brought to light and his true colors will be revealed to everyone! He shouts that he is going to save his friends and return the Kingdom back to King Riku.",

        "long_summary": "On a hill in Carta lies Kyros' house, where Kyros, the Straw Hats, Law, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bellamy rest and recover from their injuries. Kyros explains why he lives here and offers the group anything they may need, and Kin'emon asks why Bellamy is with them, to which Law replies that Luffy knows him so he brought him along. Kyros, Usopp, and Law fall asleep from exhaustion, and the door of the house begins opening. Zoro tenses up at the intrusion, but the person entering turns out to be Sabo, who throws Zoro a drink. Robin happily greets him as Zoro asks how she knows him to which she introduces Sabo as Luffy's brother which surprises Franky and Zoro. Sabo approaches Luffy, and Robin goes to wake him up, but Sabo states that she does not need to do that. Franky asks if he is leaving soon, which Sabo affirms, revealing that CP0 is heading for them. The Straw Hats prepare to leave soon as well, but wonder why Luffy never told them about having another brother. Sabo reveals that he was presumed deceased for a long time after getting into an accident.\nTwelve years ago, in Goa Kingdom, a ten-year-old Sabo asked about the country's plan to set fire to Gray Terminal. However, he was shocked to receive callous remarks about a plan that would kill many people. Sabo ran to warn Ace and Luffy, but he ended up beaten and lying in an alleyway. He was approached by Monkey D. Dragon, and told the mysterious man about his contempt for the town and his status. Feeling trapped, Sabo decided to set out to sea, but encountered a ship much larger than his small vessel. The large ship contained the World Noble Jalmack, who shot Sabo's ship with a bazooka due to it crossing his path. Sabo desperately tried putting out the flames, but the second shot completely destroyed his ship, sending his tattered hat flying into the water.\nBarely alive and with an injury around his left eye, Sabo sunk into the depths of the ocean, but was saved in the nick of time as Dragon grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the water. On a ship belonging to the Revolutionary Army, Emporio Ivankov and the revolutionaries grew anxious about when Dragon would return. Dragon then arrived with Sabo in his arms, and the ship's doctor was called. Sabo eventually woke up surrounded by revolutionaries. One of them asked if his name was Sabo due to it being written on his possessions, but Sabo had no memory of his name or anything at all. Another revolutionary decided that they should take him home and find his parents, but Sabo refused, having a bad feeling about his family despite not remembering them. Ivankov stated that they can't let him stay here, and Sabo replied that they could take him somewhere else. Dragon and Bartholomew Kuma then approached, and Ivankov asked Dragon what they should do.\nIn the present day, laborers work on rebuilding the palace as the Corrida Colosseum gladiators are taken to a room inside, with the worker promising them asylum from the Marines and a doctor. Boo wonders if there will be a banquet, but is told that it will be later. The gladiators prepare to go to sleep, especially Cavendish, but Bartolomeo knows what will happen if he goes to sleep. He tells people to bring him a chain, which he uses to wrap around Cavendish, telling the outraged gladiator that they will see a monster if they do not do this.\nAt Kyros' house, the Straw Hats ask Sabo if that was how he joined the Revolutionary Army, and Sabo replies that it was sort of like that. 12 years ago, Sabo trained on Baltigo with several children under Hack, but broke off from the exercise. Sabo told Hack that he was going to train himself before running off, and Hack told Ivankov that Sabo had a lot of fighting experience which his body still remembered. The days passed, with Sabo training and studying intensely. One day, Sabo fought Hack and succeeded in removing the fish-man's belt, causing his pants to fall down. He was then approached by Kuma, and was excited to fight him next, but was easily blown away. Meanwhile, Ace and Luffy sat on the coast Dawn Island, promising to get stronger and become pirates at age 17. Two years later, Sabo peeled potatoes with Koala, but was exasperated when they were given another box. He decided to break into the apples and eat them, but was reprimanded by Koala. Later, he fought Kuma once again, who sent him flying into a pile of boxes. However, Sabo discovered a pipe inside the wreckage, and he used it to vault off Kuma and attack Dragon. Dragon avoided Sabo's blow and knocked him out, but commended his fighting ability.\nSeven years later, Ace set out to sea to become a pirate, and the Revolutionary Army is engaged in battle with a military fortress. Hack and Koala sat helpless in the trenches, wondering what the people sneaking in first were doing. Right then, Sabo called them, briefly stating that he would figure something out before hanging up. Sabo then appeared right in front of the entrance and ran toward it despite enemy fire. He hardened his arm with Armament Haki and broke down the door, entering the fortress with ease. Sabo dispatched the enemy soldiers as the other revolutionaries freed the captured citizens and allies, and as he was surrounded, Sabo completely destroyed the fortress by using Ryusoken. At Baltigo, Sabo was commended for the victory, and a revolutionary talked about a rookie around Sabo's age who refused to join the Shichibukai. He began to say Ace's name, but Sabo completed it, stunning them. However, Sabo could not remember what he said. Three years later, Luffy headed out to sea and faced Lord of the Coast as a 20-year-old Sabo went to sea as well. In the present, the Straw Hats ask Sabo how he regained his memory, and Sabo grows tense as he reveals that Ace's death reawakened it.",
