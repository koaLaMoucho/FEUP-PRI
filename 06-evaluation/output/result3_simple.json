          "As Zou begins shaking due to the upcoming Eruption Rain, the Heart Pirates climb on trees while Luffy joins Wanda and Carrot atop Wany's back. At Kurau City, the concerned Straw Hats wonder why Zou is shaking. Wany starts to run as the elephant carrying Zou on its back, Zunesha, lifts up its trunk and spews out a large volume of water onto Zou. The Straw Hats run away, but realize that it is too late to avoid it. Meanwhile, Wany, Wanda, and Carrot are submerged in the raging flood, and eventually emerge from it; they then realize that Luffy has fallen off. They see Luffy flailing in the torrent, and Carrot leaps through tree branches to rescue him. Carrot barely misses Luffy's hand as he sinks underwater and is approached by a shark. Right as Luffy is by the shark's mouth, however, Carrot grabs him and brings him back onto Wany. Meanwhile, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete climb back up to Zou on a cat Kanjuro drew, which they call Nekozaemon. Suddenly, the water from the Eruption Rain comes flowing down, which Bariete explains the source of. Kanjuro reveals that the water will cause Nekozaemon to melt as they are hit by the cascade.\nMeanwhile, Wany swims through the flood, and Wanda explains to Luffy that Zunesha washed itself twice a day by spraying water on its back. The minks took advantage of this by building aqueduct systems to get drinking water, as well as catching fish to eat. Bepo then arrives by swinging through the trees, and tells Luffy to tell Law where he and the Heart Pirates are since he cannot leave the forest. Carrot tells Luffy that although Bepo is a native of this island, he is still a pirate, and so remains under the care of Master Nekomamushi. At Kurau City, the Straw Hats have escaped the flood on the rooftop of a building, although a frightened Usopp has climbed all the way up a tall tower. Usopp expresses his fright at the Eruption Rain (as the shark cruises by, causing him more panic), and as he looks out he spots Luffy riding with Wanda and Carrot. However, Carrot is biting Luffy, and Usopp thinks that they are eating him. Luffy tries to get Carrot off of him, and they pass by some crucifixes in Kurau City. Wanda and Carrot get emotional as they remember Jack torturing a dog mink in order to get information on someone's whereabouts, but the mink refused to tell him. Luffy asks about Jack again, and Wanda reveals that she read his obituary in the newspaper a few days ago. He had attacked four Marine ships transporting Donquixote Doflamingo, and managed to sink two of them, but was ultimately brought down. However, his death could not be confirmed, and Wanda thinks he is still alive, saying that she will never forgive him.\nAs the floodwaters finally drain away, Wanda decides to take a shortcut as Wany picks up its speed. As Luffy expresses excitement at exploring Zou, Law suddenly teleports himself and the Straw Hats right in front of Wany. Usopp attempts to use Zoro's power to threaten the minks into handing Luffy over, but a slightly annoyed Wanda states that they mean no harm and are already at their destination, the Right Belly Fortress. Wanda tells the two guards at the entrance that the Straw Hat Pirates have arrived, surprising them. Inside the Right Belly Fortress, Nami is sleeping on a large sheep mink named Yomo, and Chopper comes to her to reveal that their crewmates are here. Yomo accidentally causes Nami to fall off him as he gets up, but Nami is excited for a reunion. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Law enter the Right Belly Fortress, and receive an unexpectedly warm welcome from the minks. Zoro confides to Wanda that they had thought minks were hostile to outsiders, but Wanda replies that they considered humans to be hairless versions of themselves and did not judge by appearance, but by character. Nami and Chopper then appear, but are stopped by some affectionate minks. The Straw Hats have an emotional reunion as Chopper happily hugs Usopp, but when Luffy mentions Sanji in his greeting, Nami's expression changes as she embraces him. In tears, she begins to reveal something that happened to Sanji."

        "long_summary": [
          "After their brief initial run-in with the Flying Fish Riders, the Straw Hat Pirates begin to plan their rescue of Camie's fish-man friend. Luffy is excited over their flying fish. Usopp asks Franky to move the cannons up to the deck so they can shoot down the flying fish. Camie is worried about \"Hacchin\", but Pappag says she should worry about herself, since she's the one the Macro Pirates are after. Back at their compound, Duval tells the Riders that he aborted the attack because he wanted to kill the man that ruined his life himself. He thanks the Macro Pirates for their help; he had no idea that their alliance would hasten his finding the Straw Hats.\nOverhearing this freaks out the Macro Pirates' hostage: Hatchan, the octopus Fish-Man that, long before, was a member of the Arlong Pirates. He is distressed that the very pirates that defeated him before are coming to save him now. He knows Nami will be among them, and figures there's no way they'll save him once they find out who he is. As the Thousand Sunny arrives at Duval's compound, they put Hatchan in a cage, despite a last-ditch effort to bribe the Macro Pirates into freeing him with takoyaki. Nami continues to show concern as everyone refers to Camie's friend as \"Hacchin\". When Hatchan sees the ship, and recognizes the crew, he makes one last effort to break out of his cage, before spitting ink all over himself in a thin attempt at a disguise.\nNobody else is around \"Hacchin\"'s cage; the Straw Hats are certain he is being used as a trap of some sort. As they approach the inky creature, he begs Camie to turn around, that he'll get free himself and rejoin them somehow. The longer they persist, the more doubt grows among the Straw Hats who fought Arlong. Sanji calls out, asking how Arlong was doing. Hatchan responds that Arlong and the others were captured by the Marines, but he escaped to chase his dream as a takoyaki cook. Luffy recognizes him immediately; Hatchan curses himself for letting it slip.\nUsopp explains to the more recent crew members how Arlong ruled over Nami's home island, and Luffy defeated them. Zoro pointedly tells Camie that Hatchan is no friend of theirs. Luffy aborts the rescue, but before they move to leave, he asks how good his takoyaki is. Hatchan understands, figuring this is exactly what would happen, but Camie and Pappag refuse to believe they'd go back on their promise. They jump overboard to rescue him themselves...only to be caught within seconds by the Macro Pirates. Hatchan starts crying, and thrashes about in his cage, trying to get out to save Camie. Seeing his effort, Nami relents and tells the crew to go save Hatchan. She says they promised Camie, and Hatchan is probably harmless to them by now. Luffy agrees, but it's clear he still just wants takoyaki.\nDuval relaxes for a moment with his helmet off, and calls his associates on Den Den Mushi, asking if his men's \"preparations\" are complete. Luffy jumps off the ship, using Gomu Gomu no Pistol to grab Camie and Pappag, then uses Hatchan's cage as a stepping stone to get on Duval's compound. Macro is surprised that he's a Devil Fruit user. Luffy orders Zoro to cut Hatchan's cage open, but the octopus warns them that the Flying Fish Riders' trap has been sprung. Duval gives the order, and the Flying Fish Riders rise from the ocean, circling the compound and the Thousand Sunny. Luffy orders his crew to prepare for battle, assuring Camie that they are ready for anything."

Chopper and Usopp overhear the offer, but Nami and Zoro stop them from being conned after Zoro finds an associate painting them. Zoro notices a man asking if people in the town had seen Luffy, using his wanted poster. He is directed to Spice Bean where the owner knows many of the townspeople.\nThe present Straw Hats wonder why he is looking for Luffy. Zoro notices the tattoo on the man's back, and knows he is not a bounty hunter. He then sees Tashigi elsewhere in the town, dressing a shopkeeper down for overpricing swords, and hides. Smoker appears, carrying several captured small-time pirates. He is sure Luffy will show up in Arabasta, and has Tashigi take the defeated pirates to the Royal Army. Zoro wonders where Luffy ran off to. He is wandering across the desert, and starts running when he sees a town nearby, hunger driving him to find food.\nAt the Spice Bean restaurant, patrons are gathered around the young man seen earlier, who is face-first in a plate of food. They believe he has dropped dead mid-eating, and suspect he was bitten by a venomous insect. Suddenly, he wakes up, wipes his face off, and resumes eating. He tells everyone he just fell asleep. Shortly after, he falls asleep again. After waking up, the man asks Yoshimoto if he has seen Luffy.\nThey are interrupted by Smoker, who noticed the earlier commotion. He identifies the young man as the Second Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Portgas D. Ace, startling those present. When asked why he is here, Ace says he is looking for his brother. Luffy is running through Nanohana, tracing the scent of food. Smoker says he is not here for Ace, but will go ahead and try to capture him. Suddenly, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Rocket to launch himself towards Spice Bean. He rams Smoker and Ace through the restaurant's rear wall and the walls of several adjacent buildings, then demands the restaurant owner make him food.\nWhile Luffy is chowing down, Ace and Smoker are on their way back to the restaurant. Ace apologizes to a family for disturbing their meal. Smoker identifies Luffy, though it takes a second for Luffy to remember him from their encounter at Loguetown. He stacks all the remaining food in his mouth, and runs, with Smoker chasing him. The owner notes that neither Ace nor Luffy paid for their meals. Luffy knows he cannot beat Smoker, so he goes looking for his crew. Smoker sees Tashigi and orders her to look for the Straw Hats as he pursues Luffy. As she runs, knowing that Luffy is in town, she thinks it is likely for Zoro to be there as well.\nSmoker asks Luffy why he is in Arabasta, to which he responds he came to beat up Crocodile. Smoker asks him how they are connected but Luffy disappears. On the other side of town, Nami, Zoro, Chopper and Usopp catch back up with Sanji, Vivi and Karoo, and tell them the Marine is present. They hear a commotion, and Luffy soon runs to them, with Smoker on his trail. Smoker is intercepted by Ace, who uses Kagero to halt his attack, White Blow.\nLuffy recognizes Ace, and is surprised he is a Devil Fruit user now. Ace tells him he ate the Mera Mera no Mi. He then tells Luffy to run, and says he will hold Smoker off. Smoker asks why Ace is helping the Straw Hats and he says a big brother has to help his little brother. Luffy tells his crew that Ace is his brother, to their shock, as they make their getaway."

          "As Wanda, Carrot, and the Straw Hat Pirates go off to see Nekomamushi, Wanda remarks on the full moon in the sky, saying she is glad it is covered by clouds. Luffy then says that Sanji and Caesar Clown were still present on Zou in her story, asking her what happened to them later. Wanda hesitates, and Brook decides to explain it himself. He tells the Straw Hats that most of the minks were not told about this, and this may be hard for them to hear. He then reveals that Sanji is likely not coming back, which angers Luffy, who pointed to the note Sanji left, which states that he would be back. However, Nami and Brook reply that the situation is far more complicated than what the note suggests, and that it may have been better to tell the story before showing the note.\nBrook then tells the story, explaining how when they were being pursued by the Big Mom Pirates, the enemy pirates overheard Luffy's call to the Sunny crew revealing that their destination was Zou. Although Zou was a Phantom Island that could not be found with a Log Pose, one of their Big Mom Pirates was from the island, and so two days ago their ship docked at Zou. On the ship, Pekoms contacted Big Mom, telling her to leave the expedition to him as he was a native Zou. Later, Pekoms and Capone Bege made it onto Zou and into the Mokomo Dukedom, where they discovered the destroyed Kurau City. Pekoms flew into a rage upon seeing his hometown destroyed, and looked around for survivors but found none, causing him to scream in anguish.\nInside the Rightflank Fortress, Sanji prepared meals for the minks, who loved them, and afterwards he went out to interact with the female minks. As Chopper, Miyagi, and Tristan treated patients, Sanji nuzzled with female minks in their traditional greeting known as \"minkship\", but wanted nothing to do with male minks, leaving them disappointed. Meanwhile, Wanda outfitted Nami with a dress, revealing that exchanging clothes was a big part of mink culture and that the dress was a natural treasure, causing Nami to get excited at the prospect of selling it for big money. Sanji then saw Nami in the dress, causing him to race at her in excitement, but she punched him out of the fortress. Meanwhile, Chopper asked Brook where Momonosuke was, and Brook revealed that he was still in his room, though it was for the best that the minks not see him in his human form. Caesar Clown said that they should abandon him and leave the island as soon as possible, but Chopper got angry at the suggestion, telling him to continue working on treatments for the minks. A mink came to collect treatments from Caesar, but the scientist, mortified at his name being associated with humanitarian treatment, disguised himself. The mink told Brook that his fans were outside, which were dogs looking to chew on the skeleton, and Brook was not inclined to go out and meet them.\nAt the Fortress gate, the two guards braced themselves as two strangers came up to them, but realized that one of them was Pekoms. Pekoms bawled with happiness as he saw his fellow minks alive, and embraced the two guards. He asked if the Straw Hats had done the damage to the Mokomo Dukedom, but ultimately concluded that they did before the guards could correct him, causing him to go into a fit of rage. Pekoms then entered the Rightflank Fortress, where he reunited with his family and more of his kinfolk. The minks revealed to him that Jack and the Beasts Pirates had destroyed the country while the Straw Hats had saved them, causing Pekoms to curse Jack. The Straw Hats saw Pekoms and Bege from a balcony, and Caesar grew afraid and asked for the Straw Hats' continued protection, but Sanji replied that since Luffy defeated Doflamingo, Caesar was no longer of any worth to them as a trump card. Out of curiosity, Sanji asked why the Big Mom Pirates wanted Caesar, and the scientist replied that he had taken money to fund a commission Big Mom gave him, but he spent it on other things; Sanji replied that he deserved what was coming. Caesar offered to assist Sanji in eliminating the Big Mom Pirates, and the Curly Hats realized that they may be in trouble as well since Luffy had declared war with Big Mom on Fish-Man Island. However, Sanji refused Caesar's advances, and told Brook to come with him and the rest to stay as he made eye contact with Bege.\nBack in the present, the Straw Hats remark on two Four Emperors crews being on Zou in such a short timespan, and Luffy wonders if Sanji fought Pekoms, as he does not really care due to having declared war on Big Mom. Brook continues his story, revealing that Sanji and Brook went out with Pekoms and Bege. Sanji was willing to face the two pirates head-on, but stated that if a fight was in order they would have to do it outside of Zou. However, a tearful Pekoms embraced Sanji, shocking the Straw Hats and Bege. Pekoms thanked Sanji for saving his people, and revealed to him that in addition to capturing Caesar, their crew had another mission that would likely tear the Straw Hats apart. However, out of gratitude, he was willing to purposely fail that mission as long as they got Caesar. Bege reprimanded Pekoms, but the mink silenced the newer member of the crew, saying he would take any punishment Big Mom gave him. This caused Bege to grow angry and call Pekoms a coward as he raised his hand toward the kneeling mink's back. Suddenly, a rapid stream of bullets emerged from Bege's hand, striking Pekoms in the back."

          "With his Marines having located the Straw Hat Pirates, Vice Admiral Garp sets sail in his ship for Scrap Island. He and his crew are annoyed with the order from Fleet Admiral Sengoku to exterminate the Straw Hats there at Water 7, but saw little choice in the matter with Admiral Aokiji on-board his ship. With the Franky Family calling their farewells to Franky, the Straw Hats set sail on their new ship. But some of the crew are concerned, because one person is missing. Luffy knows.\nFlashback to a few days before at Galley-La Company's headquarters, where Sanji told Luffy about Usopp's plan to ask to rejoin the crew. At first Luffy is eager to take Usopp back, but Zoro speaks up with an objection. He says it is not right for Usopp to return without at least an apology after the way he quit originally, especially with the duel he fought with Luffy over the Going Merry. Zoro says it is not right for Usopp to be accepted back so easily after the duel, and they must respect its result. He insists that allowing Usopp back without such would be an insult to Luffy's authority as captain, and that he will quit if Luffy allows himself to be walked all over like that. He says it is time for them to stop treating being pirates as a game, and that Usopp needs to learn to a lesson on not quitting so easily. Luffy understands Zoro's point, and agrees.\nBack in the present, Luffy is convinced (at least outwardly) that Usopp is not returning, but is certain they will run into each other again in the future. Meanwhile, Usopp is running through Water 7, eager to return to the crew and certain they will welcome him back with open arms. On the ship, Nami asks Luffy to wait just a little while longer, but a cannonball splashing in the water signals their time is up. Vice Admiral Garp has caught up with them. Everybody, especially Luffy, is surprised that it is Garp attacking them. Garp uses a megaphone to hail his grandson. Garp apologizes for the change in situation, since he said previously he would let Luffy leave Water 7, but does say he will take care of the matter by himself.\nWith that, Garp uses his superhuman strength to hurl cannonballs at the ship far harder than a cannon would fire them, an attack he calls Genkotsu Meteor. He fires a warning shot that explodes on the shore by the ship, blowing it out into open water. He calls for more cannonballs so he can proceed with Genkotsu Ry\u016bseigun: he plans on rapid-firing cannonballs at Luffy's ship. Luffy's crew prepares to fend off the attack. Chopper sniffs the air, and senses that Usopp has arrived by the shore of Water 7.\nUsopp makes it to the shore above Scrap Island and runs through the gathered crowd to see what is going on. Zambai asks him what he is still doing here. He looks up, and sees the new ship as it sails away. Usopp panics, not knowing why they'd leave without him after his help at Enies Lobby. They could not possibly have forgotten that he is really Sogeking, could they? Seeing the attack begin, he jumps to Scrap Island and runs after the ship along the shore, trying to get their attention as they fend off Garp's constant rain of cannonballs. Chopper tries to tell them that Usopp has arrived, but they are too busy defending the ship.\nUsopp calls out to his shipmates, trying to get their attention. All the while, he is in denial that they could have taken his resignation from the crew seriously, and that is why they are leaving without him. He reaches the shore of Scrap Island, and calls for them to stop fooling around. Chopper tries one more time to get Luffy and Zoro to listen for Usopp, but they claim they cannot hear him. Usopp watches in growing despair as the ship sails further away under Garp's attack. Usopp thinks back to the circumstances of his departure and sinks to his knees, realizing finally what his hasty resignation is about to cost him.\nWith tears streaming, Usopp screams to the ship that he is sorry. Luffy finally stops, hearing his mea culpa. Usopp apologizes for being so selfish and stubborn, and that he wishes he could take back what he had said when he left. He begs to be allowed back in the crew. With that, Luffy stretches his arm out to the shore, and screams for Usopp to grab on. He pulls Usopp back onto the boat, tears streaming, as the rest of the crew splits time between rejoicing at the heartfelt reunion and continuing the defense of their ship. With their crew finally complete, Luffy orders his men to fight off the bombardment so they can continue their journey."

          "As Panz Fry is being taken into custody by the Marines, Vice Admiral Momonga questions him for his actions in taking the pirates' food from before, Panz Fry states it was because there are other starving people that need it more and that all of the food that Marines take is used for the World Nobles and states they do not need all of the food and question how could the Marines let others starve for the sake of the cruel World Nobles. Momonga states regardless he is still going to Impel Down for being a pirate.\nMeanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates have Nami create a plan for the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates to rescue Lily's father. Chopper, Robin, Brook, and Luffy are the diversion group while Usopp, Sanji, Zoro, and Lily are in the submarine. Luffy goes on the submarine because he finds the diversion group boring. As they go to rescue him, Usopp mentions to Lily that they have met giants before such as Dorry and Brogy, surprising Lily that they met them and states that her father have been friends with the two since they were kids. They execute the plan as Robin uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to take out the Marines around the ships while Brook uses his Yomi Yomi no Mi abilities to scare them away. Sanji uses Sky Walk to fight the Marines from another ship while Zoro cuts the chains around Panz Fry. They rescue Panz Fry, but Momonga attacks Luffy, forcing Zoro to intercept him on the spot.\nAs Lily is reunited with her father, the reunion is ruined as a person named Shuzo intercepts them and attacks Panz Fry. Momonga is shocked to see him, as the two reveal a history together. Shuzo states that the Marines sending a pirate to Impel Down is pathetic and that all pirates from the New World need to be killed and he, along with the Neo Marines and their leader, Z will execute all pirates in the world. Momonga is shocked by the name, having known Z for a while, as the latter is a former Marine Admiral.\nShuzo now decides to kill Panz Fry himself and goes to attack him, but Sanji intercepts and Shuzo is tackled to the ground by the pirate. Luffy attempts to attack and is thrown into the water prompting Zoro to abandon his fight with Momonga and save Luffy. Luffy eventually is saved and prepares to fight Shuzo himself while Zoro will fight Momonga."

          "Garp reveals that he won't capture his own grandson. He more or less came to make sure he was okay and to let Koby and Helmeppo see him. While the Marines repair the damage to Iceburg's building, he lets the three take some time to catch up and chat, though he does slug Luffy once more when Luffy doesn't show some reluctance. Nami, Chopper, and Sanji come to realize just where Luffy gets his stubborn and stupid streaks.\nAfter Garp leaves, the rest of the Straw Hats discuss Garp's revelations. Robin in particular is amazed at the connection to Dragon, not realizing Luffy would be connected to something even more dangerous than the scholars of her home island, Ohara. Zoro isn't with Luffy because his association with Koby was tenuous; his history is more with Luffy than with anyone else. Nami is notably absent; Chopper notes she'd wanted to seek out some Marine intel while they were here but instead went to the pool with Kokoro and Chimney. Hearing that, Sanji rushes off to the pool.\nOutside, Luffy learns to his surprise that the Marines have found a way to safely cross the Calm Belt, meaning they don't have to go through Reverse Mountain to reach the Grand Line. Thanks to the work of a scientist named Dr. Vegapunk, Marines have covered the bottoms of their ships with seastone. Because of Kairoseki's natural sea energy emissions, this hides their presence from the Sea Kings meaning as long as they can address the issue of power, they can come and go more or less freely, giving them a huge maneuverability advantage.\nUnknown to them, a Baby Den Den Mushi is hidden near their location. Nami was actually at the pool and listening in on Koby through a Black Den Den Mushi. She files the knowledge of the Kairoseki trick away for future reference. She also learns that it was Vegapunk who found the way to infuse Devil Fruits into inanimate objects\u2014resulting in things like Spandam's Elephant Sword Funkfreed\u2014as well as more insight as to how Devil Fruits actually work. The conversation then turns to Garp, revealing that all three admit he's an advocate of \"tough love\": he may test you to the verge of death, but in the end you become stronger for it. Plus Koby and Helmeppo are grateful for him taking them in after the incident of Axe-Hand Morgan's escape. Nami finally decides she'll learn no more secrets and finally goes for a swim, but she almost inhales water when she passes under Kokoro in mermaid form: some things will just never cease to shock.\nRegretfully, Luffy, Koby, and Helmeppo's reunion is brief, as they have to go back to Headquarters and resume training. But before going, Koby leaves a tantalizing fact: the back half of the Grand Line is known as \"The New World\". It's becoming a focal point for both pirates and Marines, and the next Pirate King will likely be crowned there. Luffy realizes he needs to be part of this action. Koby's hope is that one day, even as opponents, they can meet there and vie to see who's dream is realized first: Luffy being the next Pirate King or he becoming the next Admiral. Luffy acknowledges this and without a hint of ridicule challenges him to realize that dream and meet him in The New World as a worthy rival. Encouraged, Koby rushes off with a confused Helmeppo following.\nBack on Garp's ship, Koby wonders if the Straw Hats are fully aware of just how the World Government is depicting the Enies Lobby incident. Helmeppo points out that Koby's seeing the darker side of the World Government: one determined to maintain its stranglehold on power by hook or crook. Cover-ups like this are to be expected. Just then Garp stops their reminiscing and gets them back to training.\nBack at the pool, Sanji is cooking up a barbecue. Everyone agrees it's delicious, and the taste is enough to even overlook Kokoro in mermaid form for the time being. Just then, Zambai and the Franky Family join them, encouraged by the news that Luffy was awake. Luffy invites them to the meal, starting off a comical cavalcade of other new arrivals: Oimo and Kashii, Sodom and Gomorrah, Iceburg and the Galley-La Company shipwrights, Franky, Mozu, and Kiwi. Even Usopp manages to join in his Sogeking disguise. What had started as a friendly little barbecue among the crew soon turns into a gigantic celebration.\nAs the sun begins to set, Robin finds a little peace and quiet against a wall. Just then, a familiar voice addresses her from the other side of the wall. It's Aokiji. He starts by asking why Robin didn't run away like she had for 20 years. Robin replies that she can't run away anymore: not when she now has finally found her friends. Then Aokiji drops a bombshell: Jaguar D. Saul, whom he'd been forced to kill 20 years ago, was a close friend of his. But while he'd been compelled by duty that day, he also allowed him one boon: that being to make sure Robin was safe. So for 20 years he'd kept tabs on the homeless, friendless Robin. By the time of their encounter prior to Water 7, Aokiji was prepared to believe Robin was becoming too dangerous. Then Enies Lobby happened and complicated the matter. No one had really thought the Straw Hats would go through CP9 and a Buster Call to rescue her. So he asks one more time, \"Have you finally found a tree to call home?\" Robin finally answers, \"Yes.\" And Aokiji is finally relieved. With true friends, Robin can stop running away from her past and stand tall as the last survivor of Ohara. He tells Robin to live her life with resolve and then leaves. By the time Robin reaches the spot where Aokiji had been, all that's there is an icy \"X\". She's finally drawn back to the party by Luffy. As Aokiji calmly bikes away, Robin realizes that Saul's greatest wish has indeed been granted; she is homeless and friendless no more."

          "Shanks stands firm before Akainu while Garp recognizes the former for corrupting his grandson into being a pirate. Almost all the pirates and Marines are surprised, while an amused Teach catches notice. The Red-Haired Pirates had arrived. While Law's submarine sails away, his crew members race to save Luffy and Jinbe who are rapidly losing blood. As they prepare for transfusion, Bepo reminds his captain they need to go underwater soon. The Marines learn that Shanks' crew had a run-in with one of the other Four Emperors, Kaido, yesterday. Buggy freaks out at seeing Shanks, as the latter is surprised to see him but the clown pirate doesn't want to be in Shanks' presence. Shanks throws his straw hat to Buggy for the clown to loan to Luffy. The clown pirate yells that he doesn't want anymore favors from the red-haired pirate. Shanks also says he has got a treasure map that could suit Buggy fancy. When Shanks moves to give the map to another, Buggy quickly decides to comply to his former crewmate's request and get the Straw Hat to Luffy. Lucky Roux wonders if Shanks is going to let Luffy leave without a chance to greet him.\nWith their times flying by, Shanks thinks back to his first meeting with Luffy, and how he sacrificed his arm to save him from the Sea King. He begins to wonder what Luffy would say at their moment. Bepo calls to Law for attention as they don't want the Marines to hit their submarine hard, or for the captain to drown. Buggy then races with the Straw Hat and slings it into Law's hand. The pirate surgeon and Bepo head inside the submarine and it begins to submerge. With the two racing to Luffy's side, Shanks knows that his reunion with Luffy will have to wait. He also thinks back to when he gave his Straw Hat to Luffy and expects it returned in good condition and will meet whence Luffy becomes a great pirate. Once the submarine submerges, Shanks says he can't see Luffy again just yet. Law begins his operation as Akainu ran both Jinbe and Luffy through, but is more worried about the emotional scars that Luffy has suffered.\nMeanwhile, Akainu curses Shanks for allowing Luffy's escape while his comrades are determined to finish Luffy with Aokiji firing an Ice Age, threatening to freeze the water. With Luffy's pulse steadying, the submarine is struck, but Jean Bart makes the submarine go full speed for a dive. Just as the ice is inches from giving the submarine a fatal blow, it evades. Bepo breathes a sigh of relief. However, Kizaru fires a Yasakani Sacred Jewel shower, rocking the submarine heavily. Hancock tries to protest. When he stops, the light admiral says that if Law's group survived, luck may not be on the side of the Marines. Hancock hijacks a Marine ship and tells the crew she will capture Luffy on her authority as a Warlord. Shanks stares at the horizon as Luffy leaves the area.\nBuggy lashes out at Shanks as the treasure map was all a trick. The Red Haired Pirate Captain says he was just having fun with his old friend and is happy to see him again. The Clown pirate reacts angrily to this and reminds Shanks that if he hadn't spotted him with the Bara Bara no Mi or the map, he would not lose it. Buggy yells that Shanks is a prodigy when it comes to making him angry. He also declares war on Shanks, as his impressed followers internally promise to serve him forever. Shanks leaves Buggy to handle his business with the war, as Buggy protests this but soon realizes he could hitch a ride with Shanks' crew to safely leave Marineford.\nShanks walks past Marco, informing him that there is no further need for combat and he must resign. Mihawk walks past the Marines as they protest, he firmly tells them while he agreed to fight Whitebeard's crew, Shanks was another matter telling the Marines to quit and he leaves the area. Shanks warns to everyone present on Marineford that their fighting is becoming pointless. Every blow one party lands, it goes back to their own as well. He draws his sword as he tells them that if anyone wants another fight, the red-haired pirate dares the pirates and marines to fight him. The Marines are in shock, while Teach's crew stands in idle. Shanks confronts Teach and asks if he wants to escalate things. An amused Teach compliments Shanks for the scars that he left on Shanks' eye. Just as both crews prepare to duel, Teach laughs as he announces to his crew to resign. He declares he already had what he wanted and doesn't wish for another fight with Shanks, at least not yet. The Blackbeard pirates pull out and leave the area.\nSengoku shifts back to his human form and Shanks sheathes his sword. With Ace and Whitebeard dead, Shanks tells everyone to accept the losses, honor the fallen and leave with their dignity intact. Whitebeard's crew mourn the loss of their captain and the Marines tend to their fallen. At Sabaody, Reuder remarks that the war seems to be ending.\nShanks requests that Ace and Whitebeard be given a proper burial and doesn't want their corpses paraded through like trophies. With the Marines ultimately victorious, they want to string their dead enemies up as proof of their triumph. However, Sengoku consents and allows Shanks to give Ace and Whitebeard the proper burial, something that the pirate thanks. Sengoku then orders the injured to be tended to and announces the war is finally over. As the wounded are gathered, Garp orders the soldiers not to lose anymore good men while he sheds tears at his loss.\nShanks then looks upon the bodies of Ace and Whitebeard as he sadly looks on."
