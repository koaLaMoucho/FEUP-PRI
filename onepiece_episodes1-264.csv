Once the cruise ship's sails have been destroyed, the Alvida Pirates board the ship to plunder its goods, and Alvida also forces one of her chore boys, Koby, to board the ship.

He explains his desires to escape the Alvida Pirates some day and join the Marines.
Alvida is informed of Luffy's presence, and, out of suspicion that he could be a bounty hunter, confronts him and Koby in the pantry. This triggers a battle on the ship, but Luffy defeats the pirates. Although Alvida is armed with a large spiked club, her attacks are rendered ineffective, as Luffy ate a Devil Fruit, granting him a superhuman ability that gives his body rubber-like properties. Using a Gomu Gomu no Pistol attack, Luffy defeats Alvida, sending her flying off the ship and into the sea.
Having concluded the battle, Luffy boards a dinghy with Koby to continue his travels, catching a glimpse of the female burglar who was also departing the ship on her own dinghy.

However, he accidentally hypnotizes himself, causing him to fall asleep as well.
Usopp and Luffy sit on a cliff, where they discuss Usopp's father, Yasopp. However, they find Klahadore, who is privately meeting with the hypnotist, Jango, at the base of the cliff. To their horror, they find that Klahadore was really Captain Kuro of the Black Cat Pirates.

As the only entrance to the village is a single sloped path at the island's south end, they stand guard at the pathway to prevent the Black Cat Pirates from entering.

As a last-ditch effort to penetrate the crew's defenses, Jango summons the Nyaban Brothers, Sham and Buchi, who had been watching over the ship. Although the Nyaban Brothers initially appear weak and cowardly, they use this as an act to catch Zoro off guard. Sham takes two of Zoro's katanas, leaving him to defend himself with a single sword.

Miss Kaya's Life and Death Confrontation,16-Feb-00,"Captain Kuro himself arrives at the scene, and with Zoro too injured to fight, Luffy being incapacitated, and the other two, Nami and Usopp, being too weak to handle him, things seem hopeless. However, Kaya herself appears to bargain with Kuro.","This episode starts with a recap of the previous episode and opens with Kuro arriving at the north slope, very angry that his plan did not go as planned. Jango and the rest of the Black Cat Pirates are terrified by him, including Sham and Buchi. He can’t believe that his former crew was held back by a bunch of children. He asks Jango for an explanation. Jango reminds Kuro who said letting Usopp go would not cause any problems. Kuro said that he knew that Usopp would try in vain to stop the Black Cat Pirates from invading Syrup Village since no one would believe him, but the one thing he didn’t count on was the weakness of his crew.
This remark made Sham and Buchi very mad. They remembered Kuro as a strong killer and said they were sinking ships and vanquishing pirate crews while Kuro lived the good life. They accused him of becoming weak. They go straight to him, hoping to kill him. Jango tries to warn them, but it was no use. Before they could deal him a blow, he suddenly disappeared. And reappeared moments later behind them with his Cat Claws gloves on his hands. It surprised even Zoro. They tried to attack him again, but he disappeared one more time. Jango recognized this move as the Nukiashi technique, Kuro’s trademark attack. He reappeared behind Sham and Buchi again, with his claw-like knives pointing at them. Even Nami is impressed by this, as the Nyaban Brothers nearly defeated Zoro. This silent technique is so powerful, not even a group of 50 assassins could stop Kuro. Jango knew he hasn’t lost that attack by the way he always lifted his glasses to avoid being cut by his Cat Claws gloves.
Nami managed to get up despite her wound. Kuro gave his crew 5 minutes to kill Zoro. Otherwise, he will kill them all. Sham and Buchi go straight to Zoro to kill him. Jango encourages them to stop him. Nami kicks the two swords straight to Zoro. The swordsman managed to get them. Although a little upset that Nami kicks his swords without any respect, Zoro thanks her for giving him back his swords and he defeats the Nyaban Brothers by using the Tora Gari technique. Kuro is still counting the minutes. Usopp and the Black Cat Pirates are surprised by the swordsman’s attack. Even Jango is shocked by it.
Zoro said to Kuro that the former captain will be defeated in less than 5 minutes. Kuro is a little impressed. Buchi is still conscious and begs Jango to hypnotize him so he will become strong enough to defeat Zoro. Jango managed to do so and Zoro decided to deal with Buchi before he can fight Kuro. After being hypnotized, Buchi becomes stronger and more savage than before. His muscles even increased in size. That surprised Zoro, but he managed to regain his calm and decided to fight him no matter what happens. Meanwhile, Nami goes to wake up Luffy who is sleeping beneath the figurehead of the Bezan Black. She managed to wake him up by pressing her foot into his head. Luffy woke up just in time to stop Jango’s pendulum from killing Nami with his bare teeth while arguing with Nami for the way she wakes people up. Nami learned that Jango’s pendulum is also used as a weapon. Luffy broke the pendulum with his bare teeth, although it hurts him a little bit.
The Black Cat Pirates begin to think it will be impossible to defeat Luffy and Zoro since they appeared to be very strong. After waking up Luffy, Nami passes out for a bit. The pirates run from Luffy, scared for their life. While Buchi fights Zoro, Jango will deal with Luffy. Kuro said that time is up and he will kill everyone on the north slope. He is also surprised that Luffy survived the fall from the cliff since he thought that fall would have killed him.
Before Kuro could kill anyone, Kaya arrives and begs him to stop. Usopp managed to save her before Kuro slashes her. She said to Usopp that she could not bare to see him get hurt protecting her. She then talks to Kuro and said he can take her fortune and leave the village alone. Kuro said to Kaya he wants more than her fortune. He wants peace. He said, despite her plea, the Black Cat Pirates will still attack Syrup Village and kill her. She then pulled a gun from her coat and pointed it at Kuro. She threatens to kill him if Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates don’t leave the island this instant. Kuro managed to lower her guard down by talking about the last 3 years they spent together. He also said that spending 3 years with her was an insult to his pride as a pirate. He takes the gun from her and throws it to the ground.
Usopp takes the gun and tries to shoot Kuro down, but Kuro used his Nuki Ashi to reappear behind the liar with his Cat Claws gloves on. He tried to kill him to make him pay for punching him, but his attempts were stopped by Luffy who gave him a Gomu Gomu no Pistol, sending him to the ground. Luffy swears Kuro will have a bad day since he hates being punched.","Sham, Roronoa Zoro, Buchi, Jango, Nami, Kuro, Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp, Kaya",

After Zoro emerges victorious, he leaves to aid Kaya, while Kuro explains his background as a pirate captain and his intentions to quit piracy.","As the Usopp Pirates come to his aid and beat Kuro as he is down, but Kuro gets up and beats Usopp to the ground. Now knowing his opponent possessed a Devil Fruit ability, he decides to personally focus on Luffy, ordering Jango to pursue and kill Kaya. Although now incapacitated and no longer able to fight, Usopp orders the children to protect Kaya as she evades Jango's pursuit. Although Zoro attempts to aid Luffy, he is stopped by a strengthened Buchi. Although Buchi greatly disrupts the battlefield with his powerful attacks, Zoro uses his three swords to cut him down.
Kuro mocks Usopp for his weakness and determination to become a brave warrior, and his crew joins in the mockery. However, Luffy attacks the crew members with a boulder. With Luffy's permission, Zoro leaves the battlefield to help protect Kaya from Jango.
Luffy continues his battle against Kuro, but Kuro evades each of Luffy's attacks using his Nukiashi technique. Although his crew members cheer on him as their captain, Kuro denounces the title, explaining his intentions to no longer be a pirate captain.
When he was at sea, Kuro grew tired of being a fugitive under constant Marine pursuit, so he decided to carry out a plan. When his ship was attacked by a Marine ship, Kuro entered the ship and slaughtered every Marine onboard, save for a single soldier. Jango hypnotized the soldier and one of Kuro's own men who resembled him. Under hypnosis, the crewman believed himself to be Kuro, and the soldier turned him into the Marines. Believing him to be Kuro himself, the Marines arrested and executed him. Kuro was now free to live a more peaceful life, now only needing money inherited from Kaya.
Back to the present day, Kuro resumes his battle with Luffy. Using the boulder from before, Luffy manages to break off all the blades on Kuro's right glove. Luffy declares that as Kuro desired to retire from piracy, his ambition was greater.","Kuro, Jango, Roronoa Zoro, Buchi, Sham, Nami, Monkey D.

After Jango threatens to kill the children, Kaya agrees to sign the will as planned, and in exchange the children would be spared. However, before Jango is able to kill Kaya, Zoro and Usopp finally locate her and arrive to her aid.
At the northern coast, Kuro reveals his intentions to slaughter his entire crew to prevent any of them from exposing him in the future. His standard Nukiashi techniques fail against Luffy's attacks, so he uses his Shakushi technique, an indiscriminate attack in which he slashes all objects and people in sight at such a great speed he is completely invisible to his opponents. Although Luffy was his only opponent, the attack harms his own crew members, leaving them gravely injured.

Simultaneously, Zoro and Usopp arrive to protect Kaya from Jango. Zoro cuts down a tree branch, clearing the way for Usopp's Hissatsu: Kayaku Boshi, a fired pellet that explodes in Jango's face, defeating him. As he did not want to be known as the village hero, Usopp asks the children not to disclose his deeds to the townspeople.
After meeting with the crew to thank them for their help, Usopp meets with the children. Explaining his desires to leave the village to become a real pirate, Usopp disbands the crew, telling each child to pursue their individual ambitions.
To thank them for their heroic deeds, Kaya gifts the crew with the Going Merry, a full-sized caravel designed by Merry. Gratefully accepting the ship, the crew prepare to depart, also deciding to take Usopp along as a new permanent member of the crew.
Kaya meets with Merry at the coast, where Merry explains Usopp's past. In his childhood Usopp's father, Yasopp, set sail with Shanks to become a pirate, leaving behind his son and wife. Usopp's mother passed away from illness soon after Yasopp's departure. Now lonely, Usopp became the town liar, hoping that his lies would come true and his father would someday return.

Gaimon explains his past.

Gaimon finally found treasure atop a mountain, but fell off the mountain and into an empty treasure chest, where he became stuck. He also found out that his crew had already set sail, leaving him behind.
The crew decide to search for the treasure themselves. However, after Luffy climbs the mountain, he realizes that all five treasure chests at the top of the mountain were empty.

He confronted Zeff, who held a comparatively larger share, and cut open his bag. He finds, to his horror, that Zeff's ""share"" was treasure, and he had given Sanji all of the food. Sanji then discovers that he had also severed his right leg to save his life. Zeff explains his reasoning, stating that he also shared Sanji's dream of locating the All Blue, so he sacrificed his leg so Sanji could pursue the dream.

Cabaji slams a set of stocks down on Luffy, trapping him. Buggy declares his intention to publicly execute Luffy right there on the same platform where Gold Roger died.
Elsewhere, Nami notices bizarre weather patterns; a storm is forming unexpectedly. She tells Sanji and Usopp that they have to hurry back to the Going Merry. Zoro arrives and asks if they've seen Luffy, and has a premonition that something's about to happen. At another part of town, a Marine reports to Smoker and Tashigi that Luffy, Buggy and Alvida are all gathered in the town square. He orders one unit to sea to intercept any escape, and another to surround the square covertly for an ambush. When the other Straw Hats hear what Buggy has planned for Luffy, Zoro and Sanji run off to rescue him, leaving Nami and Usopp to take their supplies to the ship. When he surveys the scene at the square, Smoker thinks how pathetic Luffy looks. He decides to wait with his men and allow Buggy to take care of Luffy before swooping in. Luffy freaks out when he realizes he's about to die.
Nami tells Usopp this storm is going to be big. If the Marines stop Luffy and Buggy during the storm, they may not be able to escape. Marines are already preparing to raid the harbor of any pirate ships. But the Going Merry is more in imminent danger from Mohji and Richie, who guess which ship is Luffy's based on the jolly roger with the straw hat on it, intent on burning it to ensure Luffy can't escape if he manages to evade execution. Back at the square, Luffy drones for mercy as if bored. Given a chance for ""last words"" by Buggy, he declares that he will be the Pirate King. Those forced to stay and watch stand in shock. This buys time for Zoro and Sanji to arrive. As they fight through Buggy's and Alvida's men, however, Buggy swings the sword. Tashigi is shocked to find that Zoro is in league with a pirate. Sanji is too far away to kick the platform down. Smoker prepares to give the order to attack when Luffy's head falls. As the sword comes down, Luffy calls out to his crew.
Smoker notes that Luffy has a huge grin on his face. But right before Buggy's sword touches Luffy's neck, a bolt of lightning strikes him and the execution platform. The platform catches fire and collapses, and Luffy's hat flutters down to the ground as rain begins to fall. There to pick it up...is Luffy, standing unharmed by Buggy, who has been electrocuted. He laughs at his luck. Sanji asks Zoro if he believes in God now.
As the shocked crowd just stares at him, Smoker gives the word to attack, and Luffy, Zoro and Sanji make a run for it. As they are pursued by Marines, Smoker thinks about Luffy smiling. He thinks Luffy couldnt've known Zoro and Sanji would save him. He immediately thought of Roger. Luffy acted exactly the same way Roger did at his execution. Unit 1 was grounded because the rain ruined their gunpowder, and the new wind with the present storm would be a tail wind for a ship going to the Grand Line. Smoker decides to take Luffy on personally.
But elsewhere on the island, a man in a green hood with a large facial tattoo walks through the streets, saying the ""storm of fate"" has arrived.","Smoker, Tashigi, Monkey D.

The Puzzling Girl, Apis",17-Jan-01,"On a stormy night, a girl named Apis escapes from the Marines and arrives at Straw Hat Pirates' ship, but the girl upon learning that they are pirates, begins to hide some of the reasons why she is wanted by the Marines. As the Straw Hats escape from the Marines, they get caught in the Calm Belt.","A little girl on one of the Marines ships break free from her room after incapacitating one of her Marine guards. As the Marines begin to search the ship, the little girl makes it onto the deck and after climbing up the mast, accidentally opens up the ship's sail, causing it to tilt sideways. She then jumps on to a life boat to escape.
Back onboard the Going Merry, Luffy asks Nami if they reached the Grand Line yet when she tells him its only been two days. Usopp then spots a flock of birds off their starboard side and Luffy stretches his hand out to grab what he thinks will be a fish. The crew are all surprised when he pulls in a girl instead and accidentally knocks Zoro off the edge of the boat. The girl is unconscious but wakes up when she smells Sanji's cooking. After learning that she is on a pirate ship, she freaks out and refuses to eat any food given to her.
Later that night as her stomach growls, it drives her to sneak into the kitchen and later witnessing Luffy getting caught in a giant mousetrap set by Sanji to prevent people from stealing from the kitchen. As the rest of the crew is woken up, the girl steals some of Luffy's food and Nami reassures her that they are not evil. The next morning after Luffy raises the anchor, the girl proceeds to make breakfast for everyone but accidentally uses the wrong spice so everything comes out too spicy. The girl introduces herself as Apis and that her home is on Warship Island. Upon questioning why she was being held by the Marines, she refuses to answer and Sanji supports her, telling everyone that it's her business.
Aboard the Marine ship, the Marines spot the Straw Hats' ship and upon realizing that the missing girl is probably aboard it, they get ready to attack. Usopp tells the others about the approaching Marine fleet as they open attack on the Going Merry. The Straw Hats' ship manages to escape on a gust of wind heading south as the Marines begin to follow. The Marines then stop when they learn that the Straw Hats' ship is heading into the Calm Belt. As the Straw Hats celebrate their victory, Nami asks Zoro what is wrong when he asks her why it seems like they are not moving. Nami then screams, exclaiming that they have entered the Calm Belt.","Apis, Nelson Royale, Eric, Monkey D. Luffy, Nami, Sanji, Usopp, Roronoa Zoro",
Episode 55,The Holy Beast! Apis' Secret and the Legendary Island,24-Jan-01,"The Calm Belt is revealed to have no winds or currents as well as being the home of many giant Sea Kings. Apis forms a plan with Luffy's help and escapes the Sea Kings by riding with one's sneeze. Later, the crew reaches Warship Island, where they listen to the soporific story of the island's creation. After following Apis into a cave where a dragon is hidden, Luffy and Nami find the reason why Apis is being chased.","Having entered the Calm Belt, the Going Merry ends up on top of a Sea King's head and is surrounded by other Sea Kings, Zoro suggests that nobody should move or make a sound and hope that the beasts ignore them so they can paddle back. Usopp, in fear, shouts at the suggestion, which a Sea King hears causing it to attack the ship.
Apis falls off the ship but is rescued by Luffy before she is swallowed. She notices that Luffy's arm stretched when he rescued her. While being pulled up to the ship, she sees the Sea King's nose and asks Luffy to swing her back downwards. As she is going down, Apis grabs hold of the Sea King's nostril hair and pulls it out. Luffy finally pulls her back to the ship and Apis is caught by Zoro. The other Straw Hats realize that she pulled out the nostril hair and are panicking because the Sea King is about to sneeze, causing the ship to fall off its head. The force of the sneeze launches the ship across the Calm Belt past the Sea Kings and back to where they started outside the Calm Belt.
The crew continue to sail on towards Warship Island. They spot what seems like a huge ship through a thick fog and are awed at its gigantic size. Apis tells them that it is not a ship but is in fact Warship Island and that it is named so because it resembles a warship.
As they are approaching the island's port, the residents see their ship and panic seeing their pirate flag. Fearful of a pirate invasion, some of the residents meet them at the shore with weapons. Apis goes down from the ship and greets them. The residents are surprised that Apis is with pirates and ask her why she brought them to the island.
The rest of the crew disembark the ship. Apis tells the residents to relax because they are not bad pirates but are nice and helpful. The residents, still skeptical about the crew, continue to question Apis about how she ended up with them since the last time they saw her, she was taken by the marines. She explains how she escaped, got stranded in the ocean and was rescued by the Straw Hats. The residents continue to ask Apis why she was taken in the first place and that it is not safe for her to stay on the island since the marines are still lurking around. An old man calls to Apis and tells her to come to his house. Nami asks who the man is, while Apis runs towards him and tells her that it is her grandfather, Bokuden. Her grandfather thanks the crew for saving his granddaughter and, in honor of Apis' safe return, invites them to a celebration, to which they accept.
Meanwhile, marines continue to patrol around the island and spot the Going Merry, the Straw Hats and Apis. This is reported to Nelson Royale, who was under the impression that the girl was lost at sea. He verifies this with Eric, who confirms that she indeed got lost at sea. Nelson Royale tells him he is wrong and relays the report to Eric that Apis is back on Warship Island and commands him to capture her again.
Back on the island, Bokuden is preparing pork buns for the celebration but says that they will not be ready for at least 4 to 5 hours. While waiting, Nami asks Bokuden why the marines are after Apis. Bokuden directs the question back to Apis to which she answers that she does not know. Nami comments that Apis mentioned earlier that she knew why they are after her but just refused to tell them. Apis brushes this off and tells them that she lied. Bokuden then says that he really does not know any reason why the marines would be after Apis and there is nothing significant about the island, except for an old legend.
The legend goes that the people of Warship Island are descendants of Lost Island which sank into the sea a thousand years ago, which was also home to the millennial dragons. The bones of these dragons are called dragonite, also known as the Elixir of Immortality. The Straw Hats say that it does not explain why the marines are after the girl and that they must be overlooking something and that this must be connected to the legend somehow.
Bokuden then recounts the legend from the very beginning which bores Apis causing her to leave her grandfather's house. The old man goes on for a while and some of the crew members have already fallen asleep. Luffy wakes up in hunger and leaves. On the way out, he smells the pork buns that the old man was preparing earlier and goes towards the smell. However, Apis is putting all of them inside a sack. Afraid of being caught, Apis hides and is about to hit Luffy in the head, but he stumbles to the floor and falls back to sleep before Apis can hit him.
Nami notices that Luffy has been gone for a while and decides to also sneak out and go look for him as an excuse. She finds him inside the kitchen, and she notices a trail left by the sack Apis was pulling. Luffy and Nami follow the trail which leads them across a cliff onto the other side of the mountain towards a cave.
Inside the cave, Apis is talking to someone she calls as Grandpa Ryu. She recounts how Luffy and his crew saved her from the marines. She proceeds to give him the pork buns she brought with her knowing that he must have been hungry. Luffy and Nami hear her talking to someone and Luffy approaches her asking her where she took the pork buns. Apis is asking them to stay away, shielding something with her small body. Looking closer, Nami and Luffy see that Grandpa Ryu is actually a dragon. Luffy is excited by the sight of a legendary dragon and asks him where he comes from. While there is no audible response, Luffy seems to understand the dragon. Apis tells Luffy that Ryu is telling her that Luffy can be his friend ang that he can tell that he is a good person. Apis says that she is able to read Ryu's mind and asks how Luffy is able to understand him to which Luffy replies that he does not know and that it just happened.
Nami asks if Apis got her ability from a devil fruit. She answers that she ate the Hiso Hiso no Mi once and since then, she has been able to read the mind of any animal. She recounts how she met Ryu, that one day while playing in the fields, she heard a voice in the mountains. She followed the voice into the cave and saw Ryu. He was helpless and had used up the last of his energy searching for his friends. He told her that he got separated from them on their way to their dragon's nest in Lost Island. Nami says that she thought the island was under water, but Apis says that Ryu is certain that it will resurface any day now. The problem, however, is that Ryu does not remember where the Lost Island is located because of old age and Apis has been helping him by researching as to where it may be located. Some marines were in Warship Island, and she made the mistake of asking them if they knew where it was. The marines saw her pendant that is shaped like a millennial dragon claw and took her to question her everything she knew about Lost Island's whereabouts because of the dragonite it may contain, but she refused to tell them anything. Apis is determined to help Ryu get back to his dragon's nest as this will get him his energy back. After hearing this, Luffy says that he is going to help Ryu go back to his home. Nami protests at first because of the legend that the island is underwater and that they have no map to the said island, but Luffy is determined to help the dragon, to which she gives in.
Eric is seen going towards Warship Island and is convinced that due to Apis' possession of the pendant, she must know everything about the dragonite and its whereabouts.","Apis, Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Monkey D. Luffy, Sanji, Bokuden, Ryu, Nelson Royale, Eric",Hiso Hiso no Mi

Also, Eric has been following them throughout the sea.","After the Straw Hats’ escape, the Marines prepare to go after them. Eric is not too worried as he feels that they will lead him to the millennial dragons. As a marine tries to report updates to Commodore Nelson, Eric stops him as he wants to keep all the dragonite for himself. Nelson, nonetheless, receives updates and is angered that Eric is keeping a millennial dragon from him. Nelson then orders to deploy a fleet towards Warship Island.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats tow Ryu in search of Lost Island. Luffy checks on him, but the dragon has fallen asleep. While Apis is serving lunch, the hot meal spills on Ryu’s head. This wakes him and jogs his memory. He remembers where the Lost Island is, which is east of Warship Island. The Straw Hats head there right away.
Luffy sees “smoke” in the distance. The Going Merry draws nearer to what seems to be their ship’s reflection. Luffy investigates and is “sucked” into his own reflection. The Marines who were after them, see the Merry disappear into thin air. Eric prepares to go after them.
The Going Merry is now surrounded by fog so thick that it is hard to see. Usopp comments that what they saw was a mirage which Nami confirms. The weather changes and they are caught in a storm. The strong waves cause the ropes towing Ryu to break. Zoro quickly catches the ropes and Luffy pulls Ryu to safety. Usopp spots an island at the eye of the storm and Nami decides that they should head towards it.
They reach the island and Nami remarks that an island hidden by a mirage and surrounded by stormy seas must have been why no one has never found it. They haul Ryu to the island, but the dragon is still unsure if this is even the Lost Island. They decide to head to the top of the mountain so they can find his nest. They reach a building with a dragon emblem and look for a door to enter. Apis sees a hole on the wall with the same shape as her pendant. They believe that it might be the key to opening the building. Before they could open the door, the ground below them collapses and they all fall into what seems to be a temple. They look up the ceiling and see various ancient paintings which could show clues as to where the real Lost Island is.","Eric, Nelson Royale, Ryu, Monkey D.

The ground beneath them crumbles, leaving them in an underground area. Luffy notices a piece of collapsed ceiling that features a painting of a Sennenryu. At first, Apis believes that the Dragon's Nest was located on this island, but upon further inspection of the ceiling paintings, Nami deduces that the Dragon's Nest was located back at Warship Island, but sank into the sea. They are convinced that the island was actually the royal court mentioned in Bokuden's story.
Apis asks Ryu where the Dragon's Nest was. After watching a flock of birds flying in the building, Ryu finally remembers that the Dragon's Nest was indeed located east of the summit at Warship Island.
Eric appears. It is revealed he had been listening to the Straw Hat Pirates' conversation and now knows where the Dragon's Nest is. Luffy attempts to break out of the building, successfully breaking a hole into the wall. However, Eric leaps into the building and fights Zoro, while the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates, along with Ryu and Apis, escape and ride on Ryu's cart.

To everyone astonishment, Nami figures out that sennenryus are not called by that name because of their life span, but because they are migratory creatures that come to the nest every thousand years. That nest is Lost Island, named like that because of the huge time that passes before the island is available. Sennenryus start to land and you see some of their ancestors fossilized, covered in corals. That is the so-called Dragonite that Nelson and Eric was searching for.
Almost finally, Ryu is laying on the ground with his head submerged on water. Apis screams because she does not want to lose him. Luffy tells Apis that Ryu died making his dream come true, but Apis responds screaming that Ryu was a liar, that he promised her once he could get to the nest, he will get better.

Eric proposes splitting the Dragonite in two parts, but Nami points out that nothing useful can be obtained by destroying the fossilized Sennenryu. He agrees to that extent but adds that there is more than enough Dragonite in the alive Sennenryu. Apis refuses and runs directly to him, in that moment he creates an attack directed to her, so Usopp quickly reacts and charges to Apis, saving her from the attack. Zoro partially unsheathes his Wado Ichimonji but Luffy says that he will be taking care of him, just as he promised Ryu just before his death.
Luffy starts the battle with his Gomu Gomu no Pistol but is dodged by Eric and counterattacked. Eric makes a lot of damage to Luffy and claims that that ""rubber man"" cannot beat him. After that, Eric starts making a lot of attacks and asks how will Luffy evade them, to which Luffy responds that he will not evade them and runs towards the attacks. After being cut in different places from the attacks of Eric, he manages to grab him by his arms and hit him with his Gomu Gomu no Kane, breaking Eric's distinctive eyeglasses and bringing up some blood. After the Bell technique, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Bazooka and blows away Eric.
The Straw Hats are ready to depart and villager are there, including Apis and his grandfather. Luffy asks Apis if she wants to come with them, to which she replies that she would like to but she will stay in the village to protect the Dragon's Nest. Usopp responds that the next time the Sennenryu return would be in 1000 years. She replies that surely she will not be able to see the next generation of Sennenryu but surely the kids of their kids will. The Straw Hats set sail and say goodbye. Then Usopp asks the rest of the crew if Apis will be fine and Sanji, Luffy and Zoro say she is gonna be okay.
The crew seem to be in the direction of the Grand Line but the map that Nami is seeing seems strange to her. They discuss the possibilities and Zoro does not believe that the map is accurate. Nami gets the idea that a current might be what lets someone pass through the mountain by Usopp's phrase and they go along with it. Nami spots what might be the entrance for the mountain and Luffy orders Sanji and Usopp to set the rudder in the direction of what might be the entrance. The controller for the rudder breaks because of the strong current, Luffy jumps out of the ship and uses Gomu Gomu no Fusen so the caravel will not crash against the arcs that are along the entrance in the mountain. The caravel passes and almost at the final of the current, Eric shows up and the pirates point out that any false move and Eric will tear the ship apart. Nami warns him there is Dragonite besides him, he falls into the trap and she kicks his leg, throwing him to the current.

Giant Whale Laboon Appears,21-Mar-01,"Upon entering the Grand Line, the Straw Hat Pirates, helpless because of their broken helm, are promptly swallowed by a giant whale named Laboon. Luffy gets separated from the rest of the crew, and the Straw Hats find some very odd structures inside the whale, as well as that they are not alone in their predicament.","The episode opens with the Straw Hat Pirates riding down Reverse Mountain into the Grand Line, when they are suddenly engulfed in a fog, but they didn’t seem to mind. Just then, Zoro hears a strange noise, though Nami says it’s probably just the wind. Then Sanji claims he sees a mountain at the end of the path they were heading down. However, when the fog clears, they find out that it wasn’t a mountain; it was a huge whale! At the rate they were going, they’d hit it straight on and crash. Zoro tells them to try to head for an opening off to the left, but Usopp says that the helm is still broken from before they arrived at the mountain. Zoro heads over to help, but then Luffy gets a ""good"" idea, and heads down below deck. Meanwhile, Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji are all trying to pull the helm in the direction they want to, but it won’t budge. They were all about the crash… When suddenly, Luffy fires a cannon! While everyone is shocked, Luffy asked if they stopped. While it did slow down, the ship still crashed into the whale, but the only thing broken was the head, to which, Luffy was outraged (it was his special seat).
All the while, the whale didn’t react at all. Zoro yelled out to make a run for it while it still didn’t notice them. While they were rowing past its eye, Luffy, in a burst of fury, punched it directly in the eye. After a few seconds, the whale finally looked down at them. Luffy kept shouting out how he’ll kick its ass, the rest of the crew kept telling him to shut up. The whale then began to suck in the water around its mouth, and with it, the Straw Hats. Luffy fell overboard, but grabbed onto one of the whale’s teeth before he could hit the water. He then began to climb up the whale, as the rest of the crew was swallowed alive. Luffy, who was now sitting on top of the whale, began pounding it and telling it to let his friends go, but the whale was beginning to submerge underwater. Luffy began yelling louder and louder, until he finally noticed a door on top of the whale…
Meanwhile, the rest of the crew found themselves… in front of a small island in the middle of green waters, with a clear blue-sky overhead. Suddenly, a giant squid pops up out of the water, but someone (or something) that was apparently living on the small island quickly killed it. Nami wanted to go home, and Usopp wished Luffy were there; ""he’d know what to do"". Nami then began to wonder what happened to him; at the same time, Luffy found himself in some sort of passageway, very confused. Back at the small island, someone walked out of the house on the island, and revealed himself to be an old man.
The Straw Hats stared at the old man, and the old man stared back, as he pulled in the giant squid and started to walk over to a chair and began to read the newspaper. Sanji yelled at him, telling him to say something. Usopp then spurted out that they'd give him a fight he wanted. Suddenly, a few dramatic shots are shown, and then the old man suggests not to fight, otherwise someone would have died. Nami and Usopp panicked at this, though Zoro and Sanji looked calm. Then Sanji questioned who would be the one dying, and the old man simply replied that he would be the one. Sanji started getting very frustrated with the old man, but Zoro calmed him down, and tried talking to the old man, himself. He asked him where they were and who was he. Suddenly, the same dramatic sequence happened again, and the old man replied by saying if they want to know something about someone, it’s only proper to introduce one’s self first. However, before Zoro could introduce himself the old man already said his name was Crocus, he is the keeper of the Twin Capes Lighthouse, he’s 71 and a half years old, a Gemini, and his blood type is AB. With this, Zoro got frustrated, too.
Crocus then goes on to say that this is his ""one-man resort"", and that they were saying such rude things to him. Usopp, again, questions if they are really in a whale’s belly. Nami begins to panic, again, for worry of being digested. Crocus then begins to go through the dramatic sequence, again, but the Straw Hats tell him to stop doing that, and Crocus ask them to appreciate a good running gag. He then points out an exit doorway, to which, the Straw Hats find strange; what is a giant door doing in a whale’s stomach? And why is it on the sky? It was then that they realized that the scenery was painted on. Crocus admitted that was his doing, and he liked having fun, to which Usopp started getting annoyed with him.
Then suddenly, everything started to shake and rock around, with Crocus saying that ""it"" started. It was then Nami noticed that the island was actually made of iron, and chained down. Usopp asked what started and Crocus replied that the whale, Laboon, has started to ram against the Red Line. Nami then came to the realization that the whale is in pain, remembering that it has many scars on it, and it bellowed into the sky. Usopp and Nami then came to the conclusion that Crocus might be trying to kill the whale from the inside out, Zoro, however, says that they should just get out of there, before the ship dissolves. Meanwhile, elsewhere inside the whale, two mysterious individuals were sneaking around carrying guns…
The Straw Hats tried to reach the doorway, but the waves were too big. Just then, Crocus dived into the liquid, and began swimming off deep into the stomach. Meanwhile, Luffy was beginning to get knocked around with the whale ramming into the mountainside. He then fell into a tunnel, with possibly the same liquid flowing between two walkways. While Luffy was questioning what it could be, the tunnel slanted downward, and Luffy fell, yet again. Meanwhile, back with the two individuals from before, who revealed themselves to be Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday, Mr. 9 commented that their infiltration so far has been a complete success. They stand on the other side of the same doorway, Mr. 9 saying that they need to eliminate the ""old geezer"", for the whale’s sake. Miss Wednesday agreed, saying that their town needs the whale.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the door, Crocus emerged from it, and began climbing up the side of the whale’s stomach. Back on the other side, Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday were about to get through, when Luffy fell on top of them, and they flew through the doorway and fell into the digestive juice. Meanwhile, Crocus walked off to the disclosed area, where he kept a gigantic needle filled with sedative, and injected some into the whale in order to make him stop. While he says this, he ""talks"" to the whale, saying no matter how hard he hits the wall, he won’t break through it.
Meanwhile, back with the Straw Hats, they saved Luffy, along with the two individuals, and Zoro asked who they were. Crocus then entered the stomach again, telling the two that they won’t lay a finger on Laboon (the whale). The two said that killing the whale was their mission, and they won't let him interfere anymore. They immediately shot two cannonballs from their bazookas, in order to rip a hole in the whale's stomach, but Crocus ran over and took the cannonball dead on. The two began to laugh at him, saying that they’ll kill the whale to feed their town, when Luffy suddenly knocked them both out cold, saying he just had to hit them.
Later on, Crocus thanked Luffy for helping him, but Luffy said he didn’t help; he just didn’t want to see that happen. Nami asked who those two were and what they were doing inside the whale. Crocus explained that the two were from a nearby town, and they want the whale’s meat, saying that Laboon (the whale) could feed their town for two to three years. He also explained that Laboon is an Island Whale, which inhabit the West Blue and are the largest species of whale in the world. He also says there’s a reason why he keeps bashing his head against the Red Line, and why he bellows at the mountain. He explains that he is a whale with a heart like a person, and the episode ends with him has been waiting for a certain group of pirates for 50 years…","Monkey D.

Episode 63,A Man's Promise! Luffy and the Whale Vow to Meet Again,21-Mar-01,"After hearing the story of Laboon the whale, Luffy comes up with a clever solution to his problems. From Laboon's caretaker, Crocus, the crew learns more about the Grand Line and how to navigate through it via Log Pose, since compasses are useless there. The crew finally decide to travel to Whisky Peak.","Crocus begins to tell the story of Laboon to the Straw Hat Pirates. He explains that Laboon has been waiting for a group of pirates for over fifty years. Fifty years ago, Laboon came along with a group of pirates known as the Rumbar Pirates. The pirates did not wish to bring the young whale in their dangerous journey and wanted to leave it in West Blue, where it originally inhabited but it had followed the pirates on their journey. To Laboon, the pirates were like its own family. The Rumbar Pirates stayed in the Reverse Mountain for a few months to repair their ship, during which Crocus became friends with them. Once they were ready to leave on their journey, they asked Crocus to look after Laboon and left him in the care of Crocus promising to return back after three years. The captain of the ship asked Laboon to wait for them, and promised him that no matter what happens in their journey, they would come for him and he is still their friend.
The scene shifts back to Straw Hat Pirates. They finally understand why Laboon has been bellowing and ramming his head against the wall. Crocus reveals that he is a doctor and has been treating Laboon's wound from the inside. Luffy immediately asks him to become the doctor of his crew to which Crocus declines reasoning that he is no longer as young as he used to be. Crocus finally let them out of Laboon through a tunnel and the Straw Hat Pirates briefly discuss on the possibility of the Rumbar Pirates death. Usopp declines on the possibility of their death and believes that they are indeed alive and will come back for Laboon. Crocus however says that the pirates possibly ran away from Grand Line and will not be returning back for Laboon. The Straw Hat Pirates further discuss that the pirates running away and not fulfilling their promise of coming back for Laboon, and question Crocus why he did not tell Laboon about the pirates' betrayal, as he is perfectly capable of understanding human speech. Crocus tells them that he indeed tried but the whale refused to listen to him. Sanji tells him that since Crocus himself got betrayed, Laboon should not be his problem anymore but Crocus tells him that he is not going to let the whale die as he has forged a certain relationship with it.
Suddenly, Luffy breaks the mast off Going Merry and strikes the whale with it. Laboon retaliates and begins fighting with Luffy. Luffy stops the whale and declares that it is a draw between them. Luffy labels Laboon as his rival and promises to have a rematch with him after they had completed their journey. He then asks Laboon to wait for him and not to heal himself as they will be fighting soon. Luffy then paints a Jolly Roger on Laboon's face.
Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 escape from the Straw Hat Pirates' ship but they drop their Log Pose, which Luffy picks up. They decide to return back to their boss as the time limit to their mission was over. Suddenly, Mr. 13 and Miss Friday, the Unluckies fly over them and drop a bomb on them.
Nami discovers that the usual compass and common sense does not work on Grand Line because of the magnetic fields of various minerals found on Grand Line. Crocus says that they need to have a Log Pose in order to advance on their adventure. Luffy reveals that he found a Log Pose on the ship. Crocus then tells them that Log Pose readapts to the magnetic field of the various islands and will point them in the right direction, which when followed eventually leads to Laugh Tale. Usopp questions if the One Piece is there, to which Crocus replies that only one man and his crew has ever reached there, the Pirate King Gol D. Roger and mentions that One Piece is a myth and no one really knows if it exists or not. Luffy reveals that they will know for sure when they reach there, so it does not really matter. While they are conversing, Luffy eats all the food and Sanji kicks him for not saving any for others. The Log Pose suddenly breaks and Nami kicks both. Crocus says that he would give his Log Pose for saving Laboon. Later, Laboon brings out Sanji, Luffy, Mr.9 and Miss Wednesday out of the sea. Mr.9 and Miss Wednesday requests to go on a journey with the Straw Hat Crew to Whisky Peak, their homeland. Crocus tells the crew to leave them be for trying to hurt Laboon but Luffy agrees to take them to their hometown. The crew then continue on their journey to Whisky Peak and the episode ends with Crocus saying goodbye to the Straw Hat Crew and remembering Gol D. Roger.","Laboon, Crocus, Monkey D.

Zoro then learns the truth about the people of Whisky Peak.","The Straw Hat Pirates travel along with Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 in the Going Merry to get them to Whisky Peak. Nami is surprised by the weather condition on the Grand Line because it changes randomly and drastically. She tells the crew that they are heading in the wrong direction and the crew follow her orders so they can get to Whisky Peak. The Straw Hat Pirates arrive at their destination, while Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 get off the ship and start swimming immediately after they see Whisky Peak.

Episode 65,Exploding Santoryu! Zoro vs. Baroque Works!,15-Apr-01,Zoro finally defeats the Millions and the agents and Nami wakes up and went to find treasure that led her outside. But Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine arrive to arrest Mr. 8 and Miss Wednesday as they are important members of Arabasta kingdom and they knew the Boss' secret.,"The Billions of the Baroque Works confused on why Zoro disappeared, they started to look for him when suddenly Zoro was right in the middle of the crowd looking up at the roof he was from. The people around him started shooting but they ended up shooting each other as Zoro once again disappeared. Mr. 8 commanded them to kill him because he is just one swordsman. Suddenly, Zoro was back-to-back with Mr. 8 and Zoro slides his sword through Mr. 8's hair. Zoro asked Mr. 8 if adding only one grave is enough. The Billions found Zoro on Mr. 8's back and as they were to shoot him, Mr. 8 shot them with his trumpet fearing he would be shot, too.
It is revealed where Zoro is disappearing to as he is seen hiding on a wall. Mr. 9 was convinced that they have to deal with him themselves. Meanwhile, in the bar, Nami is awake and was really not drunk. She discovered that the ""welcoming town"" is a nest of bounty hunters. Outside, as Zoro attempts to test Yubashiri and Sandai Kitetsu, his 2 new swords, a Billion on the roof of the building Zoro was hiding found him and shot him. Zoro dodged the shot and went inside the house but many Billions was outside and started shooting him. He flipped a table and went behind it like a shield. He started using Yubashiri and cut the people on the door. He appreciated its lightness. He went up a ladder to a roof of another building and found a Billion with a bazooka who shot him immediately the instant he went up. But Zoro dodged it quickly.
Miss Monday, on another roof behind Zoro, threw a barrel of wine at him and Zoro turned around and cut it in 4 pieces. He said that the wine was wasted as the 4 cut parts of the barrel hit the Billions behind him. Another Billion attempted to hammer him behind but his other sword, Sandai Kitetsu, rashly responded without Zoro commanding it. Zoro is now convinced on why it is cursed. A child tried to attack him and lost but his ""mother"" went to him praying to God for divine protection when suddenly they put up a cross and smoke went out of its center. The nun and the child had easily lost as Zoro was behind them already, but he used the back of his sword. The Billions went inside the bar and stepped on Usopp and Luffy. Usopp woke up but slept again and asleep Sanji held his arm when they were spread as he mistook it as a lady's arm. Nami is searching for treasure but she only found little.
Zoro is at the very top of a building and the Billions thought they cornered him but as a Billion climbed up a ladder, he flipped the ladder and jumped to another roof and did Hawk Wave to the Billions there. Billions started jumping to him but he walked away and warned the Billions that he cut a hole on the roof and the Billions did fell down. Zoro nearly got hit by a ladder because of Miss Monday. Miss Monday threw the ladder and wore her brass knuckles. She put Zoro down the ground and did Kairiki Meriken (""Superhuman Strength Fist"") punching Zoro on the head. The roof cracked and the agents told it was ""The End"". As they were about to walk away, Miss Monday screamed and Zoro is seen holding her head with only one hand effortlessly. Mr. 8 said that the Marines made a mistake on the wanted posters and they thought that Zoro was the captain worth 30,000,000. Mr. 9 tells Zoro that the lower the number of codename, the stronger the member. With the three of them given a single digit codename, he told him that the Billions he took out was not close to their strength.
Mr. 8 tried to shoot him with shotgun trumpet and Mr. 9 went up while Miss Wednesday called for Karoo. Karoo let out his hand thinking that Miss Wednesday wants to handshake but Miss Wednesday told her to ""come here"". Miss Wednesday told him to run but he sat instead. Mr. 9 is on the roof higher than Zoro's position and did Nekketsu Nine Konjou Bat (""Hot Blooded 9 Guts Bat"") flipping over while going down and brought out 2 black baseball bats. But with one sword, Zoro can easily hae the advantage. Zoro taunted Mr. 9 and he attempted to jump back to prepare but instead fell down because it was the edge of the roof already. Zoro asked if there is anyone better and Miss Wednesday, behind Zoro, answered that would be her while calling Zoro Mr. Bushido (a warrior code of honor). She did Miwaku no Kousui Dance (""Alluring Perfume Dance""). Zoro knelt down because the perfume was very stinky and Miss Wednesday brought out her Kujakki Slasher (""Peacock Slasher""). Miss Wednesday commanded Karoo to run but he went straight past Zoro and fell to the ground. Mr. 8 tried to shoot him but he dodged at the same time went through a hole and went out the building. Mr. 9 woke up and did Kattobase Shikomi Bat (""Home-Run Training Bat"") and one of his bats extended and tied up Zoro's arm. Miss Wednesday told Zoro not to move or Luffy will be killed as Luffy is held still sleeping and Miss Wednesday is holding a knife. Cannons started to pluck out of Mr. 8's hair and shot Zoro. Zoro dragged Mr. 9 and got shot instead and dragged him to Miss Wednesday and Karoo.
He jumped at Luffy's very fat stomach and went up to the roof where Mr. 8 stands slashing through him. Luffy woke up wondering why he is outside but went asleep again. As the Unluckies was going to attack some escaping Billions, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine stopped them and instead attacked the Billions bombing them. Mr. 8 and the others were found by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine and insulted on how pathetic they were. Mr. 9 thanked them thinking they were here to back them up but their real mission was to eliminate the agents who are important members of a certain kingdom because they know the Boss' ""secret"". Mr. 9 told them that he was not really a king and his crown was just his style but they were referring to Miss Wednesday who is the currently missing Princess of Arabasta Kingdom. Mr. 8, now revealed to be the Captain of Royal Guard of Arabasta named Igaram, shot them with his cannons. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine was unharmed and told Igaram and Princess Nefertari Vivi (Miss Wednesday) that they are under arrest.","Mr. 9, Igaram, Nefertari Vivi, Miss Monday, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 66,A Serious Fight! Luffy vs. Zoro: The Baffling Duel!,22-Apr-01,"Luffy, without knowing that the town is full of bounty hunters, engaged in a battle with Zoro, after Zoro attacked the 'kind' people of this town. Meanwhile, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine, two Officer Agents, headed for Princess Vivi, after learning that she discovered the head of the organization's true name.","Igaram, Head of Security of Alabasta, continued to launch his assault on Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine, who have discovered both his identity and that of Miss Wednesday: Nefertari Vivi, Royal Princess of Alabasta. Zoro observed the attack from the rooftop, musing about Luffy being trapped in the crossfire and having to go rescue him. As Igaram continued his attack, he yells for Vivi to escape, but she can only watch in terror.
Amidst the smoke and gunfire, Mr. 5 launched a projectile at Igaram, who is promptly consumed in a powerful explosion as both Vivi and Mr. 9 watch in shock. The smoke began to clear, and Igaram, severely injured, fell. Vivi called out to him in terror, but was interrupted by Miss Valentine, who attacked Vivi after telling her it is useless. Vivi escaped with nothing but a broken hairband, and attempted to launch a counter-attack with her Peacock Slashers on Miss Valentine, who promptly floated out of range while laughing, and returned to Mr. 5's side. As Vivi seethed, Mr. 9 expressed his amazement at his partner's royal status; Vivi promptly yelled at him for doing so in the midst of a dangerous situation. Zoro, meanwhile, took the chance to drag off a still sleeping, still bloated Luffy. Igaram, still somehow conscious, begged Vivi to abandon him and escape, for the sake of their home Alabasta. Mr. 5 proceeded to pick his nose while calmly stating that it is impossible for Vivi to escape. Enraged, Vivi drew her other Peacock Slasher and challenged the Baroque Works agent. Before she can attack however, Mr. 9 stands between her and the pair of assassins. While admitting confusion at the situation, Mr. 9 recounts how long he and Vivi have worked together, and told her to run as he buys her some time. As Vivi thanked him, Mr. 9 says his goodbyes and proceeds to charge at Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine with his acrobatics.
Mr. 5 stated that all that is required of agents is to do their jobs effectively while he pulled out a booger from his nose, chastising Mr. 9 for forming a friendship with his partner. When Mr. 9 attempted to attack, Mr. 5 aims the booger and launched it at Mr. 9, which proceeded to explode and send Mr. 9 flying clear into the river. Vivi watched this in horror, while Zoro observed in bewilderment. While Zoro was distracted, Igaram grabs Zoro's leg, which surprised the pirate swordsman. Igaram stated that he has a ""most unfair"" request of Zoro, but required someone of his strength. Igaram continued, saying that both of the agents have Devil Fruit powers, and that he Igaram was hopelessly outmatched against them. As such, Igaram begged Zoro to protect Vivi in his place. All the while, Zoro was struggling to get Igaram to let go of his leg.
Miss Valentine laughed at the situation while Mr. 5 picked his nose, and Vivi hopped on Karoo's back, commanding him to run. Miss Valentine commented on this, while Mr. 5 states that Vivi will not get far before chasing after her, Miss Valentine followed right behind him.
Despite his injuries, Igaram continued to beg Zoro to protect Vivi, promising riches in return for doing so. Zoro angrily refused, mentioning how Igaram and his group had just been attempting to kill Zoro. However, Nami interjected, having overheard the conversation from a rooftop- and the mention of a reward. Nami stated that she will take the job, but only in return for 1 billion. Igaram was shocked at Nami's price, while Zoro and Nami converse. Zoro expressed surprise that Nami was awake, while she retorts that it had all been an act, not trusting ""a town that welcomes Pirates"". She then turned her attention to Igaram, and said that if he wanted Vivi to escape alive, he had better promise the reward of 1 billion. Igaram stated that his status prevented him from offering such a reward, but Nami retorts by emphasizing the danger to Vivi's life. Desperate, Igaram stated that while he cannot make any promises, the crew could negotiate a reward with Vivi herself. Nami mentions that this would require keeping up their part of the deal, but Igaram pleaded desperately. Nami relented, and proceeded to order Zoro to save Vivi, much to the swordsman's anger, saying that he is not going to get involved in Nami's schemes. Nami attempted to explain business to Zoro, but he refuses to fall for her explanation. Nami makes light of the situation, while Zoro vented his frustration at her attempting to order him around just as she took advantage of Sanji. During their conversation, Luffy finally wakes from his slumber.
Nami insults Zoro and says that he is just afraid of losing, while Zoro is quickly losing what remains of his patience. A bloated Luffy, still half-asleep, walks by the two obliviously in order to find the facilities. Nami then brings up the loan she gave Zoro, but he counters by mentioning that he did not even spend any of it. Nonetheless, Nami counters by saying that he promised to pay her back in 300% interest, bringing his due to 300,000. Zoro is shocked that Nami expects him to pay her back when he did not spend any of the money in the first place, but Nami persists. She then proceeds to question whether or not Zoro can even keep one little promise (apparently hitting a sore spot), leaving Zoro shocked, furious, and silent. While Zoro grumbles about Nami dying a horrible death, he nonetheless relents and leaves to find Vivi. Igaram muses about his own apparent uselessness, but Nami comforts him by telling Igaram how strong Zoro is. Nonetheless, Igaram morbidly goes on about how Alabasta would be doomed if Vivi died, confusing Nami.
Vivi and Karoo continue to flee, with the intention of stealing a ship and fleeing back to Alabasta.
A still-bloated Luffy relieves himself in a river before intending to go back to sleep, but comes across the carnage that Zoro left behind.
Vivi and Karoo continue running away, but are promptly intercepted by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine. Vivi and Karoo run a different route and are met by Miss Monday, who explains that they can reach the ships by taking the path behind her, explaining that she will hold off Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine while Vivi makes her escape. Vivi hesitates, but Miss Monday explains that the loss to Zoro means punishment already awaits, so she might as well go down while protecting her friend. She then yells at Vivi to stop waiting around and flee, saying that otherwise Igaram and Mr. 9's sacrifices would be in vain. Vivi thanks Miss Monday before she and Karoo run away again, leaving Miss Monday to face Mr. 5. While Mr. 5 muses about both her and Mr. 9's defection, Miss Monday remains determined to prevent him from passing. Miss Valentine mocks Miss Monday's resolve, while Mr. 5 rushes Miss Monday, calling her a disgrace. Miss Monday attempts to attack, but Mr. 5 dodges and clotheslines her, causing a powerful explosion. Hearing the explosion, Vivi temporarily halts her escape to look back as her friend is defeated, seeing an inferno. She can only stare in utter horror as her friend got beaten.
Vivi is shocked at the brutality, while Mr. 5 explains his powers are from the Bomu Bomu no Mi and that he has yet to fail a mission. Miss Valentine then explains her own powers, originating from the Kiro Kiro no Mi. Miss Valentine then uses her powers to turn herself into a living missile and slam down on Miss Monday with the weight of 10,000 kilograms. Upon standing up, the pair condescendingly state that it is futile for Vivi to escape, and that she does not stand a chance. Vivi however, remains determined to return to Alabasta and save her kingdom. Mr. 5 prepares to attack, but Zoro intercepts, saving a shocked Vivi. Vivi, believing Zoro to still be an enemy, prepares to attack him, but Zoro cuts Vivi's weapon and holds the edge of his blade at her throat, followed by explaining that he is here to help and she needs to calm down.
Meanwhile, Nami and Igaram continue talking, with Nami questioning just what Baroque Works is. Igaram hesitates, but then explains that the Baroque Works is a crime syndicate, specializing in sabotage, assassination, and bounty-hunting, and so secretive that none of the agents know the boss' name or face, but will nonetheless act on his orders. Nami questions this logic, but Igaram goes on to say that Baroque Work's primary goal is to create a Utopia, and that those who do their part get a higher standing in said nation. He then continues, explaining the codename and rank system within Baroque Works.
Miss Valentine guesses that Zoro is the one who defeated all of the ""lowly employees"" in Whisky Peak, while Mr. 5 questions as to why Zoro would want to get involved in protecting Vivi. Zoro simply states that he has his own reasons, while Mr. 5 says that they will have to eliminate Zoro for his interference. Zoro and Mr. 5 prepare to fight, but are interrupted by the shout of an enraged Luffy. While Vivi is confused, Zoro states that while glad to have Luffy's assistance, he can handle the attackers. However, Luffy proceeds to yell threats at Zoro, much to the swordsman's shock and confusion. While Zoro questions what Luffy could be asking, Luffy angrily explains how he came across the men Zoro fought, and was tricked into believing Zoro attacked unprovoked. Zoro attempts to explain, but Luffy ignores him and yells at Zoro to fight him. Vivi comments on Luffy's lack of intelligence (to Karoo's agreement), while Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine discuss letting the two kill each other off. Zoro continues his attempts at explanation, but Luffy will not have and attacks. Zoro dodges Luffy's assault while attempting to calm down his captain. Miss Valentine and Mr. 5 muse from the sidelines before deciding to return to their mission: eliminating Princess Vivi. However, Zoro kicks the bloated rubber man into the pair, sending the three of them flying. Having had enough interference, Mr. 5 explains his intentions to kill both Luffy and Zoro, and attacks Luffy while Zoro and Vivi watch from a distance. In the midst of the explosions, Miss Valentine flies up and prepares to attack Zoro and Vivi. Vivi tells Zoro to flee, but Zoro interrupts her. Luffy then steps out of the smoke, having digested the food that he ate and dragging a beaten and bloodied Mr. 5. Vivi is utterly shocked at Luffy's victory over such a powerful foe. Luffy turns his attention back to Zoro, who tries to explain the situation. Miss Valentine floats above the swordsman and tries to explain her powers, but becomes quite angry when she finds she is being ignored.
Luffy does not believe Zoro's explanation (based on the concept that enemies would not give them such tasty food); Zoro is done attempting to explain, and casually dodges Miss Valentine's attack attempt, and prepares to fight Luffy. While Vivi is confused, the crew mates charge each other, launching a Gomu Gomu no Bazooka and Oni Giri respectively, the attacks cancelling each other out as the two grapple. Zoro and Luffy decide to test steel against rubber, and Zoro launches a Tatsu Maki, flinging Luffy into the air. To Zoro's surprise, Luffy is able to launch a Gomu Gomu no Pistol, landing a direct hit as they both slam into walls. Vivi ponders the situation as she and Karoo warily tread the battlefield, before both Luffy and Zoro break out of the rubble and resume their attacks. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine observe the ferocious battle, Mr. 5 commenting that the pair are making fools of them on their own turf, and that Baroque Works will be shamed if they fail their mission. The two charge headlong into the battle, but are promptly disposed of by the captain and Zoro for interrupting their battle.","Roronoa Zoro, Igaram, Nefertari Vivi, Mr. 9, Mr. 5, Miss Valentine, Monkey D.

Luffy Pirates Depart,29-Apr-01,"Luffy's crew manages to become targets of Crocodile, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and decide to escort Princess Vivi to her hometown. They also meet Miss All Sunday, the assistant of Crocodile. While she attempts to offer them an Eternal Pose to an island near the Arabasta Kingdom, Luffy breaks it instead of allowing an enemy to decide their destination.","Having defeated Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine, Luffy and Zoro turn back to each other, prepared to resume their own battle. Vivi and Karoo watch helplessly, still shocked that they beat a Baroque Works Officer Agent pair so easily. But before they can strike their first blows at each other, Nami knocks them both silly. While Luffy finally understands why Zoro was fighting Whisky Peak's denizens, Nami presses Vivi on a 1 billion contract to return her to the Arabasta Kingdom. Vivi says it is unlikely she will be able to pay due to the brewing civil strife in her home kingdom. She had learned a few years before that Baroque Works was manipulating the populace of Arabasta for the purpose of usurping her father, the King. She asked Igaram, one of her closest allies, to help her infiltrate the organization and find out who was pulling the strings.
She is reluctant to reveal who the leader is since doing so would expose her and put her on his hit list. However, in her growing nervousness, she inadvertently reveals who the leader is: Mr. 0 is Crocodile, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
As she utters his name, the Unluckies, Mr. 13 and Miss Friday, stand in silence, perched above them atop a brick wall. After Mr. 13 makes composite sketches of Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, the Unluckies fly off. Nami is enraged by this turn of events, but shakes off out of anger for getting them into this. Vivi repeatedly apologizes sincerely for accidentally telling them, saying it just slipped out, but Nami is still not satisfied. While Zoro and Luffy are excited to potentially be on a Warlord's hit list, Nami laments being in such mortal danger the moment they enter the Grand Line. While they try to figure out what to do, Igaram returns. He has arrived dressed vaguely like Vivi and carrying three dummies, which are supposed to be the present Straw Hats. He will use Vivi's Eternal Pose to get straight to Arabasta, and will act as a decoy. He recommends that Vivi island-hop to Arabasta with the Straw Hats using their Log Pose, making it harder for Baroque Works to trace them. Igaram says that before Crocodile became a World Government-sanctioned privateer, he had a bounty of 80 million, so he is highly dangerous. Luffy eagerly accepts the challenge.
Shortly after Igaram sets sail, his ship explodes in a fireball even bigger than Whisky Peak itself, incinerating the decoys and sending the Eternal Pose into the water. Angered, Luffy runs to the Going Merry to set sail. Nami quickly comforts Vivi, who presumes Igaram to be dead. She promises that her crew can easily handle Baroque Works, and they will get her home. Luffy finds Sanji and Usopp, grabs them, and drags them to the ship. Vivi wonders where Karoo went, but he turns up on the ship already. While they prepare to sail, a woman comments on how foolish the decoy was. Vivi directs them down a river to get to sea, saying that Baroque Works has a total of over 2,000 agents with several bases along the way to Arabasta.
As dawn breaks, the Going Merry gets out to open water in a light fog. An unknown voice joins the ship, and they see someone stowing away, the woman from the previous night. She compliments the Going Merry. Vivi instantly recognizes the woman as the Vice President of Baroque works and female partner of Mr. 0 himself: Miss All Sunday. She says she ran into Mr. 8 (Igaram) just a bit ago, implying she was the one that blew up his ship. Luffy just wants to know why she is on their ship and who is she. Luffy then asks if she is bad. Miss All Sunday says she allowed Vivi to follow her and find out who Mr. 0 was, intrigued by a young girl trying to save her kingdom, but calling it ridiculous. Zoro and Nami draw their weapons, while Usopp and Sanji aim weapons at her, Usopp with his slingshot and Sanji with a pistol. Usopp notes it is out-of-character for Sanji to threaten a woman, but Sanji explains he sees her as a threat to Vivi. Miss All Sunday nonchalantly tells them not to point dangerous things at her, and suddenly they get disarmed. They realize she is a Devil Fruit user of some sort. Sanji also, after seeing how beautiful Miss All Sunday looks, predictably falls for her.
Miss All Sunday says she has no orders, so she has no reason to deal with them right now. She also reveals she has heard of Luffy as she sneaks his straw hat off with her power. She then reveals that Nami's Log Pose is pointing to Little Garden, home to one of the bases of Baroque Works. She tosses Luffy back his hat, and gives Vivi an Eternal Pose that points to Nanimonai Island, an uninhabited island near Arabasta. It will bypass all of their bases and supposedly allow Vivi to get safely home. Although Vivi thinks about it, Luffy crushes the Eternal Pose without a second thought. He tells Miss All Sunday he will not allow an outsider to determine his crew's course. Luffy also says he hates her because she exploded Igaram's ship. She responds by saying she likes Luffy's spirit, and that they should meet again someday if they make it through Baroque Works. She then departs, riding a large sea turtle. Vivi collapses, frustrated by Miss All Sunday's ambiguous nature. The others clue Usopp and Sanji in on what is going on as they continue their journey.
Elsewhere, Miss All Sunday wonders how the Straw Hats will fare when they get to Little Garden. A quick view of an island foreshadows with a jungle, a tiger and an enormous footprint relative to the tiger and the jungle.","Mr. 5, Miss Valentine, Zoro, Luffy, Karoo, Nefertari Vivi, Nami, Igaram, Mr. 13, Miss Friday, Usopp, Sanji, Miss All Sunday, Banchi",
Episode 68,"Try Hard, Koby! Diary of Koby-Meppo's Marine Struggles",13-May-01,"Luffy suddenly remembers about Koby and the scene goes to Helmeppo and Koby's hardships. The Marines are about to hand over Morgan to Vice Admiral Garp, but he escapes because of the two of them. Instead of being dismissed, Koby and Helmeppo go with Garp and he takes them to the Marine Headquarters in the Grand Line.","The Going Merry suddenly stops because the wind ceases to propel its sail. Vivi comments that time is running as they speak. Luffy interrupts Nami to exclaim it is time to fish and Karoo seems to like the idea. Sanji asks if anyone has seen the bait and Luffy responds he ate the stuff in there while pointing at the bucket with his eyes. Sanji points they were bugs while Luffy grabs the last one with only two of his fingers. While he has the bug halfway in his mouth, he says they taste good. Sanji adds that they cannot fish now since he ate the bait. Luffy brings out an object and says they can use it for bait, but Sanji replies that you cannot catch anything with that. Luffy points at Karoo and asks what about him, Sanji answers that it sounds okay. Luffy and Sanji start chasing Karoo around the mast while Nami and Vivi watch. Suddenly, they step on Zoro's forehead while he is asleep. Zoro consequently gets mad. Nami gets angry and Sanji comments that she is lovely when she gets angry. Nami remembers all the big names Luffy has beaten because Vivi thinks it is strange that he has a 30,000,000 bounty. Nami mentions that Luffy defeated Arlong, Pirate Fleet Commodore Don Krieg, and Captain Kuro. Zoro then adds that she forgot someone and Nami speaks the name of Axe-Hand Morgan. Upon mentioning his name, Luffy remembers about Koby and the sail catches wind. Then, Luffy states (after Nami asks) that ""he"" is his friend. The scene goes to a town with 3 Marine ships and Koby commandeering them. Then he starts telling Luffy that he has achieved his dream of becoming a Sub-Lieutenant. Suddenly, a gigantic watery Morgan emerges from the ocean and is about to chop Koby with his axe when another gigantic Luffy stops Morgan's arm. Luffy throws the giant Morgan and the view starts to shine with glitter. Then Koby faints and the scene goes to reality where Koby fells above Helmeppo (who is sleeping below him) and wakes him up.
Helmeppo gets mad and everybody that was asleep get angry because they were so noisy. Koby is a chore boy along with Helmeppo. A Marine soldier tells them that they enlisted without any qualifications resulting in them being chore boys. Ironically, Koby is still enthusiastic in doing whatever he can while Helmeppo gets mad at Koby for volunteering to more jobs and slacking at doing the chores. They go outside to clean windows and Helmeppo as usual is slacking again remembering his old days when Morgan was still a captain. It is clearly seen in the flashback that Helmeppo greatly depended on Morgan's terror because when he spilled his own cocoa, he scolded the soldiers and made reminded them of his father. He then thought that him being a chore boy was Luffy's fault as he stripped his dad's position. Koby told Helmeppo that blaming someone will not change anything even your fate. He told Helmeppo that that is a sign of being weak also emphasizing his reliance to his dad. When Koby told Helmeppo his dream about being a Marine officer, Helmeppo disbelieved telling him that is impossible but Koby said he will still do it when he saw how Luffy lived his life and risk his life accomplishing it. They fought on the roof about the probability of their dreams and their cooperation and some Marine soldiers gathered around the building. They suddenly fell and landed on crates and a cannon beside the crates turned around and shot its cannonball hitting a building destroying it. As punishment, they will not get any money for 50 years and they went to eat where Rika and her mom's store. They say that they escaped from them. Rika brings out a newspaper telling Luffy escaping from Smoker and from Loguetown and Koby discovers that he has reached the Grand Line.
In ship, Marine soldiers are guarding Morgan as he is going to a trial. Helmeppo and Koby are on the ship and upon seeing him, both of them get scared. The captain tells them that their mission is to escort him to give him to Vice Admiral Garp's custody so he will go for a court trial. Helmeppo and Koby are cleaning swords and cannonballs and Helmeppo tells Koby that he respected his father. Helmeppo says he wants to be like his father, but he knows he went too far, abusing his position. Helmeppo starts crying and wonders why he is crying. He asks Koby if his dad will be executed leaving Koby unable to answer. Garp's ship finally arrives and Helmeppo and Koby go out to see him. Garp is wearing his dog hat. When they give Morgan to Garp's custody, Garp briefly falls asleep. The captain shouts at him but he shouts back telling him he can hear him. He says he has not slept for 5 days and that he has reached a new record of doughnuts, having eaten 842 without stopping. Garp falls asleep again but Morgan slashes him and he breaks his chains, getting Helmeppo as a hostage. He says that he does not need a son and that he just wants freedom. Morgan sails with a small boat still holding Helmeppo and the soldiers are prepared to fire a cannon. Koby stands in front of the cannon and stops them from shooting. He tells them his friend is in the boat. He swims in order to reach the small boat and Garp wakes up as if nothing has happened. He yawns stretching his arms. He puts down his hand smashing the cannon and tells them that the commotion wake him up. When someone tells him they thought he was killed, Garp understands that someone (not him) was killed and he must have missed it while sleeping. He asks where the victim is, and upon realization, he looks at his slashed chest and jokingly tells them it was him. Morgan commands Helmeppo to turn dues west and Helmeppo refuses as he cannot take it anymore. Helmeppo says he will arrest Morgan, but Morgan punches him and asks if he knows who he is talking to. He asks what can he do alone and Koby climbs up the ship, letting him know he is not alone. Koby tells Morgan to come along quietly as he will ""arrest"" Morgan too.
Garp looks at them through binoculars while eating a doughnut. The boys are easily defeated. As they are fighting Morgan, Morgan grabs Koby and gets ready to hit him. As he is about to hit him, he throws the two away instead, as they are not worth killing. Helmeppo says he will let Morgan escape today, but someday, they will cross paths again and he will surely capture him on that day. When they get back to the ship, the Marine soldiers apologize because they had let the criminal escape and it was due to their negligence of not stopping Koby. The captain says they will dismiss the two of them because of their actions. Garp says he has no choice but to tell them to go with him to Marine Headquarters and tells them if they do not like it, they can run away. With that, Koby and Helmeppo sail with Garp and now headed to where Luffy is, the Grand Line.","Nami, Nefertari Vivi, Monkey D.

He invites Koby and Helmeppo to join in Marine Headquarters. Koby and Helmeppo decide to train for their dream, which is inspired by their friend Luffy. Koby and Helmeppo train harder in order to become stronger. Garp comes to know about Koby being friends with the captain of the Straw Hats. He inquires about their friendship with a pirate. Garp tells them to prove their strength. Koby and Helmeppo fight Garp, but are not able to defeat him. Garp says that he was testing their mental power. He says to Koby and Helmeppo that they are going to be trained under his supervision.","The episode starts and Usopp is fantasizing and talking to himself about how everyone in Little Garden will welcome him. Then Zoro (who is at the lowest deck) grabs an apple from a barrel full of them, takes a bite of it and asks Usopp if he is an idiot. Usopp responds to Zoro by yelling that he could hear what Zoro just said while kicking the bottom part of wooden where he is seated. Nami yells at both of them to keep quiet and apologizes to Vivi. Vivi keeps explaining to Nami why there are no islands, but it is easy to hit reefs due to elevated corals (presumably on the Grand Line). While they are speaking the scene goes to Sanji who is cooking, and suddenly, Usopp shows up through the window on the kitchen and smiles (probably due to Sanji's food). Sanji makes the girls know that the desert is ready and when he is serving it Usopp shows in between Nami and Vivi. Sanji, in a mad way, lets Usopp know that his food is ""over there"". Later, Sanji asks the girls where Luffy is and Nami replies she asked Luffy to draw water for her because she wants to take a shower. She then says Luffy must be at the water-drawing machine. Sanji comments no wonder he has been quiet all that time. Immediately after, a loud noise comes from a room and Luffy having come out of it. Luffy then adds that he was just using the machine when it suddenly broke and Nami punches him in the head. After that, everyone except Usopp is seated around a table and while Nami is reading the newspaper, Luffy sees an image where Koby appears and asks Nami to tell him what does the article says.
Koby and Helmeppo are amused by the amount of work the marines seem to do in the Marine Headquarters. Then, both of them are hiding in an alley and Helmeppo talks about giving up because the work there seems so hard for him to keep up with. Koby tries to encourage him to persevere because Helmeppo said to his father that he will surpass him no matter what. When he talks about why they should not run away, Vice Admiral Garp shows up behind them. Suddenly, they both are afraid of what Garp will do to them. Koby tries to justify his saying by clarifying him and Helmeppo will do anything that Garp orders, and that they are prepared to die.
The scene goes then to the ""Sea food"" restaurant where Rika and Ririka are talking to the marines in charge of Shells Town. Rika lifts up a bank, bring it close to a marine (presumably the one in charge) and starts hitting him in the head with his two fists. She complains about how she would have liked to spent more time with them. She also adds that she was learning to cook in order to prepare them a tasty lunch sometime. You can see her face crying before you can watch two sprouts in flowerpots (presumably as an analogy with how much room for growth Koby and Helmeppo have, since they have joined the Marine HQ).
Then, the scene goes to Koby and Helmeppo washing the floor as Helmeppo complains about how doing chores will make him a marine. It is also notable that Garp is watching over them, so they wash faster. As when the night has set, you hear Koby and Helmeppo's chat. Helmeppo comments how Vice-Admiral Garp was called ""Garp the Fist"" and was quite feared by everyone. He then talks about how if he wants to become stronger, faster, he has to build his body over the nights. Koby disagrees with this idea, since it is likely to overwork the body because of the need to sleep. Helmeppo does not seem to listen and since he is already going downstairs, Koby joins him too. It looks like they have been training hard for a long time. One day they are talking about Luffy and Garp listens to them. Garp takes them to beach to test their mentality and they pass his test. Garp gives them a special training and they appear to be following it. The scene goes back to the Straw Hat Pirates and everybody is asleep except for Nami. Nami watches Vivi as she sleeps and stores the newspaper in a drawer. Luffy gives the order to set sail to Little Garden while asleep and the boys of the crew agree with him, also while asleep.","Usopp, Karoo, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Nefertari Vivi, Sanji, Monkey D.

Returning to the crew, they remember what Miss All Sunday said about the island, stating that they will all be dead before they reach Arabasta. The crew gets restless as they see more of the island, but keeps on going due to lack of food and materials. As they enter the island, Sanji gets attacked by a gigantic bird signalling that this island is not normal at all. To reassure that notion, a huge tiger prowls beside the boat and then keels over with blood.

So Luffy, Vivi and Karoo depart after Sanji has made a pirate lunch for the three of them. Zoro decides to take a walk, and Sanji asks him to get some edible-looking animals to bring back. Zoro makes a smart remark and challenges Sanji to see if he can get a bigger animal than him. Sanji furious with this, embarks onto the island to get more kilos than Zoro, and Zoro responds by saying they will compete for tons.
Creeped out by the noises, Nami realizes that she remembers something about Little Island in a book and starts searching for it. Luffy and Vivi find a shellfish that looks like a squid, just as the sound of giant footsteps are coming from behind. As the time being, Sanji nearly gets eaten by a T. rex. Zoro encounters a Triceratops and wonders if it is edible. Luffy and Vivi also find a dinosaur, but this one is a Brachiosaurus.

The reindeer tries to deny her claims but Kureha assures him of her claims and tells him that there is no medicine that can work for all diseases and that is why doctors exist and being kind is not enough to save people. Kureha further explains that Chopper needs medical skills and the training to use them. Realizing what he did, Chopper starts crying hysterically as a saddened Kureha calls him a poor fool.
Hiriluk arrives in town and throws two bombs at the guards. He then orders a guard to take him to the top of the mountain where the castle is.

Inside the castle, Nami gets a coat and prepares to escape while Kureha is occupied, wanting to get back on the sea and get Vivi back to Arabasta. She walks out of the room only to catch sight of Wapol, who immediately suspects she is one of the Straw Hats. He chases her along the ledge but gets stuck in a stairway. He uses Baku Baku Factory: Slim-up Wapol to ""eat himself"" and become slim. However, the moment he tackles Nami to consume her, he gets a kick to the face from Luffy. Nami conks Luffy over the head for damaging her jacket as it cost her 28,800 after bargaining. She tells him that now he has to pay her 100,000 for it.
Wapol reaches the doorway to the castle armory, which only he has a key for. His plan is to eat all the weapons with Baku Baku Factory to become a human weapon, but when he reaches for his key, he finds it is gone and runs up the column stairway with Luffy chasing him. Nami is disappointed as she swiped that key hoping it opened a treasury. Sanji, still debilitated by his re-injured back, crawls back to Nami, realizing she is not injured. Wapol is determined to retake his kingdom and get his revenge. He gets to the top dome of the castle and uncovers his ultimate weapon: the Royal Drum Crown Seven-Shot Bliking Cannon. Luffy arrives and Wapol tries to fire the cannon at him. It makes some noises, but shoots nothing. Wapol tries the trigger lever several times, but it appears the cannon is empty. All that comes out are snowbirds that were nesting inside.
As Chopper waits outside for the battle's final outcome, villagers have assembled at the base of the Drum Ropeway, which is also Dr. Kureha's house. A gondola is transporting some soldiers along with Zoro, Usopp, Vivi, and Dalton. Usopp wonders if Dalton should have come at all since he is still recovering from his injuries and hypothermia, but he is determined to see Wapol defeated and his kingdom destroyed. Back at the castle, Luffy grabs Wapol, saying the battle is over and what he is does not matter, since he is a pirate. Wapol says assaulting him is a crime against the World Government, which Drum Kingdom is a part of. He opens his mouth wide to eat Luffy, but Luffy's rubber fingers stretch around it. Wapol turns his tongue into Bero Cannon to shoot Luffy.
On the Drum Ropeway, Dalton recalls how Wapol captured most of Drum's doctors, and his ministers claimed that government did not need to be good to its people. Dr. Hiriluk changed that opinion for him. He reveals he has dynamite, which he will use to destroy the castle once they get there. Dr. Kureha asks Chopper if he is worried about Luffy. Chopper responds that he does not need to be, since Luffy is a pirate. Sure enough, Luffy is unharmed by Wapol's cannon and uses Gomu Gomu no Bow Gun to fire Wapol upward, getting him stuck in the top of the dome. He sees Hiriluk's flag on another spire of the castle where Luffy replanted it after he tried to shoot it down. Kureha tells Chopper that the end of the Drum Kingdom has finally come.
As Chopper remembers Dr. Hiriluk, Luffy tells Wapol not to mess with the flag if he is not prepared to suffer the consequences. Ignoring pleas from Wapol, including an offer to make him the vice-king, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Bazooka to launch Wapol far away from the island. The Drum Ropeway gondola arrives at the castle. Luffy pounces Zoro and Usopp from the top of the castle, at first thinking Zoro was one of Wapol's men because he was wearing one of their coats. He then tells Vivi that Nami and Sanji are fine. As Dalton makes his way off the gondola, Luffy says he was ""beating up the king"" and Dalton realizes Wapol has been defeated. He also adds that ""the reindeer"" beat up Wapol's minions. Dalton notices Chopper, who is ""hiding"" behind a tree, and remembers him from the ambush on Dr. Hiriluk. Realizing Chopper has always been fighting for them, he bows to the reindeer, thanking him and vowing that the kingdom will be reborn.
The other villagers arrive and identify Chopper as a monster. Dalton tries to stop their fear as Usopp also cries out that he is a monster. Luffy tells him not to call Chopper a monster as he is their new crewmate. Chopper runs off and Luffy gives chase.","Nami, Wapol, Monkey D.

Kureha was skeptical, but Hiriluk was certain the vision would save his people, just as he was convinced they had saved him.
In the present, Chopper is sitting atop Drum Castle following the end of the Luffy's fight with Wapol, contemplating his time with Doctor, and thinking of his Jolly Roger. He also remembers how Hiriluk told him once that he should go out to sea someday, so he can see how small his problems really are. He is soon found by Luffy, who resumes chasing Chopper to make him part of the crew.
Dr. Kureha rounds up the wounded, including Dalton, Sanji and Nami, and returns them to a room. She deals roughly with Sanji's back, which he reinjured in the battle. She then asks Dalton for the key to the castle's armory. Dalton says that Wapol would have had the key, and it likely went flying along with him. Nami speaks up, eager to negotiate terms of payment. She asks Kureha to waive the medical fees for the crew and discharge her and Sanji immediately. Kureha demands all the treasure and supplies on the Going Merry as payment and that they remain for two more days to fully heal. Nami then reveals the key to the armory, which she swiped from Wapol during their encounter. Kureha takes the key and agrees to waive payment. Although she says they have to remain in the castle, she tells Nami she has a coat in her room and that there are no guards present. She also says Sanji's treatment is complete, permitting her to leave with him if she so chooses.
Chopper finally returns to the roof, thinking he gave Luffy the slip. He thinks it is best not to join the pirates. He then hears Luffy call out to him from below. Zoro and Usopp are convinced that Chopper does not want to go, but Chopper actually does. Chopper finally jumps down and confronts Luffy as Nami and Vivi drag Sanji out from the castle. Chopper tries to explain that he can never be on Luffy's crew because he is a reindeer, blue-nosed, and a monster, even though he really wants to be a pirate. As he invites Luffy to return some time, Luffy cries out for Chopper to shut up and come with him anyway. Chopper is moved to tears, finally having friends who do not care that he is different. The others smile, except Sanji, who is still unconscious, and Zoro, who says that yelling ""shut up"" is not the way to make friends.
The Straw Hats give Chopper some time to say goodbye to Kureha while Usopp and Luffy get the Drum Ropeway ready. Kureha is in the armory, supervising the soldiers moving the cannons outside. She returns to the room, finding only Dalton is there, who confirms that the others have left. Chopper finds her there, and tells her that he is leaving to become the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. She berates him, accusing him of having no gratitude for her training. Chopper says he is every bit a man as a reindeer, but Kureha starts to throw her ornamental arms at him, saying he will only leave if he passes through her. Chopper runs away, with Kureha chasing him through the castle.
As they run, Nami wonders about the commotion growing in the castle. Chopper goes to Walk Point and hitches into Kureha's sleigh. Kureha yells to him as he pulls out of the castle that he is following a crazy fantasy just like Hiriluk. Chopper thinks she is wrong because Hiriluk completed his research before he died. He calls out to the Straw Hats to get into the sleigh, arriving right when Usopp finishes preparing the ropeway. The nearby villagers look into the sky finding an apparent flying reindeer. In reality, Chopper is running down the ropeway with Kureha's sleigh and the Straw Hats towing Luffy behind. Chopper contemplates happier times during his medical training as he runs away. Sanji comes to as they get to ground and run for the shoreline. Kureha watches from the top of the ropeway, and Dalton joins her. She says that her pet simply ran away and that she simply does not like long goodbyes. She tells Dalton to join her by the assembled cannons, so she can give Chopper and the Straw Hats a proper send-off.
Chopper wonders if Hiriluk really completed his research, or if he was just lying to make Chopper feel better at the end of his life. A flashback shows Hiriluk explaining his research to Kureha. The people outside the Drum Castle fire the cannons, leaving the villagers to wonder if the battle is resuming. Chopper stops and watches as something incredible happens. Hiriluk explained that the dust he created would color the snow, turning it into a pink color. Fired above the mountain, it makes the mountain look like a gigantic sakura tree, with the snow looking like falling petals. Kureha still does not understand what Hiriluk was thinking. Upon seeing the fruition of his father figure's work, Chopper bursts into tears. The people in the kingdom are moved as well and Kureha bids Chopper one last farewell.","Hiriluk (flashback), Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 91,"Farewell, Drum Island! I'm Going Out to Sea!",9-Dec-01,"Chopper joins the Straw Hats as they continue their journey to Arabasta. They get him caught up on some of the things they have faced on their journey thus far. In the meantime, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei decides to head for Arabasta after failing to locate Mr. 3 on Little Garden.","As they sail away from Drum Island, the Straw Hats gaze with wonder at the sakura effect over the island. Usopp wonders why Chopper looks so distant, sitting on a railing as if lost in thought. The others are not worrying about that. Sanji says his first trip as a ""man"" is a rite of passage. His thoughts are on Hiriluk and Kureha. It does not take long before the horseplay begins, with Luffy entertaining the others with his ""nose chopsticks"" trick. Soon, the boys try to get Chopper in on the fun, with Usopp offering him a drink, Sanji inviting him to sing with them, and Luffy offering him the nose chopsticks. He crawls away, still feeling a bit overwhelmed by the attention. Nami gets Chopper's attention, and tells him that his new friends can get a little out of hand occasionally. Chopper starts to warm up to the thought of actually belonging to a group of friends.
Vivi is doting over Karoo, who she found frozen in a river. Zoro jokes by saying that he probably fell. Chopper asks Karoo about it himself, and finds out that he jumped in after Zoro, thinking he was in trouble. After hearing this, Nami hits Zoro. Chopper reveals he can talk to animals at this point. Nami is amazed at this skill in addition to his medical skills. The others ask what she means by medical skills, and find out he was trained by Kureha to be a doctor. Luffy just thought they were getting a cool talking reindeer with seven transformations. Sanji just thought Chopper was emergency food.
At this point, Chopper remembers his medical bag, thinking he left it at Drum Island. Nami then holds up his medical bag, telling him it was inside the sleigh. Chopper does not remember packing it, and realizes that Kureha must have put it in there, anticipating his departure. Nami gets annoyed as the boys resume their revelry. She then finds Chopper trying out the nose chopsticks. As things get crazy, Usopp proposes a toast for their new crewmate. Chopper then says that he has never had this much fun before.
Back on Drum Island, Kureha and Dalton continue to talk. Kureha says the real miracle of Hiriluk's cherry blossoms was sending Chopper out on his own. Dalton begins talking about his plans now that Wapol is gone. He had wanted to leave to atone for his past working along Wapol, but he has since determined that he can atone better by helping to reform the kingdom. Kureha thinks he has what it takes to lead the new country.
Dalton then remembers an incident 10 years before, involving Wapol at a Levely. He remembers being impressed of Vivi's father and the king of Arabasta, Nefertari Cobra. The subject is ""Revolutionist"" Dragon and Wapol is highly disinterested in the proceedings. King Cobra calls him out for his dismissive attitude and Wapol gets mad. Afterward, Wapol gets his revenge by hitting Cobra's daughter and pretending it was some sort of accident. She got up, smiled, and forgave Wapol for the accident in public. Not long after, Dalton caught sight of her crying with Igaram over the pain. He greatly respected the child for the dignity she carried herself with.
The Isshi-20 who were previously commissioned by Wapol pledge their allegiance to Dalton, begging him to allow them to help the country. Someone runs up and hands Dalton Luffy's wanted poster. He says that a week before, a young man entered Robelle. He noted that, oddly, it did not snow that day. The young man was looking for Blackbeard, but missed him. He then presented the man a wanted poster, saying he was looking for a guy wearing a straw hat. He was asked that, if Luffy showed up, to tell him to look for Ace in Arabasta in the next ten days. The man is then run off when it is found he skipped out on a bill at a nearby restaurant. Recognizing the name on the wanted poster, Kureha mentions that the Will of D. is still alive, revealing that the previous Pirate King's name was actually Gol D. Roger.
The next day, Chopper is sitting by the bow of the Going Merry with Luffy, wondering at the vastness of the ocean. Suddenly, a giant bird flies over, and Luffy calls out to it. The bird starts to fly toward the boat head-on and swoops just above the bow, grabbing Luffy. Chopper freaks out, thinking Luffy has been eaten. Zoro tells Chopper to calm down, saying that he should not worry about Luffy unless he actually calls for help. Sure enough, Luffy grabs the giant bird's beak and uses Gomu Gomu no Propeller to bring it down. While the other guys are mad that he interrupted a card game, he presents the bird as fresh meat for Sanji to deal with. Chopper thinks the adventure was incredible. Nami then comes back, telling the guys they will be at Arabasta soon.
The Straw Hats get Chopper caught up on their current mission: returning Vivi to Arabasta so they can prevent a coup by Crocodile, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Crocodile is abusing his authority as a World Government privateer with his Baroque Works crime syndicate to undermine the kingdom. Vivi describes the group's structure, with the five Officer Agent pairs under Crocodile, the eight Frontier Agent groups below them, and the Billions and Millions subordinates throughout, a total force of around 2,000 men. The crew reasons that, if Crocodile's goal is indeed to seize control of Arabasta, then he must be mustering the full strength of Baroque Works to the area to assist in his coup. Luffy seems eager just to beat up Crocodile.
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei has arrived at Little Garden and is punishing his navigator. They had been tasked with assassinating Mr. 3, but somehow missed him. They head to Arabasta to resume their mission. Meanwhile, back at Baroque Works' headquarters, Crocodile and his Baroque Works assistant, Miss All Sunday, discuss the growing threat of pirate attacks on Arabasta.

While waiting for his ship to come retrieve him, the Officer Agent (unaware he's in the company of enemies) shows off his Devil Fruit powers. As the Going Merry approaches the coast of Arabasta, Zoro devises a plan to counteract Mr. 2's disguising ability.","Puppu's ship is docked in the coast of Nanohana and his Jolly Roger is waving. His pirates are looting the place while causing a fuss. Pell, Chaka and some men are riding horses, heading to Nanohana. Suddenly, Crocodile appears on top of a building and a woman spots him. He catches the attention of everyone in the place and a lot of people start to call out his name, including Puppu, who recognizes him as one of the Shichibukai. Crocodile says he just came to get the head of Puppu, but the pirates tell him to not underestimate them. Puppu tells him that he sold himself to authority and that he is the World Government's dog. As he gets down from the building, Crocodile says that anyone who does not wish to die should lay on the ground. When Crocodile lands on the ground, Puppu and his crew stab him, however, they are unable withdraw their swords. Crocodile raises his arm, and an upside-down twister starts to form. After the twister dissipates, the pirates are seen dead, covered in sand and dehydrated. The soldiers arrive when Crocodile is already leaving.
In the Alubarna Palace, Chaka is presenting the information of the Puppu pirates' invasion to Nefertari Cobra.
Meanwhile, the Going Merry goes through water vapor caused by an underwater volcano. The Straw Hats fish out and save Mr. 2 from drowning whilst inside the fog. While waiting for his ship, Mr. 2 demonstrates his Mane Mane no Mi devil fruit ability of being able to clone anyone whose face he touches with his right hand. He is able to clone everyone except for Sanji who was in the kitchen searching the storage area for something to cook for his hungry crewmates. Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper are fascinated with his power obtained through the devil fruit he ate. During this demonstration, Vivi notices that Mr. 2 has cloned her father, Cobra. Sometime later, the ship of Mr. 2 arrives to rescue him, and everyone is surprised to learn that he is actually an officer agent of Baroque Works. Since Mr. 2 was able to clone them, they wrap bandages around their arms so they cannot confuse any of them if Mr. 2 decides to disguise as one of them.","Puppu, Crocodile, Pell, Chaka, Nefertari Cobra, Nami, Nefertari Vivi, Sanji, Monkey D.

The crew members disguise themselves while Luffy learns about Dance Powder.,"As the Straw Hats arrive at Arabasta, Nami expects everyone to be on their best behavior. However, Luffy immediately runs off to get food, separating from his crew. The crew then notices that Mr. 3's ship is docked nearby and Vivi remembers that the ship moves by the means of Mr. 3's Doru Doru no Mi. Vivi says that she and Karoo cannot go onto the streets since most of the citizens would immediately recognize her, so Usopp comes up with an idea to walk through the streets while hiding under a blanket. After walking through the streets being concealed under a blanket, they manage to get to a safe place. Vivi says that she plans on going to Yuba where the rebel's base is but the only way for them to travel is crossing the desert so they decided to stock up on supplies. Sanji and Chopper are the only ones who Mr. 3 has not seen so they go off to buy the supplies.
In the middle of a desert, Luffy finds himself lost but then sees smoke in the distance and thinks that the smoke is coming from a restaurant. Sanji and Chopper are buying the supplies they need but Chopper notices a strange smell which makes him feel uncomfortable and Sanji tells him that it is called perfume. Sanji is distracted by the beautiful women in Arabasta and Chopper cannot bear the aroma, so Sanji tells him that he would take care of the shopping and runs off, yelling for the women. Chopper is exhausted by the heat so he decides to rest in a truck with enough shade to cool down. He decides to take a nap inside until Sanji returns, but after he falls asleep, the truck starts to travel with Chopper inside.
Luffy stands in front of the building that had smoke coming out, but much to his disappointment, he thinks it does not look anything like a restaurant. Luffy sees a pile of bags filled with green powder and comments that it tastes awful after trying a little. He then puts all the bags into the incinerator thinking it must be poison. When the bags are being burnt, Luffy notices the smoke coming out of the chimney turning into a faded green color and then dark clouds start to appear. Rain starts falling from the clouds and a man inside the building realizes the rain and rushes outside. The man starts getting upset since the powder was his great ambition. Luffy apologizes and says that he could simply buy it again but the man says that it is very difficult to get and accidentally reveals that the sale is prohibited, making Luffy realize that the old man is a criminal.
When Chopper wakes up, he is confused and panics because the truck is moving. After that, the truck stops as it arrives to where Koza is. Inside a room, a man coming to Koza has a short talk and Koza says that he and the rebel army will change Arabasta. While Chopper is nervous, Matsuge helps Chopper escape. Chopper asks the camel why he helped him escape and it replies by saying that it makes him look cool. Chopper thinks that the camel is weird but fun. Chopper then goes back to Nanohana by following the aroma of perfume.
Luffy is sitting along with Kamonegi, whose face is swollen. Luffy asks the man what the powder was for and he replies that the green powder is called Dance Powder, also known as Rain-Calling Powder. It goes through a complicated process to artificially make rainfall. He then goes on saying that Arabasta has fought against drought since ancient times, but they were not able to use Dance Powder since it is prohibited by the World Government and that the rebellion is one of the outcomes of the drought.
Sanji and Chopper come back from shopping and they now plan on going to Yuba. Vivi says that this will be a scorching, hot journey and they put all their strengths into the journey. However, they suddenly remember that Luffy is missing.","Nefertari Vivi, Karoo, Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Sanji, Monkey D. Luffy, Tony Tony Chopper, Matsuge, Kamonegi, Koza",Doru Doru no Mi

Ace appears, and is revealed to be Luffy's older brother.","In Nanohana, a young man previously shown in Drum Kingdom is shown walking the town. A salesman approaches him claiming to have a magical golden apple, but he refuses to buy it. Chopper and Usopp overhear the offer, but Nami and Zoro stop them from being conned after Zoro finds an associate painting them. Zoro notices a man asking if people in the town had seen Luffy, using his wanted poster. He is directed to Spice Bean where the owner knows many of the townspeople.
The present Straw Hats wonder why he is looking for Luffy. Zoro notices the tattoo on the man's back, and knows he is not a bounty hunter. He then sees Tashigi elsewhere in the town, dressing a shopkeeper down for overpricing swords, and hides. Smoker appears, carrying several captured small-time pirates. He is sure Luffy will show up in Arabasta, and has Tashigi take the defeated pirates to the Royal Army. Zoro wonders where Luffy ran off to. He is wandering across the desert, and starts running when he sees a town nearby, hunger driving him to find food.
At the Spice Bean restaurant, patrons are gathered around the young man seen earlier, who is face-first in a plate of food. They believe he has dropped dead mid-eating, and suspect he was bitten by a venomous insect. Suddenly, he wakes up, wipes his face off, and resumes eating. He tells everyone he just fell asleep. Shortly after, he falls asleep again. After waking up, the man asks Yoshimoto if he has seen Luffy.
They are interrupted by Smoker, who noticed the earlier commotion. He identifies the young man as the Second Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Portgas D. Ace, startling those present. When asked why he is here, Ace says he is looking for his brother. Luffy is running through Nanohana, tracing the scent of food. Smoker says he is not here for Ace, but will go ahead and try to capture him. Suddenly, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Rocket to launch himself towards Spice Bean. He rams Smoker and Ace through the restaurant's rear wall and the walls of several adjacent buildings, then demands the restaurant owner make him food.
While Luffy is chowing down, Ace and Smoker are on their way back to the restaurant. Ace apologizes to a family for disturbing their meal. Smoker identifies Luffy, though it takes a second for Luffy to remember him from their encounter at Loguetown. He stacks all the remaining food in his mouth, and runs, with Smoker chasing him. The owner notes that neither Ace nor Luffy paid for their meals. Luffy knows he cannot beat Smoker, so he goes looking for his crew. Smoker sees Tashigi and orders her to look for the Straw Hats as he pursues Luffy. As she runs, knowing that Luffy is in town, she thinks it is likely for Zoro to be there as well.
Smoker asks Luffy why he is in Arabasta, to which he responds he came to beat up Crocodile. Smoker asks him how they are connected but Luffy disappears. On the other side of town, Nami, Zoro, Chopper and Usopp catch back up with Sanji, Vivi and Karoo, and tell them the Marine is present. They hear a commotion, and Luffy soon runs to them, with Smoker on his trail. Smoker is intercepted by Ace, who uses Kagero to halt his attack, White Blow.
Luffy recognizes Ace, and is surprised he is a Devil Fruit user now. Ace tells him he ate the Mera Mera no Mi. He then tells Luffy to run, and says he will hold Smoker off. Smoker asks why Ace is helping the Straw Hats and he says a big brother has to help his little brother.

A bifurcation is in their way and Nami tells everyone to follow her, but Luffy goes the other way, as he was watching his brother fight. The Straw Hats arrive at the ship and carry all the supplies, only to notice that Luffy is missing. Luffy is sitting on the barrel he was carrying in an alley, but he does not know where his crew went. Ace greets him from the top of a house in the alley and then comes down. They start arm wrestling on top of the barrel Luffy was sitting on, but after struggling, the barrel breaks and the water inside it scatters. They both agree that they are equally strong. Ace invites Luffy and his crew to join the Whitebeard Pirates, but Luffy declines.
On Smoker's ship, Mr. 11 is left alone, tied to the mast. Some Billions get on the deck and Mr. 11 asks them to untie him. They explain that as Billions, they are candidates to be promoted to Officer Agents. Mr. 11 asks them to untie him again, but they shoot him. The Billions get off the ship and someone informs them that Fire Fist Ace is in the town. One of them then comments that if they take down Ace, they will surely be promoted to Officer Agents.
Luffy and Ace start searching for Luffy's crew, but as they walk, Billions start to surround them without being noticed. After they are gathered, everyone comes out. Luffy and Ace do not care what they say and keep walking but the Billions start a fight. After Luffy sends the leader flying with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, one of the Billions tells his comrades not to be scared by that, and everyone keeps chasing them again.

Ace reaches the ship in his boat, but then they spot five Billions ships coming towards them. Ace tells Luffy that he can handle them, gets in his boat, and starts propelling it with the help of his flames. He then jumps over a ship and when he lands, he launches a Hiken, destroying the five ships consecutively.
Smoker is talking to Tashigi and asks what Nefertari Vivi was doing with the Straw Hats. Tashigi proposes that perhaps she was a hostage to a major scheme, but Smoker does not think so. He thinks that is unlikely since she was getting along with the group as if she was one of them. He says that something big is going to occur and that he may know where they are heading after Luffy told him he only wanted to beat Crocodile. Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper in the Going Merry are toasting for Ace joining the Straw Hats, but Ace tells them he is not joining them. After that, he explains that he is in search for Blackbeard after he killed one of his crewmates.

He says he has to pack lunches and Ace tells him that he can help, but Sanji declines because Ace is a guest.

Vivi asks Nami if they can stop, as she has an important task for Karoo. They are outside the ship on a shore and Vivi asks Karoo if he can deliver a letter for her father, even though he has to cross a desert by himself. In that letter, she has written all the schemes of Baroque Works. Karoo accepts and departs rapidly. On the deck of the ship, Ace suggests to Zoro that Crocodile might have a deeper goal than just usurping the throne.
Crocodile lights a cigar and talks to himself about his views on Arabasta, the kingdom of sand, when Miss All Sunday starts walking towards him. She then informs Crocodile that the Billions ships that were at the port town of Nanohana have been all wiped out by a single person, and that they are confirming the information just as they speak.

He also tells her that he always had charisma and befriends people around him. In the morning, Luffy founds an extremely poisonous scorpion, but mistakes it for a shrimp. When Vivi wakes up and sees Luffy holding the scorpion she yells to leave it alone since a sting is extremely poisonous.
They continue their journey and Luffy proposes to have lunch because he is hungry. Vivi tells him that they are only one tenth of their way and Luffy makes up a proverb for eating.

As they're leaving, Zoro questions the whereabouts of Luffy's brother, Ace. Luffy claims that Ace would eventually show up out of nowhere, and the crew begins their journey to the city of Ido.
Meanwhile, in Ido, a group of Camu's rebels are having a meal with the mayor, discussing the strength of their troops and telling how the rebel and royal army would soon have to clash. Suddenly, one of Camu's men rushes up to him exclaiming about the arrival of sand pirates. Camu's decision was to run and hide, to the others' surprise. As Camu begins to walk out, the lizard that Ace was accompanying shows up and behind them Ace is sitting at the table eating their food. The men call Ace a ""food thief"", and Ace goes on to beat the living crap out of them. Camu watches, petrified, and bows down to Ace in fear and begs for his help against the sand pirates. Ace agrees to do so, but on a condition.
While riding on the lizard to defeat the sand pirates, he runs into Luffy and his crew, saying how the rebels believed that they were sand pirates. Ace explains to Vivi how there are ""rebels"" in town, but are actually mere hoodlums. Vivi gets upset, and says how there is nothing wrong with villagers wanting to protect their village, even if it means posing as rebels. She brings up the idea of testing them to see if they are strong enough to carry the burden of protecting the village on their shoulders.
Camu and his men are seen hiding in barrels, questioning whether Ace had beat the sand pirates or not. As Camu begins to leave once again, all the villagers show up outside his door cheering him on for the oncoming fight against the sand pirates. The mayor walks up to them and wishes them the best against the sea pirates. Camu is confused, as he was sure they were sand pirates. The mayor then goes to show him the wanted poster of 30,000,000 on Luffy's head, and he becomes frightened. They begin to secretly devise a plan to outrun the pirates once they leave town, but as they open the gates, the Straw Hat Pirates surround them menacingly [ゴゴゴゴ]. The rebels stand their ground as the Straw Hats begin to attack. Camu and his men decide to stop being cowards and stand their ground. Vivi is satisfied with this and signals for the Straw hats to retreat. By the end of the episode, Luffy and his crew deem the ""rebels"" worthy of staying to protect the town.","Monkey D.

Episode 100,Rebel Warrior Koza! The Dream Sworn to Vivi!,10-Feb-02,"The Straw Hats, Vivi and Ace are still traveling through the desert. Vivi tells Nami about her childhood, her childhood affiliation and reveals the identity of the rebel leader.","The Straw Hats, Vivi and Ace are still traveling together on their way to the Yuba Oasis. Vivi intends to meet with the rebel army there. Luffy and Usopp, thirsty and tired, began struggling with each to get a drink of water from the skin bottle. Sanji decides to save his for Nami and Vivi, but Luffy tries to take his water bottle away from him. At that point, Luffy, Usopp and Sanji begin fighting over the water in the skin bottle. Nami asks Vivi to tell her more about the Rebel army and Vivi went to tell her of the events that occurred 11 years back.
A young Koza is seen before King Cobra complaining that his village is dried up and the king is doing nothing to help. The King in turn, told him that the weather is commanded by God and that he has no power over nature. Just then Toto arrived beseeching the king that he would accept the punishment for his rude son. Cobra promised to look after the village affected by the drought and told Toto to remain in Alubarna. Koza, still upset at the king, said the king does not understand the feelings of the people and fled his sight. Cobra then told Toto that Koza is a good child because he cares for the people and their feelings. Vivi, standing by the hallway saw Koza running down crying and called him a crybaby. Igaram is seen telling Cobra that the country's budget will not suffice to help the whole village affected by the draught and Cobra, comically hitting him on the head, told him to take money out of their personal wallets.
Just then, Vivi appeared before her father and told him she got into a fight but lost. Igaram was angry that Koza hit the princess and Toto was pleading to the king for him to commit suicide as a way of apology. Cobra told them to stay out of it for it is simply a children's quarrel. In the village, Vivi challenged Koza for the position of leader of the Sand-Sand Clan. After their fight, Koza announced Vivi as the new assistant leader of the Suna-Suna Clan. Igaram and Cobra were watching in hiding and Cobra commented that Vivi has made friends, which is important for the next ruler to have. Vivi, after joining the clan became close to Koza's family. Vivi was about to be kidnapped when the Sand-Sand Clan launched an offensive against the kidnappers to protect Vivi. Meanwhile, in the desert, a scorpion came out from the ground and was about to attack Luffy, making Zoro, Sanji, Chopper and Luffy all together beat the scorpion.
The Sand-Sand Clan continued to fight the kidnappers, when a third one appeared grabbing Vivi. Vivi bit him and ran towards the ruins. Igaram and Cobra appeared after the children have been defeated and inquired on what had happened. They were told, and they went after Vivi. At the ruins, the kidnappers were looking for Vivi and one found her. Koza came from behind and hit him with a club. The kidnapper and Koza went at each other but Koza defeated him by hitting him in the head but got cut by the kidnapper's sword near his left eye. Just then the other two arrived and when they were about to fight Koza, when Igaram and Cobra knocked them out. Pell and Chaka also defeated the rest of the kidnapping ring crew.
Vivi, upon Koza's recovery cried and told him not to give his life to save hers, after remembering their resolve to protect her. Cobra thanked Koza for his noble deed, although Koza said he did it for a friend. Cobra asked if Koza loved the country and he replied ""yes"" saying it is the country of his birth and Cobra commented that he also loves the country. Koza told Vivi about Toto accepting the position of a representative to build the Oasis of Yuba into a town, since it is the hub of Western Arabasta. Koza told her he was leaving with his father and would help build Yuba with his own two hands. Koza, upon leaving told Vivi to become a great princess.
In the present, Nami comments that Vivi's friend - Koza - seems like a good person and asked what that had to do with the Rebels. Vivi then revealed to Nami that Koza was the leader of the Rebel army.","Matsuge, Nefertari Vivi, Nami, Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp, Sanji, Portgas D.

Episode 101,Heat Haze Duel! Ace vs. Scorpion Man,17-Feb-02,"Ace is hunted by a bounty hunter named Scorpion and finds out that Blackbeard is not in Arabasta after all. He leaves the group to continue looking for him, leaving Luffy a mysterious piece of paper, explaining that it will help them meet again at the top.","The episode starts off showing the Arabasta desert. A man named Scorpion is shown sleeping on top of a large rock outlook with a bird that looks like an ostrich wearing a helmet called Popo. Food is scattered across the ground. Popo walks over to Scorpion and wakes him up. When Scorpion asks what's the matter. Popo points to rising smoke in the distance. Scorpion grabs his spyglass and points it to where the smoke is rising up. He sees the Straw Hats and Ace. Once Scorpion realizes who it is sweat covers his face and he gets excited. He has been waiting for the day that he finally tracked down Portgas D. Ace.
The Straw Hats and Ace are eating, Luffy and Usopp are asking for seconds. Sanji kicks them telling them to stop being greedy. After hearing this Luffy steals some from Zoro's plate. They all start fighting.
Vivi starts talking to Nami and asks why every meal turns into a fight. Nami responds by telling her to ignore it. They both admire Portgas D. Ace for eating quietly and cleaning his fork and plate. ""He sure is different,"" remarks Nami, comparing Ace to Luffy. Nami starts talking about how much Ace is worth, and that his bounty makes bounty hunters drool.
Switching back to Scorpion, he is loading a rocket launcher and starts aiming at Ace. He says, ""With this one shot, I'll settle everything."" He lights the fuse on his rocket. Popo sneezes on the fuse putting it out without Scorpion noticing.
Nami starts getting ready to set off traveling to Yuba. She tells the rest of the Straw Hats to start getting ready by cleaning up. Two shadows appear behind some rocks without anyone noticing. Then all of a sudden a piece of meat starts to rise with no one touching it. This catches Luffy's attention. It is then revealed that it is rising due to a fishing rod pulling it up. Luffy still not noticing this, thinks that the meat is floating and talking. Once the two shadows pull the meat in, they start running away. Luffy chases after it.
It is then revealed as two boys trying to get food because they are starving. They had not eaten in ten days. As they start eating it, Ace asks if they came from the badland. They are shocked for a second that they were caught. They then get aggressive and scared of Ace, asking who are you, and saying that they won't give back the food. The eldest brother pulls out a revolver and says, ""One move and you're a dead man."" Ace does not appear to be scared. Instead he smirks and calmly states, ""Dangerous things like that won't frighten me."" The brother fires the weapon and Ace easily deflects it.
The Straw Hats come up behind Ace asking who they are. The eldest brother drops the revolver and says, ""We have something to ask of you. We need you to find and capture a man."" The two boys pull out a picture of Scorpion.
Returning to Scorpion, he is still waiting for the fuse to go off, even though it is no longer burning. He asks if Popo is ready, but he then realizes that Popo ate the fuse. Scorpion screams at Popo which catches Luffy's attention, who is right under where they are located. Luffy hops up and starts talking to them. In the commotion, Scorpion looses track of Ace.
The two boys tell Ace that they have traveled all across the badlands looking for him. Usopp asks who is the person they are looking for. Nami tells Usopp it is a bounty hunter called Scorpion. Ace tells them that he has business with Scorpion because the person who defeated Blackbeard in Yuba was called Scorpion.
Luffy finds out the person he is talking to is the bounty hunter Scorpion. He tells Luffy that he is going to find and kill Fire Fist Ace. Luffy tells him that is funny and Scorpion responds by telling him ""Don't mock me"" in a playful tone.
The two boys realize who Ace is. They ask Ace if he is the real Ace, but he is too busy scanning the desert for something. Usopp asks if there is something wrong. He responds by saying, ""Two men and a bird.""
Scorpion rides up with Luffy and says, ""I am Scorpion and I am going to defeat you."" He is very nervous and it is obvious he is faking everything. They set up a 'true' battle between him and Ace.
Scorpion shoots a net at Ace, but he knocks it away back onto Scorpion. Then Ace quickly punches and defeats him. Ace tells Scorpion that he could not have defeated Blackbeard because he is too weak.
The eldest boy yells, ""That is enough, Dad!"" Everyone is surprised that Scorpion is their father. It turns out that they were originally farmers. Once the drought set in, their farm died. The father told his children that he would become a bounty hunter, take down Ace, and return rich.
His children now tell him that he is no match for Fire Fist Ace. He chuckles and nervously says, ""What are you saying? Your dad is now the world's greatest bounty hunter."" Scorpion gives a speech to his children, and returns to the fight. His children beg him not too. Just as he is about to launch the rocket, his children tell him to stop. He drops the rocket and it goes off and hits a rock. The rock explodes sending smaller rocks towards them. Ace then saves all three of them from a certain death. They then return home to the badlands. At the end of all of this, Ace is about to leave. Before he leaves he gives Luffy a piece of paper and tells Luffy that next time they see each other it will be at the top of Pirates Summit. Afterwards, he says goodbye and vanishes.","Scorpion, Popo, Portgas D. Ace, Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp, Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Nefertari Vivi, Nami, Chip and Dip, Tony Tony Chopper, Matsuge",
Episode 102,"Ruins and Lost Ways! Vivi, Her Friends, and the Country's Form!",24-Feb-02,"Zoro, Chopper, and Luffy manage to get themselves lost because of Luffy's hallucinations and stumble across some huge underground ruins which has a Poneglyph.","This episode starts off with Luffy hallucinating because of dehydration. The crew is very confused on what he is doing, as he runs around the desert screaming random names. He starts throwing punches at people that are not there. Nami tells Zoro to get Chopper, but they see Chopper has collapsed because of the heat. Since Chopper has collapsed and cannot help Luffy, Nami tells Zoro to take care of Luffy. When Zoro starts walking towards Luffy to get him, Nami and the rest of the crew start off again, as they want to get to Yuba as fast as possible. When they start off Vivi thinks to herself that Luffy, Zoro, and Chopper probably will not be all right, foreshadowing that they will not be.
Zoro approaches Luffy, dragging Chopper, and tells Luffy to calm down. Luffy who is throwing punches at his hallucinogenic enemies, mistakes Zoro as Crocodile. He punches Zoro very hard, invoking Zoro to start fighting back. Zoro does not want to hurt Luffy, so he puts his swords away. He starts the beginning of a fist fight. The two continue throwing punches until they both punch each other very hard. This knocks both of them out. They collapse unconscious into the desert sand.
Chopper then wakes up confused on what happened, as he was asleep when they were fighting. Chopper runs over to where Zoro and Luffy are and wakes Zoro up using a pungent smelling medicine. Zoro asks Chopper where the group is and Chopper replies telling him they were gone when he arose. At first Zoro says they will just follow the group's footprints, but then he realizes the desert wind will have eroded them away.
The scene then changes to Nami and Vivi in an ancient ruin. Vivi remarks how Kingdoms change and fade away, that civilizations grow and die on this land, but the people stay the same. It is clear that she is afraid that her father's kingdom will fall to Baroque Works and become a fading kingdom. Nami tells her not to worry, that Luffy will take them down along with Crocodile. Vivi agrees, but she is still worried.
Meanwhile, with Luffy, Chopper, and Zoro, Luffy wakes up and is confused on why they are alone. Zoro punches him, telling Luffy that it is his fault and now they are lost. They set off in a random direction. Once Luffy realizes what happened, he starts complaining. Zoro and Chopper walk on ahead.
They start talking about why each one joined the crew. Chopper remarks that the crew seems so wild compared to him. Zoro then starts talking about how everyone has different goals, and their goals to be the best in what they do unite them.
While they are still talking, Luffy spots some shade and uses his rubber arm rockets to propel the three of them to the cave. Zoro sits on a rock that turns into a sink hole. He falls into a cavern. He spots the Poneglyph, and wonders what it is. Luffy and Chopper then both fall into the cavern and join Zoro.
When their eyes have adjusted, they realize they are in a dome built by humans. Zoro, Luffy, and Chopper decide to leave and catch up with the rest of the group. Luffy swings his arm trying to get up and out of the underground dome, but misses making it slowly collapse. He finally succeeds and zooms out of the dome. They are sent flying into the sky. When they land Chopper smells that the wind has changed. He catches wind of Nami's perfume. They head off in that direction to meet up with the group.
The perspective changes back to the rest of the group. Nami and Vivi start talking about Luffy and how the crew came about. Nami says that in the pirate crew each person has an ability. Zoro has his swords, Nami is a navigator, Usopp is the liar, Luffy is the fighter, Chopper is the doctor, and Sanji is the cook. Each one of them plays a crucial role in the fabric of the Straw Hat Pirates and without each and every one of them doing their role, the crew would fall apart. This is how they can trust each other, through the fact that they know each one of them has some unique trait that allows them to be able to get through anything. Vivi is impressed with her answer and overall likes that theory. She turns her head and sees Luffy, Chopper, and Zoro coming over the horizon. She now knows Nami is right, that she does not have to worry because each crew member is powerful and loyal.","Roronoa Zoro, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

He ponders what it is and why Ace gave it to him. The rest of the crew also look at it and also conclude that it is just a piece of paper.

Meanwhile in Crocodile's lair, he and Miss All Sunday are discussing their plan. Miss All Sunday says that all preparations are in place and they can carry out the plan in two days. Crocodile is pleased and tells her the other agents are coming from Spider Cafe to meet them.
In Spider Cafe the agents start gathering. The only one left is Mr. 1. The other agents start getting impatient and just want to leave. Mr. 2 and his men put on a dance show, but all of a sudden Mr. 1 burst through the wall knocking over one of Mr. 2's men. Mr. 2 and Mr. 1 start fighting because Mr. 2 is angry that he knocked over one of his men like that. Miss Doublefinger quickly puts an end to it. She says that they received word to go to Rainbase and meet the boss. They all go into a carriage that starts off.
Luffy and his group finally make it to Yuba. It is being ravaged by a sandstorm. After it stops, they can see that it has been abandoned. Yuba is not the oasis they were expecting. The only one left is the founder of Yuba, and they find out the rebel army has relocated to Katorea. When Luffy calls Vivi over the old man recognizes her. He runs over to her and she realizes he is Toto from her youth. His son is the rebel army's leader.

Nami states that this seems to be the quickest way of stopping the fighting from happening. Vivi takes out a map of Arabasta and shows them Alubarna's location, the capital of Arabasta where her father is, and Katorea, where the rebel army is camped. Sanji supposes that they have to get to Crocodile before the rebels invade Alubarna. She also shows them where Crocodile lives which is Rainbase and tells them it is a day's journey from where they are.
On their way to Rainbase, Usopp asks for a sip of Luffy's water given to him by Toto, but Luffy refuses to give Usopp any since the old man had to dig all night to fill the container, and that they can't just drink it like it is regular water.
Meanwhile, in the rebel base in Katorea, a boy is begging the leader of the rebel army, Koza, to join the fight. Koza dissuades the boy, but he remains determined stating he wants to fight. Koza then says that that is the reason he can't let the boy join them because none of the rebels want to fight and that the only reason they do is because they have to. Koza tells the boy to leave and then starts to discuss their plans to invade Alubarna with his men. Once they have gathered all the weapons they need from all the rebel towns, they will then begin their all-out attack on the capital.
In Alubarna, Chaka suggests to Cobra that they must take action towards the rebel army before they attack the capital. Cobra angrily refuses to attack the rebels that in doing so would be the true destruction of their kingdom. He recalls the dance powder incident and surmises that since that incident, someone has been trying to tear apart their country and that before they should act, they must determine who is really behind all of it. Chaka argues that whoever is behind it has not made himself known and that they cannot sit back and wait for whoever it is to divide them, to which the king remained adamant in his refusal to act.
While Chaka and Pell discuss Vivi and Igaram's efforts to determine the mastermind of the turmoil within their kingdom, a palace guard informs them that Karoo has returned. They rush to see Karoo and find Cobra reading the letter Vivi wrote informing him that Crocodile is without a doubt the person who is trying to destroy Arabasta Kingdom. She tells them that Igaram died protecting her. Furthermore, she says that she has teamed up with an amazing group of people who will help her save Arabasta.
Having learned of the identity of the mastermind behind their country's troubles, Cobra orders his forces to march onto Rainbase. Chaka and Pell discourage this plan saying that they will have to plan the attack and that Crocodile has the hearts of some of the citizens, even more than the King. Moreover, they are worried that the absence of the Royal Army from the capital will make it vulnerable to the rebel army's occupation. Cobra replies that he doesn't care if the rebels destroy the palace since it is only a building. It doesn't matter that the Royal Army falls in the end, as long as Crocodile is defeated, the country can still be reborn, but if they battle the rebel army, Crocodile will win. They start preparations to take down Crocodile, with Chaka readying the war council and Pell scouting ahead to conduct reconnaissance.
Meanwhile, in Rainbase, Luffy's group have finally arrived. They plan to lay low since they are under the assumption that Crocodile already knows they are on the island. However, Luffy and Usopp loudly enter a bar where Smoker and Tashigi are staying, and inadvertently sit right beside them. At first, they go unnoticed, but eventually, the two parties see each other, so Luffy and Usopp run away and are chased by the Marines. They lead the Marines to the other crew members (minus Chopper), so their plan of laying low is no longer feasible. The group decides to split up and just meet at Rain Dinners, the casino where Crocodile is.
Chopper, after going to the restroom, returns to where everyone was but sees that they are gone. He determines that everyone split up when he finds everyone's scent coming from different directions. Luffy is chased by Smoker but he manages to lose him temporarily. Vivi and Zoro are chased down by Marines but Zoro lets Vivi go ahead without him. However, he is faced by Tashigi so he runs aways, unable to handle a confrontation with her since she looks so much like his childhood friend. Usopp, Nami, and Sanji are also pursued by marines but Sanji asks Usopp to protect Nami so he can deal with the Marines. Nami and Usopp arrive at Rain Dinners and find Zoro there. Luffy arrives shortly after, again being chased by Smoker. The four of them decide to enter the casino without the others in order to escape Smoker.

Miss All Sunday shows her Devil fruit powers.","Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp run towards the Rain Dinners casino. They know that without Vivi, they do not know what Crocodile looks like and realize that Vivi is not there with them. They start shouting for both Vivi and Crocodile but realize this is useless. Smoker catches up to them and chases them inside the casino, but the casino security personnel stop him saying that government employees are not allowed in the casino. He persists in chasing after the group and the ruckus causes casino security to try and also stop Luffy's group. They are unable to contain the commotion so the manager, Miss All Sunday, tells the personnel to send them to the VIP room.
The group is led to the VIP room and Smoker continues to give chase. Inside, the hallway is split into two, with a sign saying that VIPs should go to the left and pirates should go to the right. The group decides to go to the right, being that they are pirates. This leads to a dead-end and a trapdoor. The trapdoor opens and the group, along with Smoker, fall down said trapdoor.
Meanwhile, Chopper is still looking for his crewmates and sees Tashigi. He realizes that the Marines are after the Straw Hats and tries to stop her. However, Tashigi bumps into him and falls on top of him, her glasses also falling onto Chopper's eyes. Chopper becomes disoriented and dizzy due to the prescription of Tashigi's eyeglasses. Tashigi, unable to see without them, does not recognize Chopper who has fallen down. Sanji sees this and hides. Chopper gives back her glasses, but she still does not recognize him. Sanji and Chopper are reunited.
In the casino, Luffy's group and Smoker are inside a prison cell. Luffy notices that something is wrong as he is feeling weak all of a sudden. Smoker then hits Luffy with his jitte causing Luffy to fall and feel helpless like he's falling into the sea. Smoker explains that the tip of his weapon is made of sea prism stone which is a rare mineral that gives off a mystical energy with the same wavelength as the ocean or basically a solid form of the sea. It affects Devil Fruit users the same way as if they have fallen into the ocean. As Zoro is about to attack Smoker for attacking Luffy, Crocodile interrupts and tells them to try to get along since they are about to die together anyway.
Crocodile tells Smoker that he knows he is there on his own without orders from the government, since he knows the government trusts him completely, being a Warlord of the Sea. Crocodile then proceeds to tell them that he will deal with them after their ""guest of honor"" arrives.
Meanwhile, outside Vivi is fending off Baroque Works Billions, and she is knocked down and about to be captured. Shortly after, bullets rain down on the Billions from the sky. Pell then swoops down and carries Vivi to safety. Pell updates Vivi on her father's plans and then eliminates the Billions who were after her. Just as she is about to leave and find the Straw Hats, Miss All Sunday appears saying that she has been ""invited"" to a gathering. Vivi attacks her but is overpowered and falls down. Pell tries to take her down, but Miss All Sunday manages to use her Hana Hana no Mi Devil Fruit powers and overpowers him, too. Miss All Sunday then takes Vivi to the casino.
Back inside the prison cell, Luffy's group and Crocodile wait for Vivi and Miss All Sunday to arrive. Vivi arrives and tries to attack Crocodile, but her attack is ineffective as Crocodile has turned into sand. Crocodile reveals that he has eaten the Suna Suna no Mi fruit which turns him into a Sand Human. Crocodile then has Vivi sit down and states that the ""party"" is about to begin. Miss All Sunday then agrees and tells everyone that it is already noon and that it is time for Operation Utopia.

The boy tries to tell them that the king wasn't responsible but is too wounded to speak and the rebels are framed for the crime. Koza orders the rebel army to move.
When one of the rebel soldiers says they don't have enough weapons, another soldier says that the ship that just crashed was an armory ship. Koza proclaims that is like ""divine guidance"". Back at the palace, Chaka is astonished at the Nanohana incident, and is told by a royal soldier that all of Arabasta is headed towards the palace.

Smoker reveals to the Straw Hats that Miss All Sunday is a wanted woman, and that the World Government has been chasing after her for 20 years, along with a bounty of 70 million - almost as much as Crocodile's.

Mr. 3 retrieves the key and then throws it in the middle of three Banana Gators. While Crocodile and Miss All Sunday are speaking Crocodile reveals that he had the real key to the cell all along. Usopp has an idea where they could use Mr. 3's Devil Fruit powers to get them out. By the time Crocodile and Miss All Sunday get back to the room, they see that the Straw Hats and Smoker have left the cell. After Luffy tells Zoro to save Smoker, he lets the Straw Hats off, while the rest of the Marines chase after them.

Luffy vs. Crocodile,5-May-02,"After escaping from Rain Dinners, the Straw Hat Pirates and Vivi cross the desert to Alubarna, where the final battle will take place. Crocodile, however, manages to catch Vivi with his hook, but Luffy changes places with her and he begins the first round of their battle.","Starting from the previous episode, the Straw Hat Pirates are seen escaping to the East from pursuing Marines. However, Smoker calls them off, claiming that he is tired, and that they won't catch them. Smoker then tells a subordinate to order for backup from surrounding Marine warships straight to Arabasta.
Chopper and Matsuge seen riding a huge crab-creature called a 'Moving Crab' towards the scent of Nami's perfume. Apparently, Matsuge is friends with several animals, including the Moving Crab.
However, as the Straw Hats, Vivi, Matsuge and the Moving Crab head towards Alubarna, Crocodile's hook latches onto Vivi, pulling her away. Luffy, in a split second decision grabs onto Vivi to switch places with her and follows the hook back to Crocodile. Before engaging with the man though, Luffy orders the others to head straight to Alubarna without him, and to get Vivi home.
Finally, with one last promise to meet in Alubarna, Luffy engages Crocodile and Miss All Sunday. Luffy then addresses how kind Vivi is in her selflessness and entirety to protect her entire kingdom and solve the conflict without bloodshed. Crocodile says how hers is a foolish belief and asks if Luffy agrees with him. He does. However, Luffy claims that as long as Crocodile lives Vivi will suffer and as her friend, Luffy would stop him here. Crocodile claims that this makes Luffy an even bigger fool for becoming intimate with others and as such he will die for it.
After a taunt towards Crocodile, Miss All Sunday laughs and Crocodile asks if he should kill her too, calling her by her real name- Nico Robin. Robin then tells him to do as he wishes even though he has broken his promise to never call her by that name. She then leaves, claiming to go to Alubarna. His patience thinning, Crocodile places down a sand timer with a limit of three minutes saying that he only has that much time to 'play' with Luffy. Luffy claims that it is fine with him and starts his offense with his Gomu Gomu no Pistol attack. Crocodile evades by predictably evaporating into sand. Crocodile lunges forward with his hook, when Luffy narrowly ducks the attack.
Luffy's next attack to Crocodile's back, Gomu Gomu no Stamp is also thwarted as Crocodile's Suna Suna no Mi's abilities which seem to be impervious to physical attack. This is shown again by a futile Gomu Gomu no Gatling Gun, each attack passing through him, a Gomu Gomu no Bazooka blasting sand everywhere, and an axe kick that does no damage.
However, as Crocodile continues to try and explain to Luffy why he will never win, Luffy cuts him off by clocking his face with a haymaker that although doing no physical damage, shuts Crocodile up and enrages him. Before the three minutes are up, Crocodile decides he is done playing with Luffy even though Luffy says to have been fighting seriously the whole time. He then shows off his first impressive attack - Desert Spada (Desert Sword in italian). It sends a blade of sand towards Luffy that he once again narrowly dodges. Crocodile compliments Luffy on his quick reflexes and claims that had it hit him, he would have certainly died. Crocodile finally explains to Luffy why he will never win. Unlike Luffy, Crocodile trained his Devil Fruit powers to the point of mastering them. He claims that any Devil fruit power can be powerful in a fight as long as someone knows how to use them properly. Crocodile says to Luffy that if he has proper training, his skills can be as formidable as any, but claims that Luffy's not there yet, just like all the other fools who waste time obsessing over their abilities. Crocodile attacks again instantly afterwards with Desert Girasole (Desert Sunflower), creating a large pit of quicksand where Luffy was standing. He escapes however with another bazooka.
This is when Crocodile seems to get deadly serious. As Luffy futilely continues to attack him, Crocodile uses Barchan, which completely dehydrates Luffy's right arm. In a comedic fashion, Luffy remembers the water from Yuba, and drinks from it restoring his arm quickly. Luffy then attacks in a quite familiar fashion to the former king of Drum Kingdom Wapol by using Gomu Gomu no Baku Baku to chomp off the top part of Crocodile. Crocodile dodges, but is infuriated by Luffy's attack.
The three minutes from the sand timer have run out as well. Crocodile prepares his last attack- Sables (Sandstorm) to finish Luffy. However, it seems as if it was not actually intended for Luffy but for Yuba to the south, for the wind blows from north to south. Luffy, enraged at Crocodile's cruelty asks why. Luffy, for whatever reason thinks talking Crocodile and the sandstorm down will make it go away. Crocodile impales Luffy with his hook right in the middle of his ranting.","Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Nefertari Vivi, Nami, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Crocodile pierces Luffy in his stomach and tells him he failed. Luffy is bleeding some water caused by the one he drank earlier to rehydrate his arm. Luffy grabs his arm heavily and Crocodile is surprised he is still alive.
He throws Luffy into the quicksand and heads to Alubarna. The rest of The Straw Hats are riding on Hasami. Usopp is telling Chopper one of his stories and Zoro is working out by using Matsuge as a dumbbell. Zoro and Sanji argue with each other because Sanji thinks Zoro is scared. Nami hits them and says it's not the time to fool around. Vivi believes in Luffy and says he will meet them in Alubarna. She was the one who was worried the most. Nami bonks her on the head and say she worries about the rebellion.
Smoker orders Tashigi to go to Alubarna. She has to decide whether to pursue the Straw Hats or support the royal army while Smoker goes out to sea. Smoker says he will accept responsibility for whatever choice she makes. Nami and the others have to cross a wide river if they want to make it to Alubarna. Hasami cannot cross the ocean, so they decide to make him speed up enough to run on the water. Nami motivates Hasami by using her dancing outfit to make him run across the ocean since Hasami likes dancer girls.
They reach 3/4 across the ocean when Hasami sinks down into the sea. They swim back up and they are attacked by a Sea Monster, who is quickly defeated by the Kung-Fu Dugongs. The Kung-Fu Dugongs reply that they would never disobey their master's will (Luffy). They reach shore and see something coming after them in the distance. It is revealed to be Karoo and the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops.
Luffy is stuck in the middle of the quicksand and tries to struggle out, but is being covered in the sand. Nico Robin saves him by using her Hana Hana no Mi powers and asks him about the ""Will of the D"", also having retrieved Luffy's hat.
Pell arrives, still injured and asks Nico Robin what she did to Vivi. She replies that Luffy saved her and that she is safe, telling Pell to aid Luffy. While she leaves, Luffy grabs onto Pell while yelling for meat. Back in Alubarna the Royal Guards are preparing for battle.

Since Luffy is badly injured from his last encounter with Crocodile, Pell tells him that he does not need food, he needs a doctor right away. But Luffy pull his clothing and tells him that he will make Crocodile pay for what he did to Vivi and Toto.
Meanwhile, the Rebel Army is still on their way to Alubarna to attack the Royal Army. The elite members of Baroque Works wait for Vivi and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates to show up. Unexpectedly, Mr. 4 spots them approaching Alubarna on ducks, who are part of the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops (or Hikoichi). Vivi and the Straw Hats are all wearing similar cloaks, so it is difficult for the Baroque Works members to spot which one is Vivi. Vivi and the Straw Hats split up in different directions, which forces the Baroque Works members to split up as well.
After everyone is successfully broken into groups, the people on the ducks reveal who they are. But Princess Vivi is not in any of the groups, she did not run off with everyone else. Vivi and Karoo stand outside of Alubarna city in order to stop the Rebel Army and the Royal Army from fighting with each other. Koza sees someone in front of the city but thinks he is hallucinating. Then a cannon was shot prematurely by a Royal Army Guard, who is actually a member of the Baroque Works team. Vivi and Karoo are still standing but cannot see what is in front of them because of all the dust. Vivi shouts to Koza, yelling ""Leader"" (a name Koza had since they were kids). Koza hears it but still thinks he is imagining things during the commotion. Vivi is knocked over and sees that there are camels coming her way. Karoo acts quickly and covers her with his body and instead of her getting trampled he got trampled. Vivi gets up and sees what he did and begins to cry and tells Karoo that she will stop it no matter what.
Usopp appears on a horse, but it is actually Mr. 2. Vivi notices that it isn't actually Usopp because he calls Karoo, ""That Bird."" Vivi does not believe that the real Usopp would call Karoo that after as much as they had been through on Little Garden. She then tells the fake Usopp to prove himself with the bandage that the crew had wrapped around their arms (in previous episodes).

Mr. 2 attempts to kill Vivi, but Karoo gets up in time to get her on his back and run away, although he is not in a good condition to run fast. Karoo runs up a cliff and is unable to reach the top which is only a step away. But he remembers when Luffy told him that Vivi is the Straw Hats' friend and he flaps his wings and reaches the top. Although, Mr. 2 begins to run up the cliff too. Karoo gets hit with a stray bullet from the fighting and is no longer able to run. After falling, Karoo tells Vivi to run by signaling with his wing because Mr. 2 is getting closer. Out of nowhere two other members of the Duck Troops show up and Sanji is with them. Sanji is left to fight Mr. 2 and the two members of the Duck Troops take care of the injured Karoo.

Crocodile proceeds to tell her that Luffy would have still been alive had he not gotten involved with her. Vivi refuses to believe this and demands that Crocodile tell her where Luffy is.
Meanwhile the battle between the rebels and the Royal Army is still going on. Nami remarks that Vivi's plan to stop the rebel army at the entrance must have failed. She wonders if Vivi and the others are all right as they are all fighting while she is running and hiding. She thinks back to the day where she asks Usopp to make her a weapon so she can be strong enough not to endanger the others. Being a couple of ordinary humans with no special abilities, she says she knows that Usopp can empathize with her. Usopp agrees to make her weapon.
Miss Doublefinger finds Nami while she is hiding and stabs her shoulder using her Toge Toge no Mi abilities which allows her to grow spikes on any part of her body. Nami takes out her Clima-Tact and decides to fight her as she recalls Usopp telling her the features of her new weapon that has elemental powers.
She tries her first move, Fine Tempo, which made doves appear. She is disappointed as this ""attack"" is nothing more than a party trick. She remains optimistic thinking that at least the move has caught the enemy off guard. She tries her second move, Cloudy Tempo, which causes flowers to spout when a button is pushed. Miss Doublefinger, seeing Nami's weak attempts to attack her, feels sorry for her but proceeds to attack her with her spikes. Nami barely dodges her but is determined to fight back. She drops her Clima-Tact, but seeing no threat from Nami's weapon, Miss Doublefinger gives it back to her.
Nami launches her third move, Thunder Tempo, where a boxing glove springs from the weapon. Miss Doublefinger loses patience and attacks Nami, which she dodges. She hides and continues to read the Clima-Tact instructions desperate to find a move that can damage her enemy. She finds battle configurations at the back of the instructions. She discovers each of the three batons of her weapon have special qualities. The first can create hot air, emitting a hot ball. The second can create cool air, emitting a cool ball, and the third can create electricity, emitting a thunderball. She tests this out, but Usopp's instructions state that these features have not yet been perfected but can be used at parties.
Miss Doublefinger proceeds to attack Nami again, and she runs away. Nami is stabbed on her calf, and she falls down. Just as Miss Doublefinger is about to give the finishing blow, Nami swings her Clima-Tact and she unintentionally uses the Cyclone Tempo, the effect of which is like a boomerang. As she is studying her weapon, Nami has her back turn against her enemy which insults Miss Doublefinger and causes her to attack Nami. Nami is seemingly skewered by the attack, but a dove flies towards the skewered Nami revealing that it was just an illusion. Nami explains that she used the Mirage Tempo where her Clima-Tact allowed her to create a mirage of herself. Finally getting a better understanding of how the Clima-Tact works, Nami tells Miss Doublefinger that she is now ready to actually fight.
Meanwhile, Crocodile has taken Cobra and nails him to the palace walls. Vivi and Chaka are unable to do anything. He tells them that he has no intention of keeping Cobra or Vivi alive and will kill them after he gets what he has really been after since the very beginning. He then asks Cobra where the Pluton is.

Elsewhere, Nami attempts to further understand the Clima-Tact and reads Usopp's instructions on the special Tornado Tempo attack as Miss Doublefinger continues her attack.

At the Alubarna North Block, Miss Doublefinger continues to attack Nami, leaving her injured and bleeding but Nami buys enough time to create a thundercloud and launches an electric shock on Miss Doublefinger. Angry and injured, Miss Doublefinger again attacks Nami at which point Nami reveals her Mirage Tempo ability which manipulates the humidity of the atmosphere to create mirages. This allows Nami to go behind Miss Doublefinger and remember the information from Usopp that warns her that Tornado Tempo is a one-time attack only. Nami remembers the dangers the crew has been through and resolves to continue fighting for Vivi's sake, but her injured leg is causing her to falter. Seeing an opportunity, Miss Doublefinger attacks with her Sea Urchin Stinger, and Nami stops the attack with her leg.
Nami launches the Tornado Tempo, which initially does not do anything, but then wraps around Miss Doublefinger and launches her through buildings, ending the fight in Nami's victory.

After a prolonged battle where Zoro displays a wide variety of techniques against the assassin, he thinks back back to when his old mentor said that a swordsman who can cut nothing can cut anything including steel. Still not understanding this idea, he is forced onto the defensive from Mr. 1's attacks which climax with the latter creating multiple spinning blades on his arms, landing a direct hit on the swordsman. Unable to defend against it, Zoro falls against a pillar and Mr. 1 delivers what he believes is the final blow that further wounds Zoro and destroys the pillar he was leaning on, causing the pillar and arch fall on top of him.
Mr. 1 begins to walk away but quickly notices that Zoro has gotten up once again. Wondering out loud how Zoro was able to dodge all the flying debris, the swordsman claims that he did not dodge it all, and that he just was able to sense where no debris was falling and went there. Further elaborating to himself, Zoro notes that he can sense the rhythm of all things around him and can tell where his sword is, turning over a stone to find it. Picking it up, he then turns and slashes at some leaves on a tree without cutting them before then cutting a rock clean in half. Finally coming to an understanding of his teacher's words, he then attacks Mr. 1 with only one sword. Zoro then proves he is finally able to cut Mr. 1 and defeats him, collapsing to the ground and wonders if everyone else is okay.","Roronoa Zoro, Mr. 1, Dracule Mihawk (flashback), Koushirou (flashback), Kuina (flashback, picture), Monkey D.

He attempts to stop the fighting but is shot by a Baroque Works agent hidden in the Royal Army.","The Tsumegeri Guards charge into the palace to attempt to save Cobra. Cobra orders them not to attack as they will just be throwing away their lives. The Guards tell their King that they have sworn to protect him even to the death. Acknowledging their reputation, Crocodile offers to spare their lives if they leave and go home, to which they refuse. However, before they can attack, their bodies show signs changes and bruising. Chaka explains that to temporarily increase their power they must have drank Hero Water which grants incredible strength but kills the host and that they are good as dead. They proceed to attack Crocodile, but he turns himself into sand and dodges their attack. Crocodile states that he won't bother to fight them since they're going to die anyway. Shortly thereafter, the Tsumegeri Guards all collapse and die. Crocodile laughs at this which angers Chaka causing him to attack Crocodile. Chaka reveals his Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Jackal devil fruit power. He is, however, unable to land a blow due to Crocodile's powers.
Meanwhile, after his fight, Zoro collapses due to loss of blood. As he lies barely conscious, he wonders how the others are doing and that they better not be dead. With this, he thinks about Usopp. In another part of the city, Sanji, along with Chopper and Usopp who are being carried by Matsuge, are running towards the palace. Usopp is in tears, remembering that Miss Merry Christmas told them that Luffy is dead. Chopper tearfully tells him that it might not be true while Sanji, with a smile on his face, asks them if they truly believed that. They answer that they believe Luffy is still alive.
Cutting back to Zoro, he is now thinking about Nami and wondering if she managed to escape. Nami is then shown somewhere in Alubarna - North Block, detangling her Clima-Tact's final attack from Miss Doublefinger's body. She then proceeds to go to the palace.
Zoro then wonders if Vivi is okay. Vivi is then shown calling out Chaka's name with Chaka lying down on the ground, bloodied. A figure then approaches Vivi and calls out her name.
Scene cuts to the Palace Square, showing that there are 25 minutes left until the time of the explosion Crocodile has planned.
The figure is revealed to be Koza, who is in disbelief on what he is seeing before him. He sees the Tsumegeri Guards dead on the ground, Chaka bloodied and lifeless, Cobra nailed to the palace walls, and that Crocodile, the supposed country's hero, is behind it all. Crocodile is amused at the turn of events where the country is in the midst of war and the leaders of both sides are not on the battlefield but are standing at his feet.
Miss All Sunday ridicules Koza's confusion and offers to ""help"" him understand. She tells him to relax and open his mind and think of the worst possible scenario. Koza realizes that his father was right about Cobra and that he was wrong to doubt him. Koza demands to know who was responsible for the drought ravaging Arabasta, where Crocodile answers that for the past two years, every single malicious thing Koza attributed to Cobra was in fact perpetuated by him and his company, Baroque Works. Crocodile continues to taunt Koza, but Cobra calls his attention and demands that he listen. Cobra asks him to save as many citizens as he can. Chaka tells him about the bomb in the palace square and to hurry. Crocodile, seeing that Chaka is still alive, proceeds to strike him once more seemingly killing him.
Koza runs towards the palace square, but Vivi chases him and pulls him to the ground. She implores him to listen and think things through. She explains that if they tell everyone that the palace square will explode, everyone will panic which will add more chaos to the battle and that even if they stop the bomb, it doesn't really stop the fighting and people are still going to die. She tells him that they have to stop the rebellion instead and that he is the only one who can do it. Hearing their plans, Crocodile tries to stop them and attempts to strike Vivi but is blocked by Chaka giving them time to get away.
Vivi reaches the Royal Army and commands them to surrender immediately. Koza then comes out and tells the Royal Army that they no longer need to fight and that they just want to end the conflict. As the rebel army approaches the palace square, they see the Royal Army waving white flags of surrender. They also see their leader, Koza waving a white flag. He tells them to quiet their anger and lower their weapons. He announces that the battle is over. However, he is shot multiple times by what looks like a soldier of the Royal Army but is actually a Baroque Works agent who has infiltrated their ranks. Vivi screams in horror.","Nico Robin, Nefertari Vivi, Chaka, Crocodile, Nefertari Cobra, Tsumegeri Guards, Pandaman, Mr. 1, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Matsuge, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops (flashback), Nami, Miss Doublefinger, Karoo (flashback), Monkey D.

Episode 121,Vivi's Voice Goes Unheard! A Hero Descends!,11-Aug-02,"As Koza desperately tries to stop the Rebel Army, both sides begin fighting again due to the intervention of Baroque Works. Vivi is thrown to almost certain death, before Luffy suddenly saves her and challenges Crocodile to another fight.","Koza is shot by Baroque Works agents that have infiltrated the Royal Guards and as he collapses, he tries to tell the Rebel Army not to fight. The Royal Guards confront the solider that shot Koza but as Koza once again tries to talk to the Rebel Army, a sandstorm blows through the palace obscuring the battlefield and allowing Baroque Works agents that have infiltrated both sides to fire more shots towards the Rebel Army and Royal Guard, triggering a clash between them.
Vivi and Koza try to stop the fighting, but their voices are drowned out by the fighting occurring in the Palace Square. In the Palace, Chaka succumbs to his wounds and collapses and King Cobra tells Vivi to run away which she refuses, pointing out that Crocodile was the cause of the sandstorm and that she still wanted to stop the bomb that is set to explode in fifteen minutes, to at least save some of the fighters in the Palace Square. 
Crocodile then grabs Vivi by the neck, telling her she was too weak to have those zealous ideals, and she reminds him that as the Princess of the country, she will never yield to him or give up. Crocodile reminds Vivi that the Rebel Army reinforcements are still arriving and will walk into the range of the blast and then hangs her over the cliff by the neck as he lambastes her for her decision not to tell the soldiers about the bomb, pointing out that despite the panic, at least a few thousand would've survived. Crocodile notes that Vivi had been working as a spy in Baroque Work for two years and then drops her off the cliff.
In the distance, Luffy arrives flying on Pell to Crocodile's shock. They catch Vivi before she hits the ground, and she tells them about the bomb that is set to explode. At the Palace Square, Luffy and Vivi meet up with Chopper, Sanji and Usopp as well as Zoro who had been carrying Nami. Luffy apologizes for losing to Crocodile and promises not to lose again and tells them to take care of the other matters as he stretches up towards the Palace to fight Crocodile.
Crocodile attempts to dodge Luffy's hit, only to be punched in the face, making him bleed slightly. Before he could recover, Luffy attacks him again and Crocodile begins to realize that Luffy has uncovered his weakness. Luffy explains that he found his weakness after their first fight when the water he got from Yuba spilled on Crocodile, preventing him from turning to sand.

Meanwhile, the other Straw Hat Pirates hurry to locate the bomb before it goes off. Nico Robin forces King Cobra to take her to the tomb where the Pluton Poneglyph is hidden.","With Crocodile lying on the ground, Luffy demands that he get up and fight. Crocodile laughs at this statement.
Meanwhile, Vivi and the rest of the Straw Hats are in the Palace Square. Vivi explains that according to Crocodile, within ten minutes, a huge cannon will be fired, and once the cannon is fired, no one within a five-kilometer radius will survive, wiping out both the Rebel and Royal Army forces. Zoro tells them that they need to find the cannon and stop the cannoneer from shooting. Before they can go ahead and look for the cannon, some Baroque Works Billions find Vivi and try to bring her to Crocodile for a promotion. Sanji and Zoro volunteer to stay behind to deal with the agents while the others go ahead and split up to look for the cannon.
Crocodile is still laughing at Luffy's statement, telling him that it will not be so easy to defeat him, since he is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy is unimpressed and says that if Crocodile is one of the Seven Warlords, then he is the eighth Warlord. Cobra cannot believe what he is hearing and is impressed by Luffy's confidence. He asks who Luffy is, and Miss All Sunday tells him that he is the one responsible for bringing Vivi back to Arabasta.
Even though Luffy has figured out how to land a punch on Crocodile, the Warlord is still confident stating that even though Luffy can hit him, he can still absorb any fluid in Luffy's body. He proceeds to dehydrate Luffy's arm, which Luffy counters by drinking more water. The two continue their battle and Luffy reveals that he was planning to throw the barrel of water he was carrying to douse Crocodile in water. Crocodile predicts this move and counters it by conjuring a twister of sand, sending both Luffy and the barrel flying away. Luffy barely catches the barrel of water. Crocodile laughs at Luffy, telling him that this battle is no different from the first time they fought. Luffy proceeds to drink the whole barrel of water he was carrying and dubs himself as Water Luffy, showing a bloated stomach full of water, which shocks both Crocodile and Cobra and amuses Miss All Sunday.
Cobra attacks Luffy but Luffy squirts out water from his mouth and douses Crocodile with water, just as he planned, making the Warlord susceptible to Luffy's physical attacks. Luffy uses his Gomu Gomu no Bazooka technique and hits Crocodile directly to his stomach which sends him crashing. Crocodile is lying on the ground, not moving. Miss All Sunday removes the stakes impaling Cobra and demands that he show her the way to the Poneglyph. Cobra asks what she wants with it, but she subdues him and reiterates her demand.
Crocodile gets up and calls Miss All Sunday by her real name, Nico Robin, telling her that she should get going now to the Poneglyphs. As Nico Robin and the King leave, Crocodile uses his Ground Secco technique which dehydrates all of their surroundings turning it to a desert wasteland. Luffy shoots water at Crocodile which he simply absorbs with his hand. He continues to suck the moisture out of ground, the effects of which are felt throughout the palace.
With eight minutes left until the explosion, Vivi, Pell and the rest of the Straw Hats scramble to find the cannon.
Meanwhile, Cobra asks if Nico Robin is truly Miss All Sunday's name. He remembers that the name was known throughout the world twenty years ago. On their way to the Poneglyphs, they encounter Tashigi and a bunch of Marines. Tashigi refuses to let them pass, but Robin uses her abilities to incapacitate some of her men. Seeing the ability, a Marine recognizes who she is and tells Tashigi that twenty years ago, when she was eight years old, Robin earned a bounty of 79,000,000 for sinking six Marine ships, classifying her as a first-degree risk. After the incident, she was said to have vanished and never heard from again. After hearing about her reputation, Tashigi commands her men to go to the Palace Square to stop the explosion, deeming it useless for so many men to fight against someone with her power. She stays behind, deciding to fight her, but Robin uses her ability against Tashigi and easily defeats her.
In the palace, the entire lawn has turned to sand. Crocodile is able to sneak up on Luffy and grab him by the neck. Luffy spits water at Crocodile but misses and he proceeds to absorb all of the water in Luffy's body, dehydrating him. Luffy's signature straw hat is shown to be blown away by the wind. While still holding Luffy by the neck, Crocodile declares that Luffy has lost to him for the second time.","Crocodile, Nico Robin, Nefertari Cobra, Monkey D.

When Luffy recovers from the last round of fighting, he chases after Crocodile into the tomb.","Luffy's body water got dried out by Crocodile leaving Luffy close to death. However, the water he had shot out at Crocodile came falling and landed on him which brought him back to life. After Luffy recovered, he went searching for Crocodile. Nico Robin and King Cobra, on the way to the royal tomb, encountered the Marines and were ordered to surrender, however she overcame them easily. Sometime afterwards, Crocodile came by and laughed at them for being easily overcome.
Meanwhile, the remainder of the Straw Hat crew, Vivi and Pell are still in search of the hidden cannon and time is counting down fast. Luffy, on the pursuit of Crocodile, came by Tashigi and requested which route Crocodile took. After some contemplation, she showed Luffy the way Crocodile went and scolded herself after he took off. Upon nearing the tomb, Luffy began to bleed and fell to the ground sleeping. Meanwhile, with the help of Cobra, Nico Robin found the Poneglyph and started reading it. Crocodile at this point had reached the location of the Poneglyph as well. The Straw Hats are still in search of the bomb.
Upon encountering the Poneglyph, Nico Robin read and inquired from Cobra if there were any more Poneglyphs in the country and Cobra asked if she was disappointed by the one they found. Crocodile finds them and tells Nico Robin to read what is written on the Poneglyph. She began reading however, she was simply reading the history of Arabasta to him. On hearing that, Crocodile got very upset and asked if the Poneglyph revealed the location of the ancient weapon – Pluton. Nico Robin answered him saying nothing of the name Pluton is mentioned in this Poneglyph. Crocodile then told her that she has been useful for the four years they had been together operating Baroque Works. However, she would have to die since she broke her promise of not giving him the location of Pluton after reading the Poneglyph. Nico Robin tried to kill him but failed. At that point, Cobra had initiated a timer that would destroy the underground tomb stating that both Crocodile and Nico Robin would die along with him because he would never let Crocodile have the ""Country of Sand.""
During the search of the bomb Vivi ends up with a skinned knee when one of her platform sandal straps disintegrates from all the abusive running that has worn it apart and sends her tumbling onto the hard, stony road. Losing her other sandal in the fall, she is forced to abandon the ruined pair and continue running barefoot, making her search all the more painful as her unprotected feet get beaten up while she dashes through the rough streets of Alubarna. She got a revelation of the possible location of the bomb and had Usopp summon the remainder of the Straw Hats when they crossed the streets. Luffy is finally awake from his nap and went running searching for Crocodile. Crocodile informs Cobra that his plan to bury all three of them together is futile because he is able to turn the bedrock of the tomb to sand and make his escape.","Monkey D.

Usopp had signaled the other member of The Straw Hat Pirates (in the previous episode) with one of his sling shot bombs. But Billions from the Baroque Works had found them instead. To distract them, Usopp uses a chalkboard and drags his nails down it to make a loud noise; he grabs Vivi and runs away.
Meanwhile, Luffy finds where Crocodile, Nefertari Cobra, and the critically injured Nico Robin is. Crocodile is upset that Luffy is still alive, no matter how many times he defeats Luffy. Cobra is baffled by who the strange boy is (Luffy). Luffy demands that Crocodile give him back Vivi's country, so Vivi can smile again. Luffy punches Crocodile twice and Crocodile is confused about how he is doing it without water. Luffy was using his blood to touch Crocodile preventing Crocodile from using his powers from the devil fruit. Crocodile takes off a covering from his hook that reveals he has poison in it.
Zoro runs to where the smoke bomb was shot by Usopp. But finds a group of Marines who were with Tashigi. They berate him for having a poor sense of direction and then give him orders on where to go to find the center of the city of Alubarna.
Vivi and Usopp are still running with Baroque Works members chasing them. Tashigi and a few Marine members attack the men chasing Vivi and Usopp. Nami and Tony Tony Chopper find Vivi and Usopp with two minutes left before the bomb kills the Royal Army and Rebel Army and everyone in the center of Alubarna. Pell is shot from the sky by a mysterious frog woman hidden in the Clock Tower who is later revealed to be working for Baroque Works.
Luffy and Crocodile continue their fight and Luffy dodges Crocodile's attacks made by his hook. Cobra notices that Crocodile is struggling in the fight.

Mr. 7 and Miss Father's Day speak with joy about firing the bomb because that is their last mission from the boss and believe that they will get a promotion. Luffy continues to fight Crocodile, but the poison from Crocodiles hook has entered a wound on Luffy's shoulder, making his body numb. Crocodile tells Luffy that he should have forgotten about Vivi because he would have avoided such situations he has been in.
Meanwhile, Nami came up with an idea to stop the bomb with the weapon Usopp created for her. The plan is aiding Vivi up the clock tower, starting by having her sitting on Chopper, who is standing on Usopp's shoulders. Nami then threw her Clima-Tact between his legs using Cyclone Tempo, making him jump high enough for Chopper to jump towards Sanji, who kicks them towards Zoro. While midair and only seven seconds left, Mr. 7 and Miss Father's Day's sees them coming, and shoots at them, but only hits Zoro, who managed to push Chopper and Vivi out of the way and high enough for Chopper to throw Vivi towards the clock tower. With five seconds left, Vivi is able to cut the fuse that will activate the bomb.
Meanwhile, Crocodile laughs at how pathetic Luffy looks with the poison running through his body. Crocodile tells Nefertari Cobra that he was well-prepared for this big event and the time bomb would do plenty of damage from where it is placed, and it would only delay the bomb for a couple of seconds or so.
Vivi finds out that the canon is also a time bomb, and cries with frustration because she sees that Crocodile is mocking at her. He had told her before that she will not succeed in saving her beloved country no matter what she does. Pell shows up and while Vivi is trying to tell him about the time bomb, he speaks of how the Clock Tower brings back so many memories from Vivi's childhood.
In Pell's flashback he tells Vivi that he is a guard that is there to protect his country. He takes the time bomb and flies up towards the sky.

Even though he got the bomb away, the shock wave still knocks people down and damages buildings. None of the Straw Hats on the surface can believe it, either. Even worse, the residents of Alubarna just get up and start killing each other again. Tashigi is held back by Marines on the scene from interfering. Having lost all hope, Vivi just starts repeatedly screaming, ""PLEASE STOP FIGHTING!"", from the bell tower. Only the Straw Hats can hear her. Nami sensing Vivi's pain and frustration tells the others to go stop the civil war at all costs.
Under Alubarna, the tomb is crumbling. King Cobra and Miss All-Sunday are both out, as well as apparently Luffy. Crocodile revels in what seems to be his ultimate victory. However, Luffy gets up, much to Crocodile's shock. Cobra comes to as well as Luffy declares he cannot be beaten. Crocodile tries to get him with his hook again, but Luffy kicks it away so hard the hook breaks off.
Luffy starts beating on Crocodile, and is making headway, throwing him through the ruins. Crocodile has no idea why the scorpion venom is not working on Luffy. He deploys a knife from the stub of his hook, but when he lunges at Luffy, he gets kicked up into the ruins' rafters. Tired of these games, he uses Sables Pasado to blow away more ruins. Luffy inflates his body, then twists and blows, rifling up toward Crocodile. Luffy begins Gomu Gomu no Storm, using his Gatling attack while rocketing toward his enemy. Crocodile counters with Desert La Spada, forming a giant set of claw blades, but they are neutralized by Luffy's blood-soaked fists. Crocodile gets pummeled against the ceiling of the ruins. To Cobra's shock, Crocodile is eventually driven through several feet of bedrock and hundreds of feet into the air above Alubarna.
The Straw Hats and Vivi see Crocodile's unconscious body tumble through the air, and Vivi recalls reading about the worsening situation in Arabasta during their journey. Although the Straw Hats rejoice in Luffy's victory initially, the civil war continues to rage around them. As Vivi continues to beg them to stop, rain suddenly begins to fall. As they feel Alubarna's first rainfall in three years, the people finally stop fighting. Eventually the dust clears, and the people finally hear Vivi's pleas to stop fighting.

The people are still angry that King Cobra apparently attacked Nanohana. At this point, Chaka orders the Royal Army of Arabasta to stand down. Also, Igaram appears, to Vivi's relief as she descends the clock tower. He presents Kappa, the kid who was allegedly hurt by the Royal Army in Nanohana. Kappa testifies to the treachery of Crocodile and Baroque Works, and how Mr. 2 Bon Kurei impersonated King Cobra. The people finally agree to throw their weapons down for good.
In the streets, the Straw Hat Pirates are met by King Cobra, who is carrying Luffy, weak but alive. Sanji doesn't know who Cobra is at first, until Vivi runs to him and hugs him. Cobra said Luffy somehow found the strength to carry both of them up to the surface. He also says Luffy got an antidote for Crocodile's poison, though he'll still need to be treated for his injuries. The Straw Hats say they'll make their way to the palace incognito when they're ready, since they're wanted.
The people gather around the disgraced Crocodile as the Marines arrive with Tashigi. Tashigi reveals that her men had confiscated Baroque Works ships with ""Dance Powder"", a powder that can induce rain, and linked them to Crocodile. She strips him of his title as Warlord of the Sea and places him under arrest, though he's still unconscious and can't resist anyway. The rest of Baroque Works is out of commission...except for Mr. 2, who sneaks through Alubarna to get away. Koza tries to reconcile the actions of the rebellion as he digests Crocodile's treachery. But King Cobra tells his people they can get past this ugly moment in their history, and Arabasta can continue to move forward.
On the coastline, Hina accuses Smoker of using the Dance Powder. Smoker says he knows King Cobra was trying to protect his kingdom without using it, and didn't want to ruin that. He asks Hina to take the ship they are aboard, the Baroque Works rainmaker ship, and Crocodile to Headquarters. Tashigi also orders the Marines in her unit to turn a blind eye to the Straw Hats. The wounded are cleared from Alubarna's square, and Koza assures Vivi that he'll be fine. The people of Arabasta rejoice at the return of the rain. That evening, back at the palace, the Straw Hats finally made it back and are now recuperating from their injuries. Vivi is watching the rain in their room when Igaram came in. He eulogizes Pell and honors his bravery in protecting the kingdom.
The next day, at the port where the Marines are moored, Tashigi arrives with Crocodile. She reports to Smoker, and apologizes for letting Luffy go. Smoker ignores it. Tashigi feels as if she could not figure out what true justice was in the situation and was ashamed that she assisted the Straw Hats in defeating Crocodile. Smoker starts talking about ambition, and how some he knows are making names for themselves. Smoker provides no comfort to the conflicted Tashigi, only telling her to get stronger if she is feels she is not up to the task. She declares she will, and he tells the other soldiers they can only wish for guts like hers.
Marine Headquarters places a Den Den Mushi call in to Smoker, requesting he and Tashigi report in. They have ignored his report, and are crediting him and Tashigi with the apprehension of Crocodile, with promotions in rank to match. Hina says the World Government wants to cover up the Straw Hats' involvement. Unwilling to accept that, Smoker angrily tells the World Government what they can do with their promotion.","Nefertari Vivi, Chaka, Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Nami, Usopp, Igaram, Kappa, Tony Tony Chopper, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, Koza, Kebi, Nefertari Cobra, Monkey D.

As she passes by, Vivi notes that he was trained as a doctor on Drum Island. Dr. Ho notes he did not know about Chopper's techniques despite 40 years of training himself. Chopper goes into his usual routine of responding to praise with insults, but Dr. Ho translates them as appreciation. Vivi cares for Luffy at a nearby bed, with Karoo laying at the next bed over.
Sanji and Usopp walk through the capital city as it rebuilds, remarking at the people's resilience as they rebuild. Sanji quickly walks away from one area when he recalls that a particular set of holes through a series of buildings was caused by him. Zoro is elsewhere, working on his concentration by balancing boulders on his fists, seeking to be able to call upon his utmost skills at the shortest notice. In the palace library, King Cobra encourages Nami to take as many books as she likes back with her when the Straw Hats depart. Chaka and his guards hold off Marines who are looking for Luffy and Zoro while Sanji and Usopp, who are not yet wanted, walk by unnoticed.
Luffy soon wakes up, and is feeling much better. He looks for his hat, then quickly feels hungry, and is conflicted between looking for his hat and finding food. Usopp points out Luffy's straw hat on the next bed over; it was found at the ruins by a soldier. Luffy had no idea that he was in bad shape when he was brought to the palace infirmary, and thanks Chopper and Vivi for nursing him back to health. Zoro enters, and Luffy says to him ""Long time, no see"", then gets puzzled as to why he says it. Zoro gets yelled at by Chopper for ignoring his advice to take it easy. Apparently, Luffy had been asleep for three days; he calculates that he missed 15 meals. A figure comes in, sensing Luffy's awakening. At first Zoro thinks it's Igaram crossdressing, but it's actually his wife, Terracotta, the royal chef. Zoro notes how disturbingly similar she looks to Igaram. She is personally overseeing the banquet to thank Luffy for rescuing Vivi and her husband. Having heard of Luffy's legendary appetite, she has brought a large tray of fruit for Luffy to tide him over before dinner. He scarfs the entire tray up in a split-second. Terracotta looks forward to the challenge of feeding Luffy.
At the banquet that follows, the palace guards stand in disbelief as the Straw Hats gorge themselves, especially Luffy, who has a bad habit of eating food off other people's plates. Sanji is concerned over how fast Chopper is sucking down pasta. Usopp puts the contents of one of his Tabasco no Boshi on a rice ball as a trick; Luffy eats it, of course, and spits fire. Sanji starts to get recipes from the servers. Vivi just laughs at the spectacle, and soon even the guards can't help but laugh as the banquet gets even more raucous. It eventually involves the nose chopsticks. All the while, Terracotta cooks happily, embracing the challenge.
Later on, Cobra invites the Straw Hats to the baths. Eventually, Sanji asks Igaram to show him toward the ladies' side of the bath, so he can do some peeping. He gets offended, but Cobra himself points at a wall they can look over, even though his daughter is in there. Nami and Vivi have that side of the bath to themselves, even though it is as spacious and lavish as the men's side. Nami wonders if a ship could carry such a bath. Vivi notes of all the wonderful things they have seen on their voyage together. As they get ready to switch so Nami can wash Vivi, they notice all the men looking over the wall; Luffy, Sanji, Usopp, Chopper, even Cobra and Igaram (only Zoro absent). Nami has a simple solution. She stands, pulling her towel around her, and tells the men they will owe her 100,000 each for this. She then unleashes her most diabolical move: Happiness Punch. She opens her towel, baring her entire body to the guys. They are all stunned, getting massive nosebleeds and falling back to their side, Sanji mumbling.
With their bath back to themselves, Nami notes the Straw Hats might leave Arabasta that evening. There's no reason for them to stay, and the Marines are probably looking for them by now. This news startles Vivi. On the men's side, Cobra does something unexpected by bowing to the Straw Hats. Igaram is alarmed by his un-kingly display of bowing to another man, but Cobra notes there's no such thing as a naked king. He is thanking them as a resident of Arabasta for saving his kingdom, and as a father for saving his daughter. Nami and Vivi overhear Cobra's gesture.
As night falls over the palace, Nami officially suggests to the others that they leave tonight. Zoro and Sanji agree with her reasoning. Luffy wants some more food, but Zoro says they have to leave immediately. Elsewhere in the palace, Chaka and Igaram have received a new bounty poster for Luffy, and one for Zoro as well. Luffy's bounty has been raised to 100,000,000, and Zoro now has a bounty of 60,000,000. Igaram remarks that Luffy can not turn back now that he's defeated one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
Later that night, Igaram runs to warn the Straw Hats, but they are already gone, only Vivi left in their room. Vivi tells him they've already left.
Elsewhere in Arabasta, two Marine Sergeants appear on a ship. One of them is Jango, who has turned traitor on the pirate movement. The other is Fullbody, who has apparently gotten new clout among the Marines. They have taken down a pirate ship, and are dancing in victory. On the nearby dock, Hina is disappointed that their operation took so long. Another Marine notes that all harbors are blockaded, but the Going Merry has gone missing from Erumalu. She orders the Marines to search all over for their ship. Jango and Fullbody return to Hina. She orders them to begin patrol for the Straw Hat Pirates, to their excitement.
The Straw Hats are running across the desert on a group of riding ducks. Luffy is still eating; Sanji shares that he got some recipes and spices from Terracotta so he can make some native dishes in the future. Chopper looks at Nami, who is feeling down right now. Sanji suspects she's thinking about Vivi. Nami says she's down because she's giving up the 1 billion ransom she originally extorted from Igaram. Everyone is shocked that she's feeling down about giving up the money, as opposed to leaving Vivi behind. Usopp ends up falling off his duck.
Igaram wants Vivi to ride to the Straw Hats and warn them about their increased bounties, but Vivi knows Karoo will never be able to catch them by now. Vivi insists they'll be alright, and pushes Igaram out of the room so she can sleep. She is due to address the people of Arabasta the next day. Igaram is concerned that she is too calm about it. Before she goes to bed, Vivi notes how quiet it is now that she's away from the Straw Hats.
Earlier in the day, the Straw Hats got a call over Den Den Mushi from somebody named ""Bon-chan"". They recognize it as Bon Kurei. Luffy wonders what he wants. He claims that he's taken their ship to the upper Sandora River, and that they are now friends. Zoro says they have no choice but to go where he took their ship, and keep a watchful eye on if he has any tricks for them. Vivi gets their attention, and asks what she should do. She is still uncertain whether to stay or go. Nami says they will get their ship and sail to the Eastern Harbor. If Vivi is not there by Noon, they will consider her to be staying, and leave without her. It is at that point that the Straw Hats take their leave. Vivi notes she can leave for the Eastern Harbor at 8am and make it on time if she chooses; the question is, whether to be a pirate or a princess? She asks Karoo what he would like to do.
Bon Kurei greets the Straw Hats as they arrive at the Going Merry. Luffy is leery of Bon's help, since he lied earlier about helping them. But there's no longer a point to Bon for them to be enemies since Baroque Works is history. He says he took the Going Merry to keep it from being captured by the Marines, and alerts them that they have blocked all the ports. Luffy accepts him as a friend, but Zoro thinks Bon's just doing it because he's just as trapped by the Marines as they are. He admits that this is the case, and Bon Kurei's ship appears shortly thereafter to assist.
That morning, the Marines find the ship, and Hina prepares to enter the battle.","Tony Tony Chopper, Dr. Ho, Nefertari Vivi, Karoo, Monkey D.

Episode 129,Everything Began That Day! Vivi Tells of her Adventures!,20-Oct-02,Vivi decides to stay behind in Alubarna and the Straw Hats indicate that they still consider Vivi a friend while Bon Kurei helps the Straw Hats escape Hina the Black Cage.,"Igaram, overcome by his worry of Vivi joining the Straw Hats pirate crew, dreamed that she declared wanting to be the pirate queen. Upon awakening, he went right away to Vivi's room. Vivi was in her room getting dressed for her speech with the help of Terracotta and Terracotta sent him out. Igaram and Chaka are then seen discussing about the battle between the Straw Hats and the marines ongoing at the harbor and lamenting that they unfortunately cannot help the crew.
The Marines and the Straw Hats have begun battle and the Marines are attempting to sink the Going Merry, leaving the crew in a pinch. Luffy recognized Jango and questioned why he was a marine with Jango answering that he has his own reasons. Sanji, on the other hand, commented that the man next to Jango appeared familiar. Fullbody commented that Sanji and his crew will meet their doom on that day since he's powered up. Usopp went to the cannon launcher and launched a cannon at Jango which destroyed the ship he was on as well as the ship Fullbody was on. Luffy then praised Usopp's marksmanship, saying it was awesome. Bon Kurei told them to escape after those two ships were destroyed and received word that Hina the Black Cage had arrived. He explained that Black Cage Hina is the Marine Headquarters captain that patrolled that area. Bon Kurei questioned why the Straw Hats would not escape and Nami told him about the promise they made with Luffy adding that it was so they could meet a friend.
Cobra and Igaram visit Vivi and she announced she would like to tell them something very important. With his disguise ability, Bon Kurei fooled the marines into pursuing him, allowing the Straw Hats to escape. Bon Kurei recited his Okama Way poem and prepared to engage the marines in battle. Upon witnessing what was unfolding between Bon Kurei's crew and the marines, the Straw Hats cried and swore never to forget them. A flashback as to how Igaram and Vivi found out the instigator in the country's unrest was visited. Another crew of marine ships attacked the Straw Hats again but were overwhelmed. Vivi began her speech which was secretly about her travel with the Straw Hats. On hearing the speech, Zoro and Sanji told Luffy that they had to leave since it appeared Vivi was not coming. Moreover, they were under attack again by another crew of marine ships. The country's people who came to watch Vivi give her speech realized Igaram's attempt to disguise as Vivi and yelled for him to step down.
Vivi made it to the harbor and found the Straw Hat crew waiting as promised. Vivi told them she came to say good-bye and she would be staying behind. She however, asked, if they ever meet again, would they consider her as part of their family? Luffy was about to give her a verbal answer when Nami shut him up. She told him the Marines have seen Vivi and responding verbally would make them consider her as part of them; thus making her into a criminal. So, to give a silent answer and goodbye, the Straw Hats rose their left arm with the cross mark on it as proof that they consider her one of them. Vivi and Karoo also rose their left arm at the shore, indicating their friendship.","Igaram, Maidy, Nefertari Vivi, Terracotta, Nefertari Cobra, Chaka, Monkey D.

Episode 130,Beware Her Scent! The Seventh One is Nico Robin!,27-Oct-02,"The Marines fail again to catch the Straw Hat Pirates. After escaping from the Marines, Nico Robin (Miss All Sunday) appears from inside of the Straw Hat Pirates' ship. She manages to persuade the crew to let her join because Luffy did not let her die back then. Pell is seen at the end standing over his own grave.","Hina explains to Smoker that they sunk Bon Kurei's ship and captured his crew, but the Straw Hats managed to run away. Although, Hina observes that Smoker seems pleased that they managed to escape. King Cobra continues the speech given to the kingdom started by Vivi. Chaka mourns Pell's death at his grave, though he admits that he cannot accept Pell is really gone. Back at Yuba, Toto continues to laugh since hearing the kingdom-wide speech, as he is one of the few people who know the true extent of the Straw Hats' involvement in saving Arabasta. It then cuts to various people and animals who interacted with the Straw Hats through their journey in the desert. Among them are citizens' reactions and plans for the future. Crocodile's casino will probably be shut down as people do not have time to take care of it, neither would they want to. It is then revealed that Pell survived the blast.
The Marines continue to attack the Going Merry and it seems to be sinking. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji decide they've got to fight them when they trip over large metal pipes Usopp kept—which they then decide to throw out. Luffy throws them all off the ship, and they end up striking the Marine ships, disabling them. Using this to their advantage they make a quick escape. After hearing of the escape, Smoker informs Tashigi of the bounties on Luffy and Zoro, informing her of the latter's exploits at Whisky Peak and his victory over Daz Bonez in Arabasta. He assures her they will get their rematch another time as Tashigi vows to defeat Zoro.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats bemoan the loss of Vivi except Zoro who says if they miss her so much they may as well have forced her to come along. The others insult him (except Luffy who does not know how to make up a proper insult). Suddenly the door to the captain's cabin opens revealing Nico Robin. Everyone who knows who she is panics. Robin says Luffy did something to her and Sanji immediately gets angry at him. Luffy has no idea what she's talking about, but Robin insists that he put her through ""excruciating treatment"" and that he needs to take responsibility by allowing her to become part of their crew.
Flashback to the temple collapse, as Luffy lay unconscious. Robin gives King Cobra the antidote to Crocodile's poison, telling him Luffy could survive the collapse due to his rubber body. She admits that she did lie to Crocodile about the Poneglyph and never had any intention of handing over a weapon to him: the Poneglyph's inscriptions actually are about Pluton, but she told Crocodile that they only list the monarchs of Alabasta. As Cobra administers the medicine, she tells him the truth: all she wants to know is the True History through the Rio Poneglyph. But now, she's given up. She's spent 20 years looking for it, and Arabasta was her last good lead. At that point, she believed there were simply too many enemies in the path to achieving her dream. Luffy then wakes and saves Cobra and Robin, even though she tells him to just leave her to die, but he ignores her resolutely: ""Why do I have to listen to you?""
Back in the present, Robin says that she now has nowhere else to go and that Luffy's ""crime"" was forcing her to live when she wished to die. Luffy allows her on the crew without another word, shocking the others. He says she is no longer a threat to them. As she allows Luffy and Chopper to play with her powers Usopp attempts to interrogate her but fails rather miserably and ends up terrified of her. However, Nico Robin reveals something about her past: she is an archaeologist since the age of eight, but she also did a lot of other jobs, including killing. Nami is bribed by jewels and gems into accepting her and Sanji was gone from the word go since she's a woman. Meanwhile Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper are having too much fun playing games with her. The only one who stays suspicious is Zoro, but even he is briefly disarmed by her cheerfulness.

Episode 131,The First Patient! Anecdote of the Rumble Ball,3-Nov-02,"After their adventures in Arabasta, the Straw Hat Pirates come across a pineapple-shaped island and split up tasks amongst themselves. Chopper is left in charge of guarding the ship, and he reminisces about the day he first made the rumble ball and his first patient, Dr. Kureha, while spending some time with the newest crew member: Nico Robin.","The scene opens on an early dawn, where all of the Straw Hat Pirates are asleep. Nami, who is above deck, wakes up and discovers an island in the distance. She calls out to the others, and after a humorous fight between Zoro and Sanji, Luffy awakens and climbs up onto the deck, sees the island, and gives a howl of joy.
Upon landing on the island, Sanji notices that it's abundant with fruit. He suggests that they gather fruit as surplus, therefore, Nami has the remaining crew draw straws to see who gets to stay behind and watch the Going Merry. Luffy takes three, thinking that would make him smarter (which it did not), and in the end, Chopper ended up drawing the longest straw, so he got to stay behind. And so, Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp go to gather fruit while Nami goes to survey the island and draw a map of it, and Sanji follows her, swooning.
Thinking he's all alone on the ship, Chopper decides to play captain, giving out pretend orders to his fellow crew members. For a while, he has fun doing it until he discovers that the newest member of the crew, Nico Robin, was below him the whole time, reading a book. Chopper immediately gets freaked out remembering she was once a Baroque Works Officer Agent and that her specialty is assassination. He tells her he does not trust her and runs off into the ship (though Robin didn't seem to be paying attention). Once inside the ship, Chopper forgets about Robin for a bit and decides to make more Rumble Balls. While he does so, Robin enters and begins to make more coffee, though Chopper does not notice. Instead, he remembers the first time he made a Rumble Ball.
A flashback occurs to before Chopper met the Straw Hat Pirates, back to when Chopper was still learning medicine. He was experimenting with some of Dr. Kureha's medicine until he heard her coming and accidentally dropped a few of them in. Acting quickly, but not exactly thinking, he pressed the ingredients together and tossed the ball in his mouth and swallowed it. His body then went under an unusual change as his arms suddenly became muscular and grew larger without him doing so on his own.
The flashback ends and Chopper begins to wonder how Dr. Kureha is doing. Then he finally noticed Robin was in the room the whole time and panics again. Thinking she was trying to learn the Rumble Ball's secrets and assassinate him he quickly eats a Rumble Ball and attacks breaking a barrel of water. He changes back into his Brain Point form and uses his Scope move to try to find Robin's weakness. Robin just laughs and uses her Devil Fruit power to tickle Chopper. She also says he's funny and cute to which Chopper insults her while doing a happy little dance. Then Robin hands him an empty barrel saying that since he broke the other barrel he should refill this barrel with more water. Chopper agrees and heads off into the island.
Meanwhile, Luffy goofs around with monkeys and Usopp acts as though he was dying trying to gather fruit for this crewmates, making a dramatic scene. Zoro, while grumbling about being ordered by a woman (especially Nami), does what he is told and gathers lots of fruit by cutting them down from trees using his Three Sword Style. Nami, in the meantime, is busy surveying the island as Sanji showers her with compliments and expresses his love. Nami says he's in the way, and knocks him out of the way.
We then go back to Chopper, who, along with Robin go to gather water. When Chopper wonders why she came along she simply says it has been a while since she has gone for a walk like this. They finally reach a lake on the island and Chopper proceeds to fill the barrel. Robin sits in a nearby field of flowers. Chopper asks if she was really wanted by the Marines and all alone ever since she was 8, to which Robin replies ""Yes"". She goes on to say she survived by working for various pirates. She then asks Chopper about the person he was talking about before. Chopper describes Dr. Kureha as ""a woman who dresses like a pirate who is a doctor"".
He starts by saying he has spent 6 years learning how to be a doctor from her. In another flashback he is seen yet again messing with medicine when Dr. Kureha shows up. She asks if he's finished reading the pages he was supposed to read but Chopper complains, asking when he is going to do stuff doctors actually do. He then goes on to say he's already memorized all 200 of the books she gave him. Then suddenly, Dr. Kureha collapses. Chopper runs over to her, asking what's wrong. Dr. Kureha mentions that she might have gotten sick from one of her patients. She then says that he will have to treat her as a test and if he fails, she will die.
Chopper immediately puts her to bed and runs some tests. After checking several books and mixing medicine, he gives her a green sphere-shaped ball which Dr. Kureha takes. Chopper wonders if she's going to ask what's in it and she explains that there is no patient who has room in his/her heart to ask such a question; illnesses cannot be cured unless the patient completely trusts their doctor. She then eats the medicine. Chopper asks if she's any better, but Dr. Kureha says medicine does not work that fast and that she needs her rest. Later that night when Chopper was about to go out to get more water Dr. Kureha tells him he did a good job for someone like him.
Back in the present, Chopper continues to say that was the only compliment he had gotten from Dr. Kureha in all those 6 years. So instead of acknowledging him as a doctor, she trusted him with her life; that's the kind of person Dr. Kureha is. Then Chopper realizes he's said too much but Robin had already gotten up and was ready to head back for the ship. Before she goes she tells Chopper she wishes she had someone to write to like he did. They went back together with Chopper carrying a full barrel of water (still in Brain Point).
Later that night all the Straw Hats were eating the fruit Zoro gathered. Nami was disappointed with Luffy and Usopp, but congratulated Zoro on a job well done and said he'd get to collect fruit through the night. Sanji swooned but Zoro tells him to shut up. Before they got into a fight Nami holds them both back saying she was just kidding. While everyone laughs Luffy asked how Chopper's day was. Chopper said nothing special happened, then looks over at Robin, reading her book, and then added, ""...But it's been a great day!""","Nami, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 132,The Navigator's Mutiny! For an Unwavering Dream!,10-Nov-02,"Luffy fishes a weird salesman out of the water and onto the Going Merry. He tries to sell his inventory to the Straw Hat Pirates, and Nami obtains a ton of ""1000 year paper"" from him to draw her sea maps. However, she is repeatedly interrupted by her crewmates' antics.","Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper are fishing off the side of the boat while the rest of the crew relaxes. Chopper catches a large fish, and Usopp catches a small one. Sanji offers Nami some tropical juice that he says will make her skin smooth, and Luffy and the others ask for some, too, as they want to look cuter. Luffy keeps fishing and pulls out a large sea snail, and the crew discuss whether or not to cook it. Before they can, a hatch on the side of the snail's shell opens and a man comes out. He introduces himself as Rice Rice, a traveling salesman from the Den-Den Company who was lost in a storm during a delivery. He thanks them by offering them free product catalogs. While he was explaining his trade to most of the crew, Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper wander into his Escar and begin playing with his inventory. He interrupts them and takes the Buru Buru Blade from Luffy, explaining its different features and apparent value. When he sees Chopper playing with the Ab-Ab Slider he does the same, claiming that both were his company’s “Number 1” product. He then straps Usopp into the Golden Fish, much to Usopp’s dismay, to demonstrate its functions and then offers the three products, Mero Mero Juice, a stack of encyclopedias, and binoculars for 23,800.
As the crew thumbed through the catalogs, Sanji noticed the company’s knife collection. Rice Rice pitched him a super flexible knife from High Mountain and then offered him a dozen table knife set, scissors, a peeling knife, and an electric sharpener for 2,980. He tried to pitch his Silky Smooth Skin Soap to Robin,and she commented on his company’s vast inventory. Luffy asked him if they sold live animals and when Rice Rice told him they did not, the captain was disappointed.
Nami asked if he sold paper strong enough to resist weathering. Rice Rice revealed his Millennium Paper, explaining its qualities and possible uses. When Luffy asked if it could be used to make paper airplanes, Rice Rice annoyedly said that doing so would be a waste. Recognizing Nami’s strong desire for the paper, he tried to cheat her and drive up the paper’s price. He offers it to her for a “reduced rate” of 48 million and she asks if he could take it down further. When he offers to sell it for 47.5 million she countered offered with 2 million. Though Rice Rice drops back to a 4.8 million offer, Sanji said they would pay for it. He ties up Luffy and proposes they turn him into the Marines and Rice Rice realizes that he was the notorious pirate Monkey D. Luffy. As he trembles in fear he notices the crew’s jolly roger and falls to the ship’s deck, nervously cowering. He quickly jumps to his feet and makes an excuse that he had an appointment to get to, climbs into his Escar and flees the ship in haste.
With Rice Rice gone the crew notices that he has left the inventory he was showing them, including the Millennium Paper Nami wanted. She takes it into her room telling her crewmates to keep quiet and watch the clouds for any weather changes. She decides to start making her dream of drawing a map of the world a reality, settling down to draw Little Garden, Drum Island, and Arabasta. She recalls standing on a cliff in Cocoyasi Village with Bell-mère and Nojiko, asking her mom where the wind and sea come from. Bell-mère answers, laughing and patting her daughter's head. Nami then recalls when she returned to that spot after stealing books from a shop in her village and her mom came up to bring her home for dinner. Nami asks her mom about what is past the sea, to which Bell-mère responds saying that she did not know past the Grand Line. She then told her mom her resolve to travel the world and make a map of everywhere she goes.
Back outside, Sanji orders Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper to clean the ship's deck. Zoro argues that Robin should help instead of relaxing with her book but Sanji defends her. Zoro and Sanji begin to fight over this causing the ship's deck to shake. With the rumble, Nami's ink pen slides across the paper while she is mid-stroke. Aggravated, she comes out of her room and hits both of them over the head telling everyone to be quiet. She returns to her drawing and starts a new draft.
Back outside, Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper try cleaning the ship by riding on the Ab-Ab Slider with a mop. They use the Silky Smooth Skin Soap and make sudsy bubbles which cover the entire deck. Nami comes out when she hears them laughing loudly and is surprised by the bubbles. Getting carried away, Luffy falls off the Ab-Ab Slider and overboard. He grabs the figurehead to prevent himself from falling into the sea but he launches himself straight into Nami's room knocking all of her map-making supplies to the floor in a crash. Furious, she demands they all stay quiet or else she would charge them all 100,000. Luffy tries to apologize, but she pushes them all out. Chopper is both scared and saddened by Nami's frustration.
Nami returns to her map-making and everyone except Chopper falls asleep on the ship's deck. He notices the clouds change and a tornado appears before them. Terrified, he tries to tell Nami but recalls her threat. Unsure what to do he sits on the ship's deck in fear. Nami finishes her first map and exits her room to find Chopper crying about the tornado and not being able to tell her. She reassures him that everything will be alright and wakes up the crew. They all jump to raise the sails and steer the ship, except Robin, who continues to read in the rain. After they pass the storm Nami tells everyone about her first map and reaffirms her dream to chart the whole sea. Robin finishes reading and closes her book and the crew lowers the sails to continue onward.","Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 133,Inherited Recipe! Sanji the Curry Iron Chef,17-Nov-02,"The Going Merry runs into several Marine Ships in some fog, and the Straw Hat Pirates meet a trainee Marine chef named Tajio. Sanji helps him out of a bit of cooking trouble.","Luffy sits at the head of the Going Merry while Usopp uses his goggles on top of the ship trying to see through the fog. A ship appears in front of them and he realizes it belongs to the Marines, causing him to become uneasy. More of them start popping up and Nami suggests that the Marines are probably having a hard time seeing through the fog as well, with Robin agreeing and saying that there is probably nothing to worry about. Sanji then spots a child standing on one of the Marine ships and the child gets startled by seeing the pirate's flag, to which he passes out and falls overboard. Sanji begins to jump to save the child but Robin insists that she should save him using her devil fruit powers to reach the boy and bring him to safety. The boy, startled by seeing the strangers, says that they are probably planning on attacking the Marines. Luffy declines the accusation and Sanji brings some soup out for the boy. The boy accepts after a moment of observation and happily enjoys it, then he introduces himself as Taijo, one of the probationary cooks for the Marines.
Prior to falling off of the boat, Taijo explains that recently he was carrying a pot full of soup when he tripped over a broom and spilled it. He apologized to the Chef who told him to make another one if he truly meant it. Taijo agreed but he wasn't able to make it very good and Nami asks him if he has any experience. He answers her by saying that it has only been six months since he started as a probationary cook. Sanji says that it is long enough for him to have learned something. Taijo disagrees and reveals that this entire time he has only been washing dishes and peeling some items, he's never made actual food yet. He then adds that the soup wasn't being prepared for any ordinary lunch, but a special lunch consisting of all Marine Captains. Sanji tells him to just apologize again, but Taijo reveals that if he doesn't make a new soup he will be kicked off of the ship. Luffy asks why he can't just cook on land and Nami asks if this particular ship means anything. The boy smiles and asks if any of them have heard of the All Blue, which interests Sanji as the boy explains what he knows about it to them.
After Nami says that he should head back to his ship, Sanji offers to help him out, then he asks Luffy to lend them a hand in returning to the ship. Luffy stretches his arms as Nami questions Sanji about helping and he explains that he just wants to check out the Gally on the Marine Ship. They hold onto Luffy and like a sling shot he shoots them towards the ship; but when he decides to join them Sanji angrily asks for an explanation. Luffy responds by asking Sanji how he planned on returning to the ship without him. Taijo then shows Sanji where the Gally is and Sanji takes note of how expensive everything looks. Suddenly, hearing a noise nearby, Taijo approaches the pantry to find Luffy making himself comfortable with the various items and when Sanji asks him what he was doing, he lies and claims that he was exploring. Before he can leave Sanji forces him to empty his pockets. He then begins to tell Taijo about his time when he was younger, back when he had the same job as him. His chef told him that he will never learn anything by doing the chores all the time and this makes Taijo realize that the Chef didn't teach him not because he didn't want to, but because he wanted him to learn through observation. Taijo recalls that the Chef was making curry and he starts to remember the steps to make it.
Meanwhile, Luffy admires the huge ship's mast, touching it until he hears two Marines approaching. To avoid detection he pulls himself to the very top and hangs from it until they pass.
Taijo is able to slowly remember everything the Chef did to prepare the curry and he slowly makes some, having Sanji try it. Sanji gives critique and reminds him that cooking cannot be rushed, which makes Taijo remember the Chef explaining the process to him with fine detail. He tries to use this to improve the curry, but Sanji spots another mistake, and he assists him with some advice.
It's then Luffy gets spotted by a Marine that is on lookout.
With a little more help, Taijo prepares the curry perfectly and he thanks Sanji as they spot Luffy currently being chased. He stretches out his arms and prepares to leave as Sanji tells Taijo that he thinks the Great All Blue is out there too, then he holds onto Luffy allowing them to escape before the Marines can arrive. Taijo smiles as the Marines approach to ask if he saw anyone suspicious. He claims he didn't and suggests that the fog might have been playing tricks on their eyes.
Luffy and Sanji are back with the Crew and Nami gets mad that Luffy got caught by the Marines as this could have gotten them into trouble. Usopp angrily chews him out for damaging the Going Merry and reminds him that they need to be more careful with it.","Sanji, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 134,I'll Make it Bloom! Manly Usopp's Eight-Shaku Ball,24-Nov-02,The crew stops on Fireworks Island that is getting ready for its annual fireworks festival. Usopp meets a young fireworks-maker named Kodama and helps her achieve her dream.,"The Straw Hats arrive at Fireworks Island just in time for its annual fireworks festival. The locals explain that the tradition of the festival has been going on for 400 years and is carried on by a family who lives on top of the mountain on the island, although now it is just an old man and his granddaughter. This reminds Usopp that they need gunpowder, so he sets off to the mountain to get some from the old man.
Usopp reaches the mountain and is immediately sent away by the old man, Odama, since the latter has no time for a “novice firework maker” like him, especially on the day of the festival. Usopp tries to convince him by showing Odama a firework of his own making but is instead stunned at the humongous firework inside the old man’s home.
Kodama arrives and inspects Usopp’s firework and compliments it and encourages Usopp to “finish it.”
Meanwhile, Odama admonishes Kodama for wasting time and sends her off to finish her tasks for the festival. He then orders Usopp to help Kodama, which Usopp reluctantly does after the young girl asks him to help.
The two bond and Kodama once again compliments Usopp’s firework and tells him to “finish it.” She explains that any firework is considered unfinished until it blossoms beautifully in the night sky. Usopp then mentions the huge firework he saw earlier and how he would like to see it go off. Kodama explains that a year ago, they tried to fire a similarly huge firework, but the equipment was flawed and there was an accident which killed both of her parents.
Suddenly, the rain starts again, and Kodama mentions that the party cannot proceed if it continues to rain. Nonetheless, Odama tells them to continue with the preparations.
Kodama tells Usopp that if the weather allows it, she plans on launching the huge firework at the night of the festival. This flusters Usopp as he thinks she cannot launch such a big firework by herself. She assures him that the launch team will help her setup the firework but she will fire it up by herself so everyone else will be safe. She says that their family used to have the technical skills to make and launch 200-gauge shells but somewhere along the way they lost these skills and that it was her parents’ dream to revive the tradition and bring back those skills. She then asks Usopp to distract her grandfather while she and the launch team carry the shell away.
However, Odama finds out about Kodama’s plan from the launch team and forbids his granddaughter from launching the shell. Kodama runs away and Odama tells everyone else to prepare for the festival.
Usopp notices something about the tower in the old man’s home and asks him if it has been there for 400 years. He then says that he has a hunch that he wants to share with him.
Usopp then finds Kodama in the cemetery where her parents are buried. Usopp makes her realize that her parents’ dream is not just about launching a 200-gauge shell, but that she is their dream. Their dream is that she carries on the family tradition and becomes a master pyrotechnist. He tells her that while it would be great to bring back their old family tradition, her parents just want her to be safe and sound.
The rain suddenly stops and this gets the girl’s spirits up. The festival proceeds and fireworks are displayed in the night sky. Odama then reveals that Usopp was able to devise a pulley system to haul the 200-gauge shell towards the tower in the old man’s home. Furthermore, it is revealed that the said tower is actually a 400-year-old launch platform of their family’s 200-gauge shells. Usopp and Odama prepare to launch the shell after all the other fireworks have been ignited. As Kodama fires her last one, Usopp “finishes” his firework and then has Odama light up the 200-gauge shell which blossoms throughout the island in a gigantic finish.
Kodama sees this and is even more inspired to become a great pyrotechnist. Usopp uses this opportunity to ask for some gunpowder once again and Odama at first says no as Usopp could be a pirate for all he knows, but he then relents.","Monkey D.

Episode 135,"Infamous Pirate Hunter! The Wandering Swordsman, Zoro!",1-Dec-02,Zoro has a flashback about the time when he first met Johnny and Yosaku and faced off against the Dick Bandits along with their leader Dick.,"The episode begins on an island where a very exhausted Zoro wanders around.
A group of pirates are seen laughing at a bar named W Brothers. The head of the table is a bandit named Billy, who proclaims he will ""drink this bar dry"" with the other pirates questioning him. Yosaku notices Billy and finds out his 5,000,000 bounty. Johnny is shown to be very reluctant and tells Yosaku, who tries to counter Johnny saying that they can't just take the small guys forever. However, Johnny is still persistent not wanting to risk instant death. 
Just then, Zoro enters the pub very exhausted and sits down wanting food. The owner tells Zoro off since he has no money to pay. Zoro however says he'll pay once he ""collects the bounty from the guy sitting behind me."" Billy, very angry to hear this, gets up and charges at Zoro. Zoro quickly opens his katana slightly and counters the sword. Zoro, very hungry, asks about Billy's bounty and Billy confirms the 5,000,000 on his head. With the information given Zoro quickly finishes him off in the chest. He now has the money he needs to eat.
Johnny and Yosaku, very frightened from the ordeal, question if the stranger is the ""Infamous Pirate Hunter guy"" describing him as the 3-sword wielding demon that took the form as a human. Quickly brushing off the rumors they approach Zoro asking him to follow the Bounty Hunter rules and hand over the dead body of Billy because they spotted him first. Zoro ignores, making Johnny annoyed in the process.
Zoro then stops and asks them if they've heard of Hawk Eyes Mihawk. They answer in approval and Zoro explains to them that he is searching for Mihawk so he can defeat him and become the ""Greatest Swordsman"" in the world. He then clarifies he claims bounties only in order to eat, therefore he is no ""bounty hunter"". Yosaku scoffs at Zoro calling his goal an impossible task. Zoro ignores those comments saying he already made up his mind because it was his ""childhood dream"" and nobody can ever change his mind. This comment leaves Johnny in shock. Zoro gets up and apologizes for his intrusion on ""taking their bounty"" and lets them have it. Of course, if they pay the bill for his meal.
After turning in the bounty, Yosaku is seen to be very happy as they now get to lay off the bounty hunting for awhile and be able to eat more nicely. Johnny, still remembering his conversation with the stranger, asks Yosaku ""Why he became a Bounty Hunter."" Yosaku, confused, answers back, ""To Eat."" But Johnny explains to him that he became a Bounty Hunter because he yearned to be like the brave Hunters that protected his poor village from the pirates that attacked it. His talk with the stranger made him remember about his own childhood dream. Yosaku laughs it off saying it's not like him.
Suddenly, the villagers in the town are running in fear closing the windows and running away. One of the villagers tell him that the infamous Dick Bandits are attacking the storage at the edge of town. Yosaku scrolls through the papers and find out he has a bounty of 10,000,000. 
At the edge of town, Dick breaks open the storage facilities with his massive Pistol and his group of bandits loot the goods. Johnny and Yosaku arrive at the scene with all the frightened villagers. All the villagers are too afraid to reclaim the stolen goods fearing their death. As the Bandits empty the storage Dick becomes very arrogant proclaiming only idiots try to oppose his mighty self. Suddenly he gets hit by a hammer. A boy named Harry tries to attack Dick but to no avail. However the boy won't give up. This makes Johnny reminiscent of his childhood and convinces Yosaku to go on the offense. They charge at Dick, now face to face with him. 
Dick shows no fear to the duo. Saying they aren't worth his time and would rather pay them to buzz off. Johnny proclaims he would rather fight for justice. This makes the Bandits laugh. Johnny pleads for Yosaku to fight with him. Yosaku, with a sense of bravery, agrees to the offer. Yosaku then brags how they turned in the 5,000,000 bounty over to the Marines. This causes Dick to stop laughing and get angry at them since it turns out Billy was Dick's younger brother.
Meanwhile, as the fight begins in the distance, we pan to Zoro walking up the steps to a swordsmith. He walks up to the sweating man and asks if his Meitou has been repaired. He compliments the swordsman for his impressive workmanship. The swordsmith adds on saying it wasn't very easy as Zoro handles his Katanas way too hard and the other two katanas he used are shown to be shattered. He then has a flashback to the time he challenged and fought Kuina. Zoro offers to repay the swordsmith but is denied as it's not everyday you get to see such a beautiful sword. Zoro hands back the long sword, that he had used prior to kill Billy, but the sword shatters right in front of the swordsmith. He scoffs saying Zoro would break every katana he touches. Zoro, with regret, promises to pay him back somehow. As this happens a huge gunshot can be heard. Zoro is informed that the Bandit Mountain Whale Dick has arrived and has a 10,000,000 bounty on him. Zoro is then showing relief as how he can pay the swordsmith back. 
Cutting back to the fight, Harry, the little boy, watches in horror as the duo try to fight Dick to no avail as he keeps knocking them back before they could reach him. Even still they get back up to charge at him with determination. Dick questions how they could have taken out his little brother. They reply that they only turned him in. The two bounty hunters charge back one more time, for being called weak, before being knocked out to the ground very weak and worn out. Harry gets mad and charges only to get hit. Dick's crew reports back saying they loaded everything onto the cart. Dick, now out of patience, declares he's had enough with such ""weak punks."" Johnny and Yosaku gets back up as Johnny proclaims that he would risk his life to prevent the Bandits from getting away. This leaves an impact on Harry. Dick, running out of patience, asks his crew to finish them off. Harry is knocked away by one of the bandits landing in front of Zoro's feet. The bandits then beat up Johnny and Yosaku. Harry gets back up but is stopped by Zoro. He tells Harry to think of what he can do before attacking. 
As Johnny and Yosaku are badly hurt and thrown to the ground Dick tells them that they had bad luck and he earned nothing from this fight. One of the Bandits picks up a sword and charges to kill them but is interrupted by Zoro's blade. Johnny and Yosaku recognize Zoro and he asks if it's okay to take their bounty again as he needs the money, with them approving. Zoro then ties his bandana on his head as Dick slowly recognizes him. The two also recognize the katana with a white scabbard (Wado Ichimonji). Zoro asks Johnny and Yosaku if he can borrow their katanas. They slowly agree and realize Zoro's identity. Dick doubts Zoro would be able to take out his men even using three swords. Zoro points out there is a difference between ""using three swords"" and ""practicing three sword style"". As the Bandits charge at Zoro he swiftly defeats all of them at once. Zoro looks back at the bodies only to have Dick charge at him from behind and pull the trigger.
As the bang happens, we finally cut back to the present to where a big mountain gets blown to bits with Usopp firing next to everyone on board. Zoro comes back to his senses sneezing. As he sneezes, Robin comes in with a jacket. Due to being suspicious of her, Zoro grabs tightly to his Wado Ichimonji, guarding it. He reminds Robin that she can't stand beside him. She tries saying that he'll catch a cold. Zoro declines saying people who catch colds have weak hearts. Robin then reminds him of the Pirate Hunter Zoro name. He then tells her he never called himself that. Robin asks who gave him that name. He replies saying he doesn't know and it has nothing to do with him. Another cannon fire is heard as Robin walks back to reading The Rainbow Mist book.
We then cut back to when Dick fires at Zoro with Harry flying in with a Water Bucket, cancelling the gunshot. Zoro uses the opportunity to slash Dick. Zoro examines the borrowed katanas and is relieved they aren't broken. He thanks Harry for helping him. After the commotion both Johnny and Yosaku are in awe of Zoro and ask him to join forces with them. Zoro shrugs and tells them why not. Johnny and Yosaku celebrate.","Roronoa Zoro, Billy (flashback), Yosaku (flashback), Johnny (flashback), Dareda (flashback, wanted poster), Dick (flashback), Harry (flashback), Kuina (flashback), Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 136,Zenny of Goat Island and the Pirate Ship in the Mountains!,8-Dec-02,"After escaping from several Marine ships, the Straw Hat Pirates land on an uncharted island and meet an old man named Zenny. Chopper finds out that, because of his bad heart, Zenny probably only has three days to live.","The Straw Hat Pirates are being chased by the Marines and are trying to avoid them, as they are constantly firing cannonballs towards their ship. With the Straw Hat Pirates being low on food supplies, they are all starving, wondering if they are going to starve to death. A huge fog appears, which Nami believes can be used to their advantage to escape from the Marines. The Marine ships starts crashing into each other as they are hitting the barely visible rocks on the surface which just appeared after the fog. Chief Petty Officer Minchey orders his men to turn back because of the danger for the Marines. As the Straw Hat Pirates pass the thick fog and the rocks they see an uncharted island, hoping to find food on it. An old man is sighted with his binocular, counting the Straw Hat Pirates as six humans and an animal.
As the Straw Hat Pirates walk up from the shore, they spot a young goat, directly clarifying it as food. As they try to hunt it down, Nami stops them, stating that it shouldn't be eaten. Suddenly, a mob of angry full-grown goats have surrounded the Straw Hat Pirates. When the goats start attacking, Zoro brings out his sword, indicating that he will kill them but Chopper tells him not to due to the fact that they aren't bad, thanks to his ability to speak with animals. Chopper is trying to reason with the goats and finds out that someone ordered the goats to attack. Suddenly, an old man falls out of a tree pointing out the now transformed Chopper as a monster. They found out that this is the man who ordered the goats to attack.
The old man passes out, from the fear of being cut by Zoro's blade as he is trying to free him from the branches that he has gotten stuck in. They take him to his shed, where Chopper is getting him treated. As the old man is craving them to repay him for what they have done, Luffy finally says to help him out. On Zoro's hunt for food he finds a strange pirate ship, which he later in the evening tells the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates about after he returned with fruits as food. They all go to the ship to investigate it further. Nami states that he was once a pirate who is trying to escape the island with that pirate ship, which is more of a wreck than a ship. She also believes he has a hidden treasure somewhere on the island.
Meanwhile, at Marine Captain Moore's base, Captain Moore tells Minchey to organize a landing party and to locate and eliminate the Straw Hat Pirates. On the island, Chopper find out that the old man has less than three days to live, due to a disease. Therefore, the next day, Sanji is making him a big dinner because of the few days he has left so that he can enjoy his last moments. At the Marine Base, they find out that the old man's name is Zenny and that he was washed ashore on the island 20 years ago with his believed huge treasure.","Minchey, Nami, Usopp, Monkey D.

Episode 137,How's That for Profit? Money Lender Zenny's Ambition!,15-Dec-02,"The Straw Hat Pirates help Zenny out, hoping to make his last days good ones. They learn about Zenny's past as a money lender and his dream of becoming a pirate, but Zoro realizes that Zenny has outlived Chopper's predictions. The Straw Hats decide that after helping him finish his pirate ship, they will leave the island.","The Straw Hat Pirates are busy repairing the wrecked ship and Zoro is busy chopping down trees by axe. The chopped wood is then being passed on by goats to each other towards Chopper. While carrying the chopped wood, Zenny makes exclamations about the slow work of the Straw Hat crew. To calm him, Nami makes Zenny sit on a chair and Robin offers a shoulder massage. Sanji asks him about why the ship is on the top of the mountain to which he says that this ship is his coffin. The Straw Hats are astonished and ask him if it is too early to have a coffin. He replies by saying he will be needing a coffin anyway eventually. Sanji asks him why his coffin is a pirate ship and Zenny starts dozing off, but the Straw Hat Pirates think that he has died and start shouting to which Nami points them to be quiet as he is only dozing off.
At a Marine base, Marines learn that both the Straw Hats and Zenny are at the same island. Keeping in mind the bounties of Luffy and Zoro, Sergeant Minchey suggests a plan to assure victory.
At the island, Zenny is playing chess with Nami and he is getting all the services from massages to delicious cheese. Luffy, Usopp, and Zoro return with caught fish for dinner and assure Zenny of any services he asks for. Zenny exclaims how he is living a paradise. Zoro thinks about it and says that he should have died by now as three days have already passed. The Straw Hats think of leaving the island as Zenny seems in better health than when they arrived.
Nami keeps on losing to Zenny in chess and in the hope of getting details about the treasure, she bets everything including the ship. Consequently, they owe him service for 10 more years to get their ship back. Usopp suggests bolting out but Luffy refuses, saying a bet is a promise and he will not break any promises. During all the ruckus going on about leaving, Robin checkmates Zenny and wins the ship back. Being delighted on meeting such joyful prates, Zenny decides to have a party.
At the party, Nami tries to get the old man drunk to learn about the true location of the treasure to which he jokes about the goats being his real treasure. Later, he says he was a money lender to pirates and was known as the money lender Zenny. This revelation came as a surprise to Usopp as pirates don't usually return the money they take. He talks about how the pirates were not returning the loaned money, so he always went face to face with them to get his money back.
Recalling his past, Zenny was on a ship and was asking for his money back or else he would sink the ship by bombing it.
After talking about his past, he talks about his dream of becoming the Pirate King and how his ship got destroyed by pirates 20 years ago causing him to drift to this island. He thought of building a ship but wasn't able to bring the wood beside the sea, so he built his ship on the mountains. By the time he had completed the ship, he had gotten too old to sail the Grand Line. However, Luffy suggests that no one is too old to become the Pirate King.
The Marines are on their way and are thinking of luring the Straw Hat Pirates out of the island while Zenny is thinking about what Luffy said to him.
When morning comes, Chopper exclaims about seeing the Marine ship and the Straw Hats start running to the shore and are confronted by Sergeant Minchey. He says he came with only one ship just to inspect the island and Zenny and the Straw Hat Pirates should leave immediately as other Marines might come for them. In reality, a huge Marine fleet is hiding in the fog behind them so that they can attack the pirates when they leave. The Straw Hats easily look through this trick and get ready to attack but are stopped as Usopp is captured and are asked to drop their weapons. They do as they are told, and the Marines now try to shoot at them and at the same time, Zenny unloads his ship from the mountain top.","Usopp, Roronoa Zoro, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Zenny, Nami, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

He helps the Straw Hat Pirates out of trouble with the Marines, and then they part ways.","Zenny spots a fleet of Marine ships and realizes that a trap has been set up against the Straw Hats. Zenny decides to “sail down” the mountain using his ship to help them. Zenny sees that he is now at sea and he declares that he has officially become a pirate.
While the Marines are distracted, the Straw Hats head towards the Going Merry. A Marine sees this and asks Minchey to inform their captain that the pirates are up to something. Minchey shoots at him and reminds him they cannot tell their captain what’s going on if they wanted to steal the old man’s treasure.
Zenny realizes that the chief petty officer has been paying off his men so they can go on his side projects and mocks him. He challenges him that if he wanted his treasure, he would have to take it himself. Zenny then sends his goats to attack the Marine ship and chaos ensues.
The chaos proves to be too much for Zenny and he experiences chest pains. Minchey kicks him and grills him about the treasure’s location. Zenny confesses that he is broke and that he has no treasure. Minchey doesn’t believe him and decides to just search the whole island instead of waiting for the old man to tell him the treasure’s location.
Before Minchey can kill Zenny, Robin throws an abacus at Minchey and the goats trample him. The Going Merry reaches Zenny and Chopper rushes to give him medical attention. With Minchey captured and everybody safe, Nami asks Zenny about his treasure. Zenny reveals that he exchanged all his treasure for cash. He was attacked by pirates and ended up marooned on the island. When he came to, the goats had eaten all his cash and left him with nothing which is why he considers the goats his treasure.
They then send Minchey flying back to the Marine fleet. Moore strips him of his rank and calls him a disgrace. He then calls Luffy and tells him that he has no interest in capturing Zenny. And that while he wants to capture the Straw Hats, he also wants to pay a debt of honor for delivering up a disgraced member of his fleet. He allows them to choose where they will fight. Luffy accepts and heads out to meet the Marine fleet. He then unintentionally leads the fleet to a foggy reef area which causes the Marine ships to sink.
Zenny goes back to the island to repair his ship and decides to sail off to sea after the repairs. The Straw Hats have set up Zenny’s supplies and medicine so he will be able to head out when he is ready. Zenny decides that his age will not stop him from becoming a pirate and that he will go on adventures so long as he is able to.
As the crew worry about him, Luffy assures them that the old timer will be fine and Zoro agrees as he thinks while Zenny did have a weak heart, he had plenty of guts to make up for it.","Zenny, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Nami, Sanji, Monkey D. Luffy, Roronoa Zoro, Minchey, Moore, Nico Robin",

Robin explains that here beyond the Rainbow Mist is a land of eternity with untold treasures where all of its inhabitants never age. Luffy brings a chest full of treasure on board the Merry and tells everyone there’s a lot more on the shipwrecks. A mysterious voice threatens the crew with a curse of the dead if they do not return the treasure and leave right away. Ghosts then suddenly appear and an arrow is shot almost hitting Zoro. Luffy attacks the ghosts finding it is actually children trying to scare off any intruders. A boy named Rapanui announces they are The Pumpkin Pirates and demand the Straw Hats leave or else he will set off a bomb. Henzo recognizes Rapanui and the rest of the children and explains who he is, they’re very old friends. Trying to prove himself, Henzo sets off the bomb Rapanui is holding stating that it is just the ""Ka-boom Mark 3"", an invention of Henzo's that only tricks an opponent. Rapanui sets off a smoke screen and all the children disappear.
As a flashback, Henzo explains to everyone how years ago (as a child himself) the Pumpkin Pirates dreamed of becoming real pirates and tells of a time when their town of Ruluka was attacked and set on fire by The Wetton Pirates. The children flee the town by stealing the Pirates’ ship as Captain Wetton and his crewmate Ian chase them. As the children fight off Wetton and Ian, Wetton and Henzo fall overboard and the rest of the children sail directly into the Rainbow Mist never again returning.

Back in the town of Ruluka, Sanji continues to fight Lake, the grandson of the town’s mayor Wetton, over not paying the towns Harbor Taxes. A coin hits Lake in the head knocking him over. He asks Sanji if he was the one that threw the coin at him so Sanji, Nami, and Chopper decide to lie and say it was. Lake picks up the coin and takes that as a payment for the tax to dock their ship in the towns harbor and formally welcomes them to the town. They proceed to the harbor looking for the rest of the crew. Lake tells them that The Going Merry was last seen heading towards Ape’s Concert beyond a strange mist in the ocean where a ship graveyard is. He tells them that the mayor has announced all the shipwrecks there have untouched cargo just laying around with jewels and coins and tells them Henzo is employed by the government to research how to safely enter Ape’s Concert. Nami tells Sanji and Chopper they need to go inside it to find their friends and hopefully the treasure. Mayor Wetton then walks up and punishes Lake for saying too much and tells them no one is allowed inside the Rainbow Mist without his permission.","Monkey D.

When all of them swam very quickly, Henzo was left behind trying to tell them to wait. Rapanui Pasqua turned back and shouted he can't because he is an adult. Henzo's body suddenly turned to the present old appearance he has and the background went hallucinating until Henzo woke up and realized it was all just a dream. Nico Robin saw him awake and figured out that he was dreaming about his friends because he was shouting their names while asleep.
Meanwhile, Luffy and the others are on the outside and Zoro asked Luffy if they are travelling in the right direction. They soon realized they once again passed a statue that they already passed a while ago, they thought they were travelling in circles but in shooting a cannon made all of them realize the space was distorted. Luffy obviously didn't know what it meant so he dared to test it by flying forward to the sky and then came falling back from behind the ship. Luffy told them he gets it and said that it was a ""Mystery Mist"", obviously not understanding it himself. None of the crew knew how to get out of Ape's Concert, so Robin suggested to ask a boy hiding behind some wreckage, how they might get out by going to the Pumpkin Pirates hideout.
In a Marine ship wreckage, Ian is seen eating in a prison cell with Rongo and Akibi talking to him about how to get out of Ape's Concert as well. Ian tries to convince them that he knows how to get out of Ape's Concert but they should give him the key to his cell first. Isoka knew he was lying and reminded the two how cruel he was to them by forcing them to let him be their leader when previously a Sea King was attacking them he was so afraid that he threw Rongo to fight it. Nearly eaten, Rongo was rescued by Rapanui and after the attack, Ian boasts that they wouldn't be alive if it weren't for him. Their ship got lost because the Sea King smelled the food they kept and they were left on a small boat. In the Marine ship, the buzzer rang and Isoka asked Rapanui what's the danger. Rapanui saw a pirate ship and managed to see Pukau thinking he is being held hostage.
Rapanui immediately went to rescue him and threatened Luffy and the others by swaying his sword until Zoro threw it out. Pukau told Rapanui that he was not a hostage and that they just asked him where their secret hideout is. Rapanui wouldn't believe when Usopp went out holding plates of food attracting both Luffy and Pukau until all of them except Rapanui started eating. In an attempt to offer food, Henzo was denied by Rapanui because he doesn't believe in adults who suddenly appear. Henzo asked for forgiveness because he worked hard to find them but now they are of different ages. Henzo's Den Den Mushi started ringing but Luffy grabbed it and answered it receiving Wetton's voice. On the other side, Sanji grabbed the Den Den Mushi from Wetton and asked if it was Luffy. Upon discovering they talked to each other, Henzo knew the Rainbow Mist and the Outside World wass connected.
Henzo got the phone back and when Rapanui heard Wetton's name he told Henzo that he was not the true Henzo they knew. He said that true Pumpkin Pirates don't work for Wetton. When Nami, Chopper and Sanji decided to go to the Rainbow Mist, Wetton forbid it and said they must pay 10,000,000 beli to be able to be permitted. They didn't want to pay so Wetton told them they would instead work hard labor in the Rainbow tower until their deaths. Nami asked for the safety device and Lake, gullible enough, gave it up and they started running. While Sanji wished that it would be a romantic getaway, Nami's desire for the treasures made her eyes turn into Beli symbol. The 2 prepared to fight when suddenly a Sea King appeared before them and Nami  screamed ""What?"" ending the episode.","Akibi, Isoka, Rongo, Pukau, Rapanui Pasqua, Henzo, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

Ian wakes up and discovered that someone was coming to bring them back to Ruluka . Ian, surprised, suddenly told them to wait and cried infront of Akibi telling him to let him out. Gullible enough, Akibi agreed and Ian thanked him followed by an evil laugh. Meanwhile, Luffy again propelled himself to the sky followed by Rapanui pushing Henzo still not convinced that he was the real Henzo even if the others told him it was a mistake and that Henzo would never be Wetton’s dog. Rapanui reminded them of Wetton’s burning of their village and asked Henzo if he forgot those memories in just 50 years. Usopp attempted to convince him by telling him he didn’t know what happened to those 50 years and how Henzo suffered in order to save them. He told them that he endured those many backstabs that he experienced but still researched on the Rainbow Mist.
Henzo puts it aside and told Rapanui to punch him and forget about all the pride because he has been living under Wetton’s command. Rapanui couldn’t punch him and instead cried wondering how 50 years could have passed so suddenly, Usopp told them they are comrades as to reuniting the Pumpkin Pirates. When they were about to shake hands, Luffy suddenly appeared from a portal and grabbed Rapanui and went inside another portal. Nico Robin told them they will be fine because everything in the Rainbow Mist is in a loop but quickly disagreed because it took too long. Henzo told them they should find them and the scene went into a different dimension in which Luffy and Rapanui went. On the other side, a Sea King continues to threaten Nami and Sanji told Wetton they should help her before she gets eaten but Wetton didn’t care. Lake recognized they couldn’t get to Ape’s Concert either because of the Sea King. Flip told her she should use the safety device Henzo invented which is a lifeline but she was too scared at that moment as she was going to be eaten. A Marine Major knocked it out with a coin and then fades away. Nami tied the end of the line to her Clima Tact and she threw the cross portion to Chopper and went into the Mist telling him to pull the line if a signal is given. Wetton said to let her go and the guards shouted he will now change clothes. He changed into his Flame Suit in about just a second. The guards prepared for the suit’s requirements but the weakness is obvious because of the shaking in raising the flamethrower of the suit. On the other side, Luffy and Rapanui are running not knowing where to go and Rapanui sat because Luffy was just running because of his instinct. He said he didn’t complete his reuniting with Henzo. He was worried that he might be like his Pop when he grows up, he was a Marine Officer and he left him years ago only to discover that his father died. Luffy still wanted to get back so he started walking telling Rapanui they wouldn’t find the others without moving. They couldn’t find them so Henzo thought they might have come to the Mist’s end. Robin was wondering a bit because a shipwreck she estimated was about 200 years old and a rocket debris floating saying she didn’t see that recently, she concluded that the Rainbow Mist’s time is actually distorted. Nami arrived with some treasures on her rowboat and asked where Luffy was. Usopp and Zoro told her they were gone with Nami surprised. Ian came out with Akibi as hostage but Nami didn’t want to save him because she didn’t know who he was. This led to Isoka threatening her with a knife and Ian with the two of them went in the rowboat. Isoka aggravated Ian but Akibi got kicked in the waters. Robin held Ian tight with her devil fruit powers and Isoka went to rescue Akibi but Robin got weak because of Kairouseki. Ian escaped and Usopp can’t concentrate on shooting him. Meanwhile, Chopper and Sanji are in trouble of being burnt from Wetton forcing Chopper to eat a Rumble Ball but still failed because of Lake. Sanji got caught on a net and got burnt too. When they saw the signal, they did see a rowboat coming back as Sanji was about to kick Wetton when Lake electrocuted him. Ian saw Ruluka Island and was amazed but mistook Lake to be Wetton. Ian was surprised again for discovering that Wetton had already entered third generation and Wetton secretly whispered what was in the Mist. In the Mist, Nami is appreciating the treasures but considered them useless if they can’t get out. Henzo knew they would come back because Wetton wants to get all the treasures of Ape’s Concert. Usopp told Nami she was a navigator so she should do something. Rapanui and Luffy are already tired of walking when Rapanui fell and remembered how they worked hard on getting out the Mist. Ironically, Rapanui wanted to go back to Ruluka even if he told them they would own Ape’s Concert as their paradise. 
Rapanui saw a Marine ship and someone waving looks like his father but the sight turned to a light which they ran to. On the other side, the Rainbow Tower was knocked down and the water that splashed came to Luffy and Rapanui too. The tower then went straight to the Mist horizontally. The sea inside the Mist got rough and then Henzo saw the Rainbow tower. Rapanui and Luffy got back to Ruluka and Rapanui concluded that they are invading Ape’s Concert. The entrance of the tower in the Mist opened and the guards arrived from the other side by the tower’s tunnel-like conveyor belt. Wetton told the guards to get all Ape’s Concert’s treasures laughing evilly ending the episode.","Ian, Rongo, Pukau, Monkey D.

Episode 144,"The Log is Taken! Salvage King, Masira!",9-Feb-03,"Nami's Log Pose begins to point to the sky, after that, a big ship falls from sky and the crew finds a map of an island named 'Skypiea' on a 200-year-old ship. Meanwhile, Masira and his crew appear to salvage the ship and think the Straw Hat Pirates are trying to steal their salvage. Nami thinks that it would be easier for them if Masira's salvage crew salvages the ship for them. Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro continue to search the ship for clues while the salvage crew works to bring up the wreck. Eventually a giant sea turtle appears and eats the entire wreckage with everyone inside.","The Straw Hat Pirates notice some debris falling from the sky, initially thinking it was rain. Suddenly, an entire wrecked ship falls from the sky causing huge waves rocking the Going Merry after almost hitting it. When the seas have calmed down the Crew tries to figure out how a ship could fall from the sky. Nami then notices that her log pose is pointing towards the sky, thinking that it is broken. Robin suggests that the log pose isn't broken but is merely registering an island with strong magnetic pull further suggesting that it must be pointing towards Sky Island.
The Straw Hats are both in disbelief and excitement. Robin explains that Sky Island isn't exactly just an island in a sky, but rather, an entire ocean. Luffy tells them to set their course towards Sky Island but Sanji points out that they can't actually fly. Robin goes on to admit that her knowledge about the island is based solely on word of mouth and that she has never actually seen it. Nami thinks that the whole thing is made up and insists that their log pose is simply broken. Robin then argues that instead of trying to fix something that isn't broken, they should try to find a way to get to Sky Island. She further says that in the Grand Line, one must not doubt their log pose no matter how crazy things get, stating that this is the most steadfast, unbreakable rule in the Grand Line.
Robin proceeds to study the skull of one of the sailors from the ship that just fell from the sky while Luffy and Usopp investigate the wreckage. After piecing together the skull, Robin sees that it has been punctured from an ancient medical procedure called craterization and deduces that the man must have been dead for at least 200 years. She further deduces that the ship must be St. Briss, an exploration ship from the South Blue.
Meanwhile, as the ship is sinking, Luffy starts drowning. After being pulled up, he announces that he found a map of Skypiea within the wreckage. Nami inspects the map and remains skeptical since it could be a fake treasure map, further pointing out that even if it were real, the map doesn't show them how to get to the Sky Island. In order to get more information on how to get to Sky Island, Nami proposes that they salvage the ship that has now sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy volunteer to go, using special barrels attached to the Merry designed by Usopp which allows them to breathe underwater.
While the trio is descending towards the shipwreck, a pirate ship arrives to where the ship has sunk. The captain of the ship introduces himself as Masira, Captain of the Masira Pirates and declares that the sunken ship is now the property of the King of All Salvagers. He orders his crew to raise the ship. Masira notices the presence of the Straw Hats and warns them about stealing ""his ship"" since, according to him, all ships that sink in the area are his property. The Straw Hats decide not to tell Masira that they have already sent a team to the shipwreck and also decide not to stop him from raising the ship. Nami uses her charms to avoid suspicion from Masira and he starts to try to impress her.
As Masira's crew is setting the cradle to raise the sunken ship, they ascend beaten up and unable to talk. However, Masira still does not suspect The Straw Hats. Underwater, Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji have made it to the wreckage and start to explore, during which time, Masira is able to set the cradle and starts raising the ship. The St. Briss starts to fill up with air and ascends but the Masira Pirates start to encounter problems caused by Luffy's group. Masira decides to investigate this himself and swims under. He finds the trio inside and asks them what they were doing in his territory. Instead of answering, Luffy simply states that he (Masira) looks like a monkey, which Masira takes as a compliment thereby losing aggression towards the group. While they are exchanging pleasantries, a gigantic turtle suddenly eats the St. Briss and surfaces beside the Going Merry.","Monkey D.

Episode 145,Monsters Appear! Don't Touch the Whitebeard Pirates,16-Feb-03,"The Straw Hat Pirates decide to go to Jaya to look for information about Skypiea. Meanwhile, Ace hitches a ride with Buggy, who demonstrates his own objection to any confrontation with Whitebeard.","A turtle-like Sea King surfaces near Nami and the crew. The Masira Pirates are also frightened and scream for their captain, who is underwater confronting Luffy. Robin finds that the air hoses of the crew's diving suit were in the monster's mouth and deduces that Luffy, Sanji and Zoro were eaten by the monster. The monster pulls the Going Merry via its air hoses and tries to pull it underwater and Nami was about to cut the hoses to free the ship but the sky suddenly changes to night.
The Masira Pirates fear that the sudden change of the time of day was a bad omen, and that they should reel their captain in immediately. Luffy surfaces unconscious, and Zoro and Sanji both surface soon later. They all suggest to set sail and leave immediately, but Masira hops on their ship and prevents them from leaving. However, one of the Masira Pirates points out that, to the horror of the Straw Hat Pirates, the sudden night was caused by giangantic creatures blocking the sun. The Straw Hat Pirates flee.
Later, Masira is seen briefly on the Going Merry before the Straw Hat Pirates kick him off. Nami is disappointed that Luffy, Zoro and Sanji did not find any clues about Skypiea during the salvage. Sanji points out that the ship looked as if it were attacked, or it had been destroyed by battle. Then, Robin reveals that she had taken an Eternal Pose from the Masira Pirates for an island called Jaya. So, Luffy commands his crew to turn the ship to Jaya to ask others about Skypiea. They soon realize, however, that they cannot stay in Jaya for too long or else the Log Pose will adapt and point elsewhere and they will lose their chance at finding the Sky Island.
Meanwhile, Mohji and Cabaji are on an island resembling a skull. They are searching for the treasure of Captain John. However, they fail to find any treasure. Back on the ship, Buggy reveals a plan that involves waiting for Luffy to gain a reputation on the Grand Line so Buggy can receive a greater reputation by defeating him.
Portgas D. Ace appears on Buggy's ship, intimidating Cabaji. Ace suddenly falls asleep and Mohji suggests taking Ace out while he is asleep, but Buggy refuses to harm Ace out of fear of what Ace's boss, Whitebeard, would do in retaliation. Ace wakes up soon and starts a party on Buggy's ship. Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates continue traveling towards Jaya.","Nami, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

Episode 146,"Stop Dreaming! The City of Ridicule, Mock Town!",23-Feb-03,"Jaya's main town is full of infamous pirates that are constantly brawling with each other. Luffy and Zoro have a run-in with a pirate known as 'Bellamy the Hyena', who ridicules their dreams and beats them up. Luffy and Zoro do not fight back, because they had no reason to fight as Bellamy was not in their way.","In a bar, Roshio and Bellamy are gambling and Roshio wins. However, Bellamy refuses to accept defeat and insists that Roshio cheated by having Sarquiss bear false witness. Roshio tries to fight Bellamy but he is defeated easily. The Straw Hats were still at sea and trying to locate Jaya when Chopper commented about the Seagulls flying above; then suddenly the Seagulls fall and Chopper states they were shot. Usopp comments that only an extraordinary marksman would be able to have shot them and it is more likely that the shots were random. Van Augur, siting on a roof somewhere in Jaya, is revealed to have shot the birds and comments on their fate.
Meanwhile at Mock Town, Jesus Burgess is seen challenging a man to a fight and he defeats his opponent. One of the onlookers comments to him that the man he defeated is one of Roshio's men, judging by the mark on his head band. Meanwhile at the bar, two men are discussing how Roshio was defeated, with the false excuse that he cheated, and one of them recognizes the man who had defeated Roshio to be Bellamy.
The Straw Hats finally arrive at Mock Town. Luffy and Zoro left the ship and Nami accompanied them after considering that they would cause trouble which will get them kicked out of the town. Such a turn of events would disrupt their information gathering for the Sky Island. To avoid that, she made them promise that they would not start a fight with anyone. While on their way, Doc Q fell in their path and asked for assistance in getting up. Luffy and Zoro got him on his horse, Stronger. He thanked them saying he was born with a weak body and brought out a basket of apples and asked them to choose one. Zoro indicated that it was suspicious. However, Luffy went ahead and helped himself to one apple. Shortly after Luffy took a bite of the apple, an explosion erupted nearby because some people had eaten apples with explosives. Doc Q then stated that Luffy is a lucky man for choosing the apple that is a dud. On the ship, Chopper, Usopp and Sanji notice that Robin also left, without them realizing it.
Still trying to inquire information, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami went past Jesus Burgess who is growling, standing on the roof of a building. The people comment that he's got many victims without a bounty on his head and it is best to stay away from the wrestling champion. On hearing this, Luffy and Zoro become competitive but Nami squashed the competitive fuel in them to avoid a fight. They reach Tropical Hotel with the intention of gathering information. However, Spector, the hotel manager, refuses them because the Bellamy Party has rented the entire place and no other customers are allowed. This reveals Spector's fear of Bellamy.
Sarquiss returns at the hotel and upon seeing Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, he comments that they are shabby-looking kids. Luffy asks if he should kick Sarquiss's butt but Nami and Spector yell ""no"". Sarquiss throws some money at them saying they should use that to buy themselves some clothes. Luffy gets excited and he is ready to take the money when Nami drags him away. They reach a restaurant and Nami is complaining about the town when the bartender tells her that since many rich pirates come to Mock Town to unload their wealth, brawls and murder occur frequently. While conversing with Nami, Luffy, and Blackbeard comment on the cherry pie and the drink. They have opposite opinions on the food and they are close to starting a fight because of this. Blackbeard asks if Luffy is a pirate and Luffy replies that he is. He then asks for Luffy's bounty and when he learns that it is 30,000,000, he disbelieves it. He left the bar somewhat disappointed.
Bellamy and his crew come into the store and Bellamy inquires if this is Straw Hat Luffy with the 30,000,000 bounty. He buys Luffy a drink which Luffy accepts saying Bellamy is a good guy. While Luffy is having his drink, Bellamy smashes Luffy's head into the bar table. Immediately, Zoro and Luffy get ready to fight. Nami tells them to stop and asks the bartender if he has any information regarding the Sky Island. People in the bar are dumbfounded and break into laughter. To her defense, Nami says that the log pose points upwards but the people continue to laugh saying the log pose is broken. Bellamy says that they should not believe the cock-and-bull story about an island in the Sky and that only ignorant sailors ride the knock-up stream only to fall back down. He says all dreams could be explained and the age where pirates dreamed is over. He also mocks the people who die while chasing their dreams and he says that they give him an upset stomach. Luffy who had his fist clenched, releases it when he hears Bellamy's statement and even goes as far as allowing Bellamy to punch him. Nami tells Luffy and Zoro to forget about the promise and fight Bellamy and his crew. Luffy then tells Zoro that they are not going to fight them.","Bellamy, Roshio, Sarquiss, Usopp, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

The two of them along with Nami then meet a man outside the bar who told them that Sky Island does exist. They leave Mock Town, and get into a fight with Masira's brother Shoujou, another salvage monkey.","It opens in the bar where Bellamy is still hitting Luffy and Zoro and the bar customers are laughing saying the town is not for dream loving pirates like Luffy and his crew. Nami is angry that Luffy and Zoro are not fighting back since they could easily defeat those guys. After much beating, Bellamy ordered someone get Luffy and Zoro from his sight stating they are eyesores. They were kicked out of the bar. Sarquiss offered to buy Nami stating that she would not survive the new era with those guys. Nami responded saying she is too good to join a team of pansies like Bellamy's crew. They responded laughing and saying the crew is full of weaklings. Nami grabbed Luffy and was walking down the street when someone yelled out saying Sky Island exists. Nami recognized Blackbeard and he told her that Luffy and Zoro won the fight and her tongue lashing was impressive as well. He said the new era Bellamy talks about is rubbish. He went on saying that people's dreams never end and if Luffy seeks the Summit, he would find fights that fists alone would not take him to. Blackbeard left saying he hopes Luffy finds Sky Island.
Returning to the ship, the rest of the Straw Hat crew inquired as to why Luffy and Zoro look so beat up. Nami still very angry at what occurred at the bar asked why they could not fight back. Zoro stated that she had mentioned something earlier about that and Nami, still angry, said it was in the past. Chopper asked if they found anything related to the Sky Island and Nami stated she does not care about that anymore and just mentioning about Sky Island made the whole bar mock her. Robin returned and gave Luffy a map stating that a man was outcast for talking about his dreams.
On their way to find the man, they came across Shoujou. Luffy voiced that Shoujou looked weird and the Shoujou pirates took offense to that however, Shoujou brushed it off. Shoujou went ahead and told Luffy that a Warlord named Crocodile has been kicked off and he (Shoujou) is awaiting his invitation to join the Warlords of the Sea. Luffy told Shoujou to move aside because they had a place to go. Shoujou became upset and said that this area was his territory and if they want to pass by, they have to pay the toll fee. On hearing that, Usopp recognized that Masira had said the same thing. Shoujou heard Masira's name and asked what about Masira. Luffy responded saying they sort off kicked him but he is probably alive. Shoujou got very angry and began to use his Havoc Sonar. However, doing this, Shoujou was destroying his ship as well as the Straw Hats'. The Straw Hats fled from the reach of his voice.
Meanwhile, back at the bar, a customer was talking about how a beautiful and strong woman was inquiring about Mont Blanc Cricket. Another responded saying that sea territory belonged to the Saruyama brother but Cricket is known to have acquired a new gold treasure. On hearing this, Bellamy asked where the man was located and would like to meet him. He demanded to be told more.","Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Cricket is a descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, an infamous ""liar"" who told of a gold city on Jaya and Cricket was ostracized for looking for artifacts of the gold city. He may be the only person who knows how to get to Skypiea. The episode ends with Mihawk looking at Zoro's and Luffy's new bounties.","Usopp tries repairing the damages from the sonar attack but the crew keeps talking about replacing the ship. Usopp gets mad, asking them if they remember how they got the ship in the first place. Luffy tells Usopp not to complain and that the ship is part of the crew and that it needs to be fixed. That was before he hit a hole in the ship, making Usopp angry again. Nami looks at the map explaining that they are headed east by circling the island on their way to visit Mont Blanc Cricket. Luffy and Usopp are shocked to see a huge carnival palace looking house. However, it's revealed that the magnificent looking palace is just a cutout with a much smaller house behind it. Nami asks why he was outcast, and Robin explains that it might have something to do with him suggesting finding gold. Nami is thrilled by the idea of finding gold and puts Chopper to work by digging around. Luffy goes into the house to find no one there. Nami finds a very old children's book titled ""Noland the Liar"" from the North Blue. Usopp likes the title and Sanji reveals that he is from the North Blue but grew up in the East Blue, stating how the book is famous in the North. He also says that the book was based on a man who existed a long time ago. 
Story: 400 years ago, there lived a man named Mont Blanc Noland who lived in a North Blue country. As an explorer, he talked about his adventures even though the villagers couldn't decide whether to believe him or not. One day, he reported to the king after his travels and told him that he found a mountain of gold on an island in the middle of the sea. The king set sail to see if the story was true, taking 2,000 soldiers and Noland. After harsh waves and battling monsters, only the King, Noland, and 100 soldiers remained. But all that was on the island was a jungle. The king sentenced Noland to death for lying, with his last words being ""The mountain of gold must have sank into the sea!"", but no one believed him. 
Back at the pub, the pirates are laughing at the fact that Mont Blanc Cricket is a descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, saying that he must not be right in the head if he wants to clear his 400-year ancestors name by finding a few pieces of gold. Back with the Straw Hats, Luffy sees bubbles coming from the water, but is disappointed when nothing happens. Nami teases Usopp by saying that Noland died before he became ""a great warrior of the sea"". Luffy is suddenly dragged into the sea as a large man with little blond hair and a ""Maroon"" tattoo jumps out of the water. Sanji runs towards the mysterious fellow while telling Usopp to get Luffy out of the water. The man, who we believe to be Mont Blanc Cricket, shoots Sanji in the face, but it actually missed. Just as Zoro is about to enter the fight, the Cricket drops his pistol and falls to the ground. Usopp gets Luffy up to the surface while he explains what happened. The crew takes the man into his house while Chopper doctors him up. Chopper explains that he has Caisson Disease, which is something divers get, but it's not long-lasting, however it can become fatal if the person exerts themself too much. In the background there is a picture of the man and the two monkey pirate brothers smiling.
The two monkey brothers, both in good health, come bursting into the home asking if the ""old-timer"" is ok. Usopp and Chopper freak out when the brothers ask what they're doing to him, but Luffy says they are taking of care of him and that they should leave. The brothers are glad that the Straw Hats are nice. The brothers reveal that the house is the headquarters of the Saruyama Alliance. Cricket comes to and apologizes for assuming they were after the gold. Luffy asks him about Sky Island but gets laughed at instead. He explains that no one knows for sure if it's there, except for the man everyone calls a liar. Luffy keeps looking at Usopp, but he says that it's not him. It's revealed that Cricket is indeed a Mont Blanc descendant, and that Noland was actually an extremely honest person who was very sad that the people didn't believe him. Usopp guesses that he was diving to find the gold and clear his ancestors name, but he shoots at him, missing of course, and explains that what his ancestor did has nothing to do with him and because of him he had a rough childhood. But over the past 400 years, many relatives have tried to clear the Mont Blanc name but have disappeared instead. So Cricket ran away from home and became a pirate to escape Noland's reputation. He managed to get his own ship and crew and entered the grand line. However, they accidentally came across an island, which is the one they are on now. He believed that it was fate, that he, who hated the Mont Blanc name so much, would find the island his ancestor had found long ago. He decided to search for the gold, but his crew decided to leave instead of helping him search. Rather than feel obligated to find the gold, Cricket thinks of it as a duel between the man who made his life hell and himself. Usopp bawls and Luffy asks how the monkeys fit into the picture. Turns out, the monkeys love the picture book and believe the gold really exists. Luffy presses the man about sky island, yelling that he wants to go there. Cricket says that it's not confirmed that Noland ever went there but tosses Nami Noland's log book from 400 years ago. Nami reads about his adventure and how they saw skyfish. The gang gets really excited to hear Nami read about Sky Island. Cricket goes outside to see the Monkey Brothers fighting and convinces them to help the Straw Hats get to Sky Island.

Episode 149,Hard Turn to the Clouds! Find the Southbird!,23-Mar-03,"Cricket explains how the Straw Hat Pirates can ride a dangerous vertical current called the Knock Up Stream to get to Skypiea. However, they first have to catch a South Bird to point them towards the point where the stream will erupt from the ocean.","Mont Blanc Cricket explains to the Straw Hat Pirates that the sudden night they witnessed earlier was the result of a dense cloud and that the location of Skypiea was directly above this cloud. Cricket then explains that in theory, a ship can ride on the Knock Up Stream to reach Skypiea. However, if they fail to find a place to land there, they will fall back to earth. According to Cricket's prediction, the next Knock-up Stream will occur the next day. The Straw Hat Pirates go back inside to eat. Meanwhile, the Bellamy Pirates approach Cricket's home for gold.
Cricket continues reading Noland's logbook. Noland writes that he heard a bell upon reaching Sky Island. Cricket then shows three bell-shaped gold ingots he found while diving, proving that there was civilization there and also a golden sculpture of a southbird. He then explains that the Straw Hat Pirates will need to capture a southbird from the forest, because they always face south, so the pirates can use the southbird as a sort of compass to navigate to the Knock Up Stream.
So, while Cricket, Masira and Shoujou make repairs and improvements to the Going Merry, the Straw Hat Pirates split up into groups and venture into the forest to find a southbird. Sanji, Usopp and Nami end up in an area full of tarantulas, while Zoro gets stuck in a quagmire and Luffy and Chopper manage to find a southbird but it drops a bee's nest near Luffy, causing several insects to chase them away.

When the Straw Hat Pirates return and see what happened, Luffy decides to take a side trip back to Mock Town and take the gold back.","The Straw Hats are still attempting to capture the South Bird. However, the bird has waged an offensive against them by turning the forest against them. Meanwhile, Bellamy and his crew arrived at Cricket's place in order to take his gold treasures. Sarquiss and the rest of them were easily defeated by the Saruyama Alliance then Bellamy decided to join in the fight. Bellamy easily defeated Cricket, Shoujou, and Masira using his Bane Bane no Mi powers. Their gold was stolen and Bellamy's crew finished it off with more offensive against the Saruyama Alliance because Cricket had said they do not have the right to touch the gold. Bellamy on his way back to his ship went on to say that in the new era they need to understand that dreams do not come true. Cricket then told him that ""a chick who does not have the guts to fight against something he's never seen shouldn't be telling me about pirates.""
The Straw Hats have gathered together after being chased by various animals set up by the South Birds. The bird finally came to meet them and Tony Tony Chopper interpreted the bird saying they would never catch him. As Usopp was about the shoot the bird down, Robin captured the bird with her Hana Hana no Mi. Upon returning to Cricket's house, the Straw Hats found that they have been beaten up. Usopp was mourning how their ship has been damaged. Luffy tried asking Cricket what had happened but Cricket refused to tell him and only apologized saying there was nothing they could do—referring to their easy defeat. At that point, Nami told Luffy that the gold has been stolen. Cricket stated it does not matter the gold is stolen. Usopp chastised him saying Cricket had spent 10 years beating his body through diving so as to attain the gold.
Cricket was persuading them saying that the Saruyama Alliance have a duty and that was to get the Straw Hats to the Sky Island. While talking, Zoro noticed Bellamy's mark on the Going Merry's hull and called Luffy's attention to it. Luffy then resolved to fight them and Zoro asked if he needed a hand and Luffy said no that he would be fine. Nami said that Luffy shouldn't go because they have only 3 hours left to set sail. Cricket tried to stop him by talking but Zoro offered him a katana saying Cricket would need that to stop Luffy. Luffy then told them that he would be back by dawn.
A drunk customer after relieving himself thought a newspaper had dropped. He picked it up and realized it was a stack of wanted posters. Upon going through the posters he recognized Luffy's and Zoro's faces and laughed when he saw their bounties thinking he was too drunk. He became extremely surprised that their bounties were so high to the point of being higher than Bellamy's bounty.
Luffy had begun making his way to Mock Town. Meanwhile, Sarquiss was telling of the event that occurred between their crew and the Saruyama Alliance. Soon the drunk man who picked up the wanted posters came into the bar and showed it to all who were in the bar including Bellamy. Bellamy tried to counter the poster saying there are pirates who try to increase their bounties and their opponents become scared and would not fight them. He referred to Luffy and Zoro's event where he beat them up earlier in the day. While the bar customers were trying to justify the situation, Luffy arrived and yelled Bellamy's name requesting his whereabouts.","Monkey D.

After their last encounter in Mock Town, he doubts Luffy even knows how to throw a punch. Sarquiss still believes the bounty poster for Luffy with his new 100,000,000 bounty is a fake. He questions if the old one for 30,000,000 is also real as he watches Luffy's fight with Bellamy. Bellamy breaks off the roof they are on and springs at Luffy with Spring Snipe, but Luffy jumps out of the way. The Bellamy Pirates sit back to ""watch the show"". Bellamy manages to hit Luffy when he's falling from the rooftops, and smashes him into the boardwalks. Luffy gets up as if nothing has happened, but Bellamy is still unimpressed with his effort.
Wanting to finish it, Bellamy begins springing off all the nearby buildings around Luffy with his Spring Hopper technique, all the while mocking Luffy for being among the pirates who chased dreams. Angered, Luffy cracks his knuckles, recalling Bellamy asking if he even knew how to throw a punch. As Bellamy springs toward him to finish him off, Luffy punches downward, striking Bellamy down through the boardwalks so hard he leaves an imprint of his fist in the now-unconscious pirate's head. Sarquiss urges Bellamy to get up, thinking Bellamy was fooling around. But it turns out the drunkard that found Luffy's new wanted poster was right about Luffy's notoriety. With Bellamy's blood dripping from his fist, Luffy demands Cricket's gold back, and the town's people scatters in a panic after learning Luffy and Zoro's bounties are real.
Back at Cricket's camp, all of his associates are back to work retrofitting the Going Merry thanks to Chopper's care. Nami berates Zoro for not going with Luffy to challenge Bellamy, even though he was beaten up earlier too. He does not take kindly to her insults, and Usopp tries to cool them down as they start beating on the ship in their argument. Back in Mock Town, Luffy sacks up Cricket's gold. With Bellamy still laying in the broken boardwalk, Sarquiss tries to challenge Luffy, but is held back by the others. When asked where he is going, Luffy raises his fist, still covered in Bellamy's blood causing Sarquiss to fall to the ground in fear. Luffy then points upward and tells them, ""The sky!""
Drifting in the ocean, Dracule Mihawk gets Luffy and Zoro's new posters. He is pleased to see that they can now shake the World Government with their defeat of Crocodile.
Meanwhile, at Mary Geoise, the Five Elders—the de facto rulers of the world—find out from a Marine that ""Red Hair"" is trying to get in contact with ""Whitebeard"" via messenger. They determine that the two meeting is too dangerous, and they must find a successor for the defeated Crocodile among the Seven Warlords of the Sea quickly to maintain balance between ""the powers"". They also admit that they cannot keep Luffy unchecked. Indeed, a meeting of the remaining Warlords of the Sea has been ordered. Two arrive: Donquixote Doflamingo and Bartholomew Kuma, both of whom had massive bounties before becoming privateers. When he arrives, Doflamingo toys with two of the present Marines, using his powers to make them fight each other out of sheer boredom. He is told to stand down by the Fleet Admiral of the Marines, Sengoku, who is impressed that even two of the remaining six Warlords of the Sea showed up. Doflamingo said he only came because his ""island business"" was running so well he was bored of it. Shortly after, they are joined by Mihawk, making it three Warlords. He says he was merely an onlooker in these proceedings, as he's interested in the pirates responsible for Crocodile's defeat.
Shortly after, a foreign voice joins in, and the room is invaded by a tall, lanky man with tap shoes. One of the Marines present identifies him as Laffitte, a former peace officer from West Blue who was chased from his country for his cruel methods. He says he is here to recommend someone to replace Crocodile.
Somewhere on the seas, a captain receives a letter from Shanks. His men insult the messenger, Rockstar, a relative newcomer to the Red Hair Pirates who has a 94,000,000 bounty. The intended recipient of the message, Whitebeard, rips up Shanks' letter. The captain appears to be ill, as he has nurses all around and is connected to several IVs and an oxygen line. He tells Rockstar that if Shanks wants to send a message, he should deliver it personally, and bring good booze along with it. Rockstar alerts Shanks by Den Den Mushi. Shanks apologizes for putting Rockstar through all that, and tells his men to get ready to set sail to meet Whitebeard.
At Mary Geoise, Laffitte recommends his captain, Marshall D. Teach, to replace Crocodile as a Warlord. Sengoku does not even know who this pirate is, but Lafitte tells him that his crew, the Blackbeard Pirates, are hatching a plan to make their names known.
In Mock Town, while the citizens were talking about Bellamy's defeat, Teach looks at Luffy's reward poster, and comments on it. Then Sarquiss runs into him and tells him to get out, so Teach buries his head into the ground. Then, he declares that he does not intend to capture weaklings, but one man out of 100,000,000, so he and his companions begin to leave the city, while discussing Laffitte and fate.
Luffy, however, is already on his way to the other side of Jaya with Cricket's gold.","Monkey D.

Ride the Knock-Up Stream,27-Apr-03,"The Going Merry is re-fitted by Masira and Shoujou to be more flight capable, and the Straw Hat Pirates catch a ride on the Knock Up Stream and head to Skypiea.","The Straw Hats are awaiting Luffy's return. Nami is very upset that Luffy is taking too long and that they might miss the Knock-Up Stream. At that moment, Luffy arrives. The Straw Hat crew set out and Cricket tells Luffy that The City of Gold or the Sky Island has not yet proven to be non-existent. He tells Luffy that he may be laughed at; however, that is what romance is about. Cricket then thanks him for returning the gold.
The Blackbeard crew have moved out, and are looking for the Straw Hats to capture Luffy because of his high bounty. Luffy begins to make fun of the South Bird, pointing out that the bird is really uncomfortable when not facing south.
Once at sea, the Dark Cumulonimbus Cloud is spotted and the Straw Hats and Saruyama Alliance make their way towards the cloud. The Straw Hats guide their ship towards the whirlpool so as to ride the knock-up stream. Usopp, Nami. and Chopper begin to lose their nerve as they make their way into the whirlpool and plead with Luffy for them to go back. However, Luffy is far too excited to let them do that. Just as they got to the center of the whirlpool, the currents vanish and Nami explains that the main event is about to occur. While waiting for the knock-up stream, the Blackbeard pirates catch up to the Straw Hats and Blackbeard tells Luffy that he is there to claim his 100,000,000 head. Luffy, unaware of the increase, questions Blackbeard about this, before Blackbeard raises the poster for them to see as well as Zoro's bounty of 60,000,000. Usopp confirms that it was a new bounty poster and informed Luffy and Zoro of their amounts, with Nami deducing that the new bounty must be a result of what occurred at Arabasta. Both Luffy and Zoro are pleased with their high bounties.
Just as the Blackbeard pirates prepared to attack, the Knock-Up Stream erupts and the Straw Hat's ship rides the stream up towards the Cumulonimbus Cloud aided by Nami's exceptional navigation skills. Meanwhile, the Blackbeard pirate's boat is smashed to pieces, leaving them stranded in the ocean.","Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Mont Blanc Cricket, Shoujou, Masira, Usopp, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 153,This is the Sea of the Sky! The Knight of the Sky and Heaven's Gate,4-May-03,"The Straw Hat Pirates arrive in an ocean above the clouds. Usopp almost falls out of the sky but is saved at the last minute. The crew is also attacked by a mysterious looking warrior, but is saved by the Knight of the Sky. Finally, they arrive at the border which transports them to the upper realm, Skypiea.","The Knock Up Stream drives the Going Merry through the Emperonimbus Clouds. Luffy finds it to behave just like water and does his best to hold his breath. Soon the ship breaks the upper surface of the White Sea and its wings break off. Back in the Blue Sea, Cricket sits on the island as the Knock Up Stream dissipates, lost in thought. Floating with his crew on the remains of their raft, Teach is impressed that the Straw Hat Pirates got away. Burgess is angry that they lost out on a possible bounty, but Teach reasons that they will cross paths again if they remain on the Grand Line.
Everyone on the Going Merry is sputtering from their unexpected underwater ride—except for Usopp, who has drowned. Everybody is amazed by the beauty of the clouds and wonders how the ship can float on them. Chopper finds Usopp not breathing and has to give him CPR. Usopp soon comes to and quickly wonders at the White Sea's expanse as well. Nami sees that the Log Pose is still pointing almost straight up. Robin thinks they have to go higher still, but isn't sure how yet. Usopp is eager to take a swim. Sanji warns him not to try until they were certain of the Sea Clouds' properties. Usopp doesn't listen and jumps in quickly ""swimming"" deeper and deeper. Luffy and Chopper at first are jealous, since as Devil Fruit users they cannot swim. But as he fails to come back up, Robin suggests the White Sea has no bottom and he's not swimming but falling. Luffy stretches his arm through the White Sea and Robin uses her Hana Hana no Mi power, Ojos Fleur, to put eyes on Luffy's arms to look for Usopp. They find him as he breaches the bottom of the Emperonimbus Clouds and Robin uses Veinte Fleur to grow arms out to grab him.
Pulling Usopp back up to the ship proves surprisingly difficult. When he breaches the surface, he is followed by a Sky Eel and the tentacles of a Sky Octopus. Zoro slashes the tentacle and to everyone's surprise it bursts like a balloon. Sanji knocks out the Sea Eel and it hangs limp and deflated over the rail of the ship. Zoro comments on how thin the air is while Sanji wonders about the strange creatures. Usopp screams as he feels a Sky Fish wiggling in his overalls then curls up in a fetal position on the deck repeatedly mumbling ""sky island scary"" after the personal horrors he's already experienced. Robin and Nami examine the Sky Fish. Robin wonders about the adaptations of the sea creatures to be able to swim in the Sea Clouds. Luffy then grabs the fish and Sanji sautees it. Luffy finds it delicious. Nami is angry at first that they cooked her specimen until she tastes it too and finds it delicious as well. While they wonder if they can cook the Sky Eel too, Chopper looks for Skypiea in the binoculars. He instead finds a ship getting blown up in the distance and falls to the deck in fright.
Chopper warns that there's something headed this way. A man with a shield and a bazooka-like weapon charges the Going Merry looking to destroy it. The strange person quickly knocks down Zoro, Sanji and Luffy, then jumps up and takes aim. However, he is stopped by a second man who jousts at him from a bird. The first blocks with his shield, but is knocked into the White Sea. The second man boards the Going Merry and reveals himself as the Sky Knight, an old man wearing armor along with his riding bird, Pierre. Nami comments that it was disgraceful that their three best fighters lost so handily. Chopper thanks the Sky Knight who says this rescue was ""on the house"". Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are all winded; Robin thinks it's because of the thin air at their altitude of 7,000 metres. The Sky Knight quickly recognizes the crew as ""Blue Sea people"". He says that there's no way they'll be able to last even higher up in the White White Sea, at 10,000 meters. Luffy thinks he's getting used to it, though.
The Sky Knight says he is a mercenary and offers his help to those who are not used to fighting in the sky. He offers his services for 5,000,000 but the crew is utterly unfamiliar with the Skypiean economy. He is surprised to find that they arrived by the Knock Up Stream and Nami frets over the fact that they had indeed come by an unusual route. The Sky Knight asks if their entire crew arrived alive. He says that usually crews lose a few men on normal routes, but with the Knock Up Stream, it's either they all live or they all die. He sees this as proof that the crew is capable of handling themselves in the sky. For that, he gives them a whistle for free; they can call on his aid, if needed, one more time free of charge. He introduces himself as ""Gan Fall"". Before taking his leave, he shows that Pierre had eaten the Uma Uma no Mi devil fruit, allowing him to turn into a Pegasus. The crew is disappointed that the mythical Pegasus looks so ordinary.
After the encounter, the crew still doesn't know how to get up to the White White Sea. Luffy suggests using the Whistle to ask Gan Fall for directions but Nami and Usopp stop him. Chopper spots a waterfall-shaped cloud, and they sail in that direction. Along the way, they stop among other different kinds of clouds that are floating in the White Sea. For a moment, they find rubbery clouds floating among the ship and Luffy, Usopp and Chopper bounce on them for fun. Nami surmises they will have to find a way around these clouds, so she asks them to find a route. Usopp finds a gate at the base of the waterfall and they navigate around the clouds until they arrive at Heaven's Gate. At this point, Zoro begins to wonder if they actually are dead. Someone emerges and takes photographs. Noting she has wings, they think at first she's an angel, though Luffy is disappointed she's so wrinkly.
She reveals herself as Amazon, the ship inspector at Heaven's Gate, and asks for a toll of 1,000,000,000 per person as dictated by the law. She says they don't have to pay, since she is not a guard and is merely asking their intentions. Luffy says they don't have money, the crew still not knowing what ""extols"" are, and asks how they get up. At this point a giant sky lobster, the ""Express Lobster"", grabs the stubs of the Going Merry's broken wings and begins to swim up the waterfall taking them to Skypiea. As they travel, Amazon calls on ""almighty God"" that a ship is entering Skypiea illegally with 7 occupants and requests that he passes ""heaven's judgment"" upon them.","Monkey D.

Episode 154,Godland Skypiea! The Angels Of the Cloud Beach,11-May-03,"As the crew arrives in Skypiea, they are greeted by Conis and her pet Su. Conis and her father start explaining how the life in Skypiea is and how the different Dials work.","The Straw Hats, with the help of the Speedy Crab, are finally transported to Skypiea. Robin mentions the sign Skypiea which they see and Nami indicates that it is the same name on the map which Luffy had in a destroyed ship previously. The Straw Hat Pirates land on Skypiea and begin exploring the new environment. They comment on the fluffy cloud, the fluffy cushion, the fruit - Conasshu, the flowers, etc. While exploring, they hear the sound of a musical instrument and Zoro comments that someone is present. Usopp thinks it's a guerilla and upon seeing the figure, Sanji comments that it was an angel.
The angel named Conis greets them and asks if they were Blue Sea Dwellers and Luffy responds that they came from the Blue Sea. She offers to open the Conasshu for Luffy stating the outside of the fruit is as hard as steel and cannot be bit into. Conis finally introduces herself and the cloud fox Su. She asks to be of service if they have questions. At that time, her father comes riding towards them. Nami asks what it is he is riding on and Conis responds that it is called a Waver.
Nami then remembers that the Waver is the equipment Noland mentioned in his travel log, a ship that sails without wind. She asks how it's possible and Conis responds asking if they have heard of dials. Luffy tries riding the waver but is unable to control the machine. Nami borrows the waver and rides it skillfully to the surprise of everyone including Pagaya who says it takes 10 years of practice to learn how to ride the waver. Nami asks Pagaya if she can ride some more on the waver and he agrees. Usopp comments on the construction site he found and Pagaya tells them it is the site where clouds are cut for construction. He explains to them regarding Sea Clouds and the Island Clouds as well as the technology behind the Seastone.
They arrive at Conis' house and Sanji goes to the kitchen to explore the Sky Cuisine while Robin asks Conis to explain more about dials to them. Luffy is already holding on to one when Conis asks him to say something into the dial. After that she tells him to press the apex of the dial and what he says was repeated. She explains that the dial is called the Tone Dial. Conis goes ahead and explains the various types of dials, how and where the sea shells are found and the dial behind the use of a waver.
Sanji brings out their food and comments on not seeing Nami on the sea. Usopp indicates that she may have gone exploring and Conis and Pagaya state their uneasiness. Conis tells them of the place where they must not go under any circumstance. The place adjacent to the Island and easily reached with the Waver. Meanwhile, Nami arrives at a place and comments on how huge the place is. The rest of the crew asks Conis what she means and she tells them the place they must never go to The Land Where God Resides - Upper Yard.","Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Nami, Monkey D.

The Island Where God Resides and Heaven's Judgment!",18-May-03,"Nami finds out what will happen to anyone who enters the forest. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang are waiting for the wind to change but are rudely assaulted by Skypiea's police who are going to carry out Heaven's Judgment.","Conis begins by explaining that since Skypiea is also known as God's Land, it is ruled by almighty God Enel. She further says that God Enel knows everything that goes on in the world by always watching them. The Straw Hats are surprised when Conis tells them that God is watching them at the present time. Zoro comments on how he does not believe in the entity called - God and he holds nothing against those who believe. Sanji asks Conis if she has ever seen the God and Conis replies saying that she has never seen the God because Upper Yard is forbidden to enter.
Nami arrives at a place and comments with surprise that there is ""earth"" even on Sky Island. Luffy becomes excited when he hears that the Upper Yard is a place that is forbidden. He goes on to ask Conis if the God would forgive anyone who goes in there and Conis responds that she does not know. Robin asks for the consequences of visiting the Upper Yard and Pagaya states that they are sure such a person would not come back alive. Pagaya then asks if they were worried about Nami and Luffy responds in an excited manner that they would have to go to Upper Yard to get Nami. Meanwhile, Nami is amazed at the size of the trees seen at where she is currently located. She then hears voices talking about how they were going to get some treasure. Nami indicates to herself that people are present there and follows the trail of the voice.
The rest of the crew decide to go in search of Nami. While Luffy is trying to consume as much food as he can, Sanji inquires from Conis how to get to the Upper Yard. Conis responds that they aren't sure Nami went there and by going there they could receive the wrath of God Enel. On reaching the trail of the voice she heard, Nami arrives at a place and sees a waver. While looking around, a bird flies on a shell and presses it down before flying away. At that point, voices come out of the shell and Nami understands that the shell could record voices. After listening to the event that had been recorded by the voices, Nami understands that the people were killed by the God. She tells herself that she needs to go back and the farther away she got from her current location will be the best.
At that instant, she hears a loud noise and sees a man running while being chased by someone else. The Straw Hats have boarded their ship to go in search of Nami. The man running is seen to be chased by one of the priests of the Upper Yard. As he is about to be eaten by the dog belonging to the priest, another priest flying on a bird kicks the dog and goes after the man. A third priest joins the pursuit and the man now has three priests chasing after him. Nami, back on her waver, tells herself that there is something going on in the forest. Luffy decides to take the old waver to go in search of Nami since Pagaya told them they cannot sail because the wind is not favorable. Luffy ends up sinking and is rescued by Zoro. Pagaya examines the waver the Straw Hats brought and offers to fix it if it is fixable while being a dial ship engineer.
While Nami is watching, the priests are arguing amongst themselves who gets to kill the man when a man in a mask and bazooka appears behind Nami and fires it towards the priests. While before Nami, the man being chased appears and begs to join her on her waver. She responds that only one person could fit, but he threatens to kill her and get the waver. At that point, he got struck by a mass of lightning and he cries ""God"". Nami then overhears the priests talking about illegal entrants and she remembers Amazon telling them to pay the immigration toll. She hurries back to tell the rest of the crew about the event that occurred.
Just as Luffy is imploring Pagaya to fix their waver, they see some men telling them to wait and later crawling towards them. Usopp says they may be crawling because they are perverts and Chopper states so that is what a pervert is like. While the White Berets exchange greetings with Conis and her father, Luffy is still baffled as to what they are speaking. McKinley, Captain of the White Berets then tells the Straw Hats that they are there to bestow the Heaven's Judgment on them.","Monkey D.

Skypiea's Upholders of the Law,8-Jun-03,"The White Berets come to arrest the Straw Hat Pirates for not paying their entrance, but they are easily defeated by Luffy and Nami.","The White Berets confront the Straw Hats telling them to pay the immigration fee. However, the Straw Hats refuse to pay, claiming that the fee is too expensive and also they cannot afford that amount of money. They are still worried that Nami has not returned and ignore the White Berets to discuss how they can get Nami back. Usopp tries to pacify the White Berets by telling the crew to calmly wait for Nami's return and tells the captain of the White Berets, McKinley, to be patient and that they would pay the fee when Nami returns.
McKinley goes on to link almost everything the Straw Hats do to a crime including owning a waver, hitting a rare fish (which was about to eat Conis) and Zoro's act about wanting to fight McKinley because of his ongoing talks about them committing a crime. Usopp told McKinley that Zoro just meant it as a joke and not actually cutting McKinley. Chopper got angry and stated that all McKinley is doing is trying to make them guilty by all means. Usopp tried to pacify Chopper and Chopper said all they are doing is standing around doing nothing. An idea came to Usopp and he said they could do something which is - sleep. McKinley on seeing this accused them of environmental pollution. Luffy and Zoro became angry and were ready to fight the White Berets; Usopp continued to try to pacify them.
At that point, Nami returned yelling for Luffy not to get anyone upset after noticing that the Skypiea authorities have made contact with the Straw Hats. On hearing the high amount of money Usopp told her about the immigration fee, Nami in anger hit McKinley with her Waver and told them to run. Usopp asked what crime Nami committed and was told it was a class 5 crime punishable by cloud drifting.
Nami told the rest of the crew what she had seen earlier and told them they have to leave immediately. The rest of the crew agreed. However, Luffy was displeased and refused to leave. Although Nami tried convincing him, Luffy remained adamant about not leaving. Conis then appeared and told them to hurry but McKinley told her that if she continues to aid the Straw Hats, she and her father would be punished as well. The White Berets then launched an attack on Luffy but he easily defeated them. McKinley laughed and told the Straw Hats that there is no escaping anymore.

However, Luffy remains adamant in not leaving until he visits the Upper Yard. Just as they are about to leave, Luffy asks Pagaya if they could take the rest of the food left in his house and he agrees. Luffy calls Sanji to come along to pack them lunches. Usopp then asks if he could take some materials that may be needed to fix a ship and Pagaya again agrees. The three of them leave to Conis house while the rest of the crew goes to the ship.
Conis then approaches the rest of the crew on the ship to tell them about a special cloud they could get on that would get them past the White Sea quickly and get them to Cloud End faster. Nami is excited to hear the news and states they just need to get there on time before Luffy realizes. Conis then tells them to raise their anchor and wait for the 3 that went up to her house. While at Conis house, Luffy notices she was not around and Pagaya tells them she went to give her regards to the rest of the crew.
After Conis left, Nami comments about seeing a ray of hope in their situation. Robin then questions if such a special cloud existed and if it did, it would not be unusual for Skypieans to live in the Blue Sea. However, Nami and Chopper disapproves it and Chopper uses Heavy Point to raise the anchor of their ship. Conis returns to her house and there Luffy and Sanji are going back andeal on food when Usopp gets up and looks towards the sea. The rest of the crew are awaiting the return of the 3 that left to Conis' house when they felt the ship move. Usopp then notices that something is going on and calls the attention of the other 2. They come out and realize that the ship has started to sail. Luffy comments on how cool it was that the ship was sailing backwards but Usopp tells them to look closely and they can see a shadow underneath the ship pulling the ship along with it.
Zoro wonders if they have gotten on the special current and Robin tells him that was not the case. While trying to understand the situation, Pagaya tells them that which is pulling their ship is the Super-Express Speed Shrimp. Zoro tells the rest of them to jump out of the ship and he would think of something but they were worried at what would happen to the ship if they left it. Zoro cuts the Speedy Shrimp and Robin tells him to stop because others will come after them. She says it may just be the beginning and Zoro comments on Heaven's Judgment saying the God is calling them forth.
Luffy, Usopp and Sanji ask where the rest of the crew are taken to and Pagaya says the Super-Express Speed Shrimp is a servant of God and most likely they are taken to the Sacrificial Altar at the Upper Yard. Sanji is very angry at God and Pagaya goes on to explain that people who are to become sacrifices receive one of the two judgments of heaven. They are either the sacrifice or the ordeal. He goes on to explain that the people being judged are the three of them left behind. Pagaya describes to them how to reach the location of the Sacrificial Altar. Luffy then replies that so all they have to do is to beat the priests and that things just got interesting.","Monkey D.

Luffy, Usopp and Sanji arrive at Lovely Street, still being followed by the White Berets. Lovely Street is a busy place with lots of markets, but the people around there seem to be avoiding them because they have been branded as being criminals. Luffy seems to be enjoying himself by fiddling with the things for sale like dials and other things. Conis finds the docks and head over there with Luffy and the others. The towns people seem to realize that the Straw Hats are leaving and that they will be saved from Enel's wrath. Luffy and Co. arrive at the Gondola Port, Luffy wants to ride a Gondola but they have to ride the crow. Luffy refuses to leave Lovely Street unless he takes the Gondola with the bull. Sanji comically beats up Luffy and makes him apologize to Conis. Conis told them to go through Gate 2 which will take them to the Milky road that leads to Upper Yard. Luffy questions Conis about why she has been trembling since they left her house. Sanji believes that Conis is worried about them but Usopp thinks something's wrong since Conis is leading them while the rest of the town is avoiding them. McKinley and the rest of the Skypieans watch as Conis reveals the secret mission Skypieans must complete when outsiders come to their land to Luffy, Sanji and Usopp causing the Skypieans to back away slowly.
A flashback of Pagaya and Conis appear. Pagaya thinks the Straw Hats are just like other ""Sea Dwellers"" and will back away from their dreams, making them retreat from Upper Yard.

Luffy tries to run away holding Conis, but the light is too big destroying some houses in the progress.
After the explosion, it seemed unsure whether Luffy or Conis were still alive. The Skypieans believed that should happen to anyone who denies Enel's power. A voice sounds that both people are safe. Gan Fall along with Pierre saved both Luffy and Conis. Gan Fall asked Luffy what will he do, Luffy answers that they will go to Upper Yard and save their friends. McKinley was surprised that they were leaving for the Upper Yard saying they were leaving without a single hesitation. The episode ends with Luffy, Sanji and Usopp heading to Upper Yard.","Monkey D.

He introduced himself to Robin and she inquired what he wanted of her, which Yama answered she would see soon enough.
Chopper in a scared expression before Gedatsu, commented on how Gedatsu's eyes are rolled back and his white eyes appear scary. A Divine Soldier tells Gedatsu to direct his eyes, so as to see the enemy and Gedatsu did so in a shocked expression. This surprised Chopper who then thought Gedatsu to be stupid. Chopper realized Gedatsu was an enemy and said to Gedatsu that he must be one of the priests. Gedatsu introduced himself and his Ordeal however, he was not speaking out loud. The Divine Soldier again told Gedatsu to speak out loud or else he will not be heard. Gedatsu, surprised, said he was careless and told Chopper he is in the Ordeal of Swamp which has a 50% survival chance, but only due to his incompetence, otherwise it would be 5%. Gedatsu, flying on his Milky Dial, commented that a tanuki is not worth his time and attempted to attack Chopper with the Numagumo Burger. However, the attack hit the Divine Soldier instead. Chopper realized it is a cloud attack that cannot come off and sucks the victim in the more the victim tries to fight off the cloud.

Gedatsu, not aware of what is going on, kicked Chopper away and launched another Numagumo Burger. Chopper dodged the attack and jumped into the sky. Gedatsu commented the sky is where he fights his battles and followed Chopper. Only upon jumping into the sky, did Gedatsu notice that one of his shoes were missing. He launched another Jet Punch which missed Chopper, who then retaliated by attacking Gedatsu using Arm Point: Obit Cross. Gedatsu falls into the swamp and Chopper was temporarily relieved, until he saw Gedatsu still moving. Chopper began to yell for Gedatsu to sink deeper into the swamp. Gedatsu tried using the Milky Dial on his other foot to escape but that pushed him all the way into the swamp; Chopper then praised himself for beating Gedatsu.

However, once the five minutes is up, he would fight Kamakiri. On that, Kamakiri began his attack on Enel.
Nami and Satori's brothers have began their fight aboard the Going Merry. The brothers were kicking about the unconscious Sanji and Usopp which got Nami very angry. She went ahead to hit one of them with her staff and was attacked with a Flavor Dial with the flavor of farts. Gan Fall after observing the brothers was able to tell the number of dials they were fighting with. On knowing that, Gan Fall began his attack on them, so did Nami. Gan Fall was attacked with a Breath Dial which he dodged and went ahead to fight and defeat Kotori. Nami then knocked Hotori away using the Cyclone Tempo. Gan Fall instructed Nami to fetch and use his gauntlet, which has an Impact Dial embedded in it to fight Hotori because he will be returning. Nami launched a Cool Ball on Hotori, to which he got upset and used his flame dial as a counterattack which only helped foster Nami's attack. Nami then launched Fog Tempo to obscure herself and launch an Impact on Hotori, which defeated him.
Conis, Aisa and Pagaya are on their way to the Straw Hat Pirates ship. Aisa is very scared commenting that voices of people keep disappearing.

Just as Gan Fall left, Nami was about to begin first-aid treatment on Sanji and Usopp when Conis and her father arrived. Pagaya explained to her that they need to escape using his Milky Dial onto the White-White Sea and leave Skypiea. Pagaya also gave her the waver they had brought with them, all refurbished.
The battle continues between the Shandia warriors and the Divine Soldiers and Kamakiri is still on his five minute allowable time to fight Enel without Enel counterattacking. Kamakiri eventually realizes and tells Enel that he cannot defeat Enel. Enel went on to explain that he is that referred to as God since his powers cannot be explained, therefore he is feared. Kamakiri decides to flee and warn Wyper about Enel's abilities, however, Enel cornered him stating that his five minutes are up and now he can counterattack. Enel then defeated Kamakiri using the 1,000,000 volts Vari. The attack traveled through the Milky Road and defeated 20 other fighters, Shandia warriors and Divine Soldiers alike. Enel then summarized that after two hours of battle at the Upper Yard with 81 people beginning the battle, 56 have been defeated, 13 remain from his army, 5 from the Straw Hat crew and 7 Shandia warriors making a total of 25 people remaining, per his calculation.

Nami stated she needed to take the ship to their point of rendezvous and since the four are together, she is not so worried. Aisa then told her that there is no group bigger than two at Upper Yard or else she would know. Nami attributed the response to Aisa's ability of Mantra.
Luffy is still attempting to make his way out of the ""cave"" and is very much hungry. He wondered if the rest of the exploration crew had found their way to the City of Gold. Zoro decided to take a break and eat lunch when a Skypiean Southbird arrived. The bird was interested in Zoro's meal and although he finishes the meal without offering the bird any, the bird continued to follow him.

Ohm told Chopper not to worry as Holy would not bite him unless he has reason to do so because the dog is well trained by him. Ohm recognized Chopper as the one who defeated Gedatsu. Chopper tried retreating only to step over a person. He thought Holy must have bit the person down however, Ohm told Chopper he was the one that defeated the individual. Ohm began mourning the person he killed saying he is unable to understand why humans fight even when they are so weak, and that death is the only way for them to be truly saved. Ohm told Chopper that by being present, a fight is inevitable and that he would ""save"" Chopper.
Raki is seen traveling down the Milky Road and wondering why everyone appeared to have been burnt to a crisp, like being hit by lightning. She found Kamakiri who told her to find Wyper and notify him that Enel is not at the God's Shrine and that no one can beat Enel. Kamakiri told Raki that Enel is what is known as lightning, hence making him invincible. Raki left to find Wyper and commented on her way how Kamakiri's spirit has been broken asking herself how Enel ended up having the Goro Goro no Mi.
Zoro got to the place that appeared to be the sacrificial altar and realized it is a place he has seen before. The giant South Bird is still with him and he blamed it on the bird for wanting a free meal. He threw his bag aside and the bird, on seeing the bag imagined food to be in it and drooled. The bird picked the bag and Zoro hung onto the straps, yelling to the bird that there is no food in the bag. Luffy reached a dead end and thought of it as being a trick door. He thought breaking through it will make a way out and then attacked it with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka. However, nothing occurred-only a rumbling that sent Luffy falling further in. Chopper is seen running from Ohm in fear and came to a hiding spot. He commented on Ohm being a swordsman and by keeping his distance he can escape and find the others.

Zoro wondered how a dog could make such a move and Ohm introduced Holy, further commenting that he trains animals and is otherwise known as Sky Breeder.

He recognized Robin as an archeologist and told her that she is a few years late with regards to finding the gold. Robin asked if he also has the golden bell only to realize that Enel knows nothing of it. Robin discarded the idea saying that if Enel did not find it, then the Bell never made it to the sky.

Looking around, Luffy spotted his crew and ran towards them only to realize that they have been defeated, including Zoro. Luffy questioned who must have done such a deed after seeing that even Wyper, who is strong, is defeated. Aisa mentioned that it was only Enel who could do something like that. Since her Mantra was ineffective while stranded in the belly of the snake, she was unable to tell what was occurring on the outside. Just then, Robin regained consciousness and told Luffy of Enel's intention in destroying all of Skypiea. Luffy inquired about the Golden Belfry and Robin told him the possibility of Enel getting to it. Aisa then told Luffy she knows their location as she is able to ""hear"" two voices on the island of their location. Luffy then told Aisa to take him to the location of the voices.","Enel, Wyper, Braham (K.O), Genbo (K.O), Kamakiri (K.O), Raki (K.O), Shandia Chief (flashback), Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper (K.O), Nico Robin, Gan Fall (K.O), Nola (K.O), Monkey D.

Episode 182,Finally Clashing! Pirate Luffy vs God Enel!!,22-Feb-04,"Finally, Luffy meets up with Enel. During the battle, Enel realizes that he cannot hurt Luffy because he is made of rubber. Meanwhile, Conis tells the dangers of staying in Angel Island to the other Skypieans.","Conis is seen riding a waver towards Angel Island. At Lovely Street, McKinley announces to the public that Conis, Pagaya and Gan Fall, their former God, are on the run and that any information related to their capture should be reported to him and the White Berets. The citizens are concerned that if the three are hiding nearby, then God's judgement may land on the citizens as well. Just then, a soldier reports to McKinley that Conis has appeared at the harbor. As Conis advances with her waver, the White Berets are shooting arrows towards her. McKinley wonders why Conis is acting like she wants to be captured and proceeds to order for her capture. As the White Berets prepare to stop her advance, Conis continues to approach them with full speed, asking them to get out of her way. She manages to run over McKinley and as she jumps off of the waver, the waver crashes into McKinley and against a building. Conis finds herself surrounded by worried citizens who are afraid that God's judgement will be cast upon her, and that they'll get caught in it.
At the Arc Maxim, Enel is laughing and mentions to Nami that Conis has caused a scene at Angel Island, to which Nami responds that she was supposed to be at the Going Merry. Nami asks Enel about his Mantra abilities, particularly on his ability to identify people. Enel explains that he is able to use his lightning powers to read radio waves within Skypeia and if he hears a conversation he doesn't like, he casts his judgement. Nami begins to worry again and wonders how she'll escape. Enel stares at her direction and she asks him if something's wrong. Enel stares away and wonders whose presence he is sensing and then mentions to Nami that it was nothing.
Back at Angel Island, Conis is begging the crowd to hear her out, to which the citizens respond back to stay away from them. A soldier attempts to attack her but Conis aims her Burn Bazooka at him, threatening to shoot. She then tells the crowd to go to the edge of the clouds at Cloud End so they can escape by boats to the Blue Sea, as the island will be destroyed by Enel. The crowd remains skeptical and a child throws a tomato at her face. Conis drops her Burn Bazooka and McKinley wonders what she is about to do. Shocking the crowd, she yells out that she does not accept Enel as God. The crowd runs away and hides, as to not receive God's judgement.
Eventually, the crowd notices that nothing happened to her and she responds saying that there's no point to God casting judgement on her when the whole island will be eliminated. She tells them that this message is from a soldier who risked his life to tell Pagaya and her this information, before judgement was cast on her father and the soldier. The crowd remains uneasy, as the same child asks why a God that helps them would do such a thing. Conis again pleads them to go to Cloud End, but the citizens express concern on leaving their homeland and relocating in the unknown Blue Sea. She tells them this is better than getting killed and that for the past six years, they all should know what kind of man Enel is. The crowd remains uncertain, believing that the events she fears may not happen or that a miracle will save them.
In shock at the crowd's stubbornness, Conis shoots her Burn Bazooka into the clouds. She reminds them that Enel has the power to keep them in despair and that time is running out and that waiting for a miracle to happen won't save them. She concludes to them that lying low as victims is no longer safe and that they must take action now to leave the island, for they can no longer protect their lives by blaming someone later. The crowd is moved by this and many of them go to pack their things and head to Cloud End. Some members of the crowd remain, asking of the status of their family members that are part of the Divine Squad, to which she responds that she doesn't know. They ask what the Divine Squad is doing in the first place, and McKinley interrupts them saying the White Berets will figure it out and tells the crowd to go ahead and that the Divine Squad will catch up to them.
The crowd is convinced and leaves, and McKinley tells Conis that he can't let this island turn into Birka, a southeastern sky island that Enel was raised on that disappeared six years ago, implying Enel destroyed his home island before coming to Skypeia. McKinley reveals that prior to Enel's arrival, McKinley used to serve under Gan Fall's Divine Squad. McKinley formed the White Berets knowing that while it would appear to betray the Divine Squad, he would be able to protect the island by enforcing Enel's rule. The White Berets gave the island years of stability by ensuring that no one would anger God, but McKinley now admits it was all for nothing if the island is truly eliminated. Conis tells McKinley that he had the people's safety prioritized, and that is nothing to be ashamed of. Conis asks him to continue to protect the people so she can help the Straw Hats escape.
Luffy and Aisa riding on Pierre are seen running towards the location of the Arc Maxim. Robin wakes up and realizes that she can't carry Zoro, Wyper, Chopper, Gan Fall and herself up the stalk to escape at once but that they still need to escape to the upper area. Enel realizes that the presence he senses is not one of the five that survived and wonders where this new presence was hiding. Enel jumps towards the edge of the Arc Maxim to see and hear Luffy screaming for him. Nami runs over to see a determined Luffy ready to fight back. As Enel and Luffy exchange words, Aisa and Pierre are hiding and witnessing their display and she worries for Luffy's safety. As Nami attempts to warn Luffy of Enel's powers, Enel stares at her which stops her from talking. Enel comments that he can hear Angel Island running about and that they must've realized what will happen to them. Luffy asks him what makes him God and Enel responds he'll know soon enough. Luffy runs up and stretches his arm to get onto a platform, to which Enel comments that Luffy is no ordinary human either, but only a Paramecia user.
As Enel charges El Thor, Luffy rushes towards him, but El Thor is fired. Nami and Aisa scream at the display. As the smoke clears out, a giant hole is seen in the walls, and Luffy looks at it questionably before returning his gaze to Enel. To Nami's surprise and to Enel's amazement, Luffy dodged the attack. Enel charges up 60 Million Volt Jamboule and fires it at Luffy, which catches him this time. The smoke clears again to show an unharmed Luffy. Enel zaps out of his space to appear directly in front of Luffy this time and uses 100 Million Volt Vaari. Nami then realizes that Enel's attacks are useless, as electric attacks don't affect the rubber properties of Luffy's body. Luffy yells out that he's had enough and after that final attack by Enel failed, shocked faces from Nami, Aisa, Pierre and finally Enel are revealed. Enel shakes his head thinking that physical attacks won't harm his body but as Luffy runs towards him, he successfully kicks and damages Enel. Nami now realizes that Enel's lightning effects can't protect him either, and that Luffy may be the only natural enemy to Enel.

Episode 183,Maxim Rises! The Start of Deathpiea!!,29-Feb-04,The fight between Enel and Luffy continues with Enel starting a machine that would bring the death of Skypiea: Deathpiea.,"The episode starts as Nami rehashes what she realized at the end of the previous episode: that because rubber does not conduct electricity, Luffy is immune to Enel's lightning attacks. Enel wakes up and jumps away from Luffy. He does not understand what Luffy is and Luffy tells him that he is a pirate and a rubberman which puzzles Enel even more as the White-White Sea does not have rubber.
Luffy attacks Enel again but due to his mantra, Enel dodges every shot and starts to fight back with his golden staff and pins Luffy against a wall. He points out that lightning is not the only weapon he can use and once he realizes something does not work, he can adapt his strategy accordingly. Still, Luffy escapes and tells him hitting him won't work either. 
Both adversaries are frustrated at each other: Luffy because of Enel's mantra and Enel because he still does not understand what rubber is. Upon remembering that Luffy's Devil Fruit was a Paramecia-type, he uses his electric power to turn his golden cane into a spear and attacks Luffy with it. To Nami's dismay, Luffy does confirm out loud that piercing attacks work on him. 
The fight continues. Luffy tries to use the gatling gun attack in the air but Enel suddenly dematerializes and reappears through the gold of the ship to attack Luffy with the spear. Luffy dodges it but burns his hands holding the spear. As Enel explains that he can use his electric powers to heat the weapon, Luffy counterattacks him into the ground. Enel then grabs Luffy's arms and crashes him into the ground as well.
Getting up, Enel gives a speech about the new world he is going to start and how Luffy can't stop him and walks away. Using his lightning powers, he turns on Ark Maxim which starts lifting into the air. Aisa and Pierre who had been watching the fight from below are panicked about what to do. Nami is also panicked and tries to figure out what to do. If Enel is killed, the ark will crash into the ground since it runs on his powers but if they let him fly it, Skypiea will be destroyed. Standing up, Luffy throws his straw hat onto her head and tells her as the crewmate of the future Pirate King, she should have more faith. Enel is intrigued by the title and Luffy tells him the Pirate King rules the greatest sea in the world and Enel is appreciative, but the fight has to go on. Maxim starts to fly away but is slightly stuck on the walls of the cave. Aisa is riding Pierre and Pierre seems to suggest they should get on board as well but she tells him that a warrior's duel should never be interrupted and that this is Luffy's fight.
Meanwhile, the people of Angel Island are all rushing to get out of the island. McKinley is trying to guide them and avoid panic. He notices an old man who is just sitting there teary-eyed. He says he has believed in God for too long and is ready to accept whatever fate God has in store for him. But McKinley gives him a teary-eyed speech about how God does not have the right to take their lives away from them and they have a duty to survive. The old man decides to leave and his grandson is grateful to McKinley. Several villagers approach McKinley to tell him they are going to the Shandia Village to warn them too of the impending disaster.
Enel tells Luffy and Nami that the ship's ""ultimate function"" - Deathpiea - has been activated and the chimney starts spewing out black clouds into the sky. All around, the islands' people notice the clouds in the sky. Robin who has now gotten up is looking wistfully at Zoro, Chopper and Gan Fall, when Wyper notices the dark clouds. Some Shandia also look at them and say this is the first time it has ever happened in Skypiea and this portends bad news about the warriors that are on Upper Yard. The inhabitants of Angel Island also panic at the sight of the clouds and think this is the beginning of the end.
Enel explains that Deathpiea uses Enel's electric energy to condense intense air currents and create thunderclouds. Once they spread all over Skypiea, Enel will be able to destroy the whole island with lightning. To illustrate his point, he lifts his arm and a huge lightning bolt comes out of the thunderclouds and destroys several buildings on Angel Island in front of the horrified fleeing inhabitants. McKinley and then Conis on her waver both see this from afar and curse Enel. Enel tells Luffy and Nami that this was simply a ""tease"".
Luffy is appalled that being God means taking away anything Enel wants to take away. Enel says he will now take Luffy's life. The fight restarts and each combatant is able to dodge the others attacks although Luffy keeps burning his feet and hands with the spear any time he pushes it away.
After Enel could not predict one of Luffy's instinctive dodges of a spear attack and slightly damages the ship, Luffy gets an idea and puts himself in a Gomu Gomu no Daze state. Enel keeps attacking with his spear but Luffy bobs and weaves like a ""grass in the wind"" and does not get hurt. Nami realizes that Luffy's plan was to put himself into an ""unthinking"" mode. He reflexively dodges the attack using the air currents but because he is in a daze, he does so unconsciously and Enel's mantra can't predict what his movements are going to be.
Luffy snaps himself out of it and points out that in that dazed state, he can't go on the attack. Then Luffy goes Gomu Gomu no Tako (Octopus) and Nami is appalled he is trying out a new silly idea. Luffy's arms and legs turn into tentacles and Luffy turns around and starts to punch like crazy at a wall of Maxim's. Enel is nonplussed and thinks Luffy is trying to destroy the ship. Enel lunges at Luffy but Luffy's hundreds of punching arms ricochet from the wall back onto Enel and Enel is pummeled. Nami realizes that because the hits are coming from the natural ricochet of the punches on the wall and not anything Luffy is thinking, Enel can't see them coming.
Luffy ""bazooka-es"" into Enel and Enel is weakened and bloodied and starts to panic. As the episode ends, we see Luffy lunging at Enel preparing a Gomu Gomu no Rifle attack and an obviously desperate Enel trying to get up and telling himself he needs to get away.","Monkey D.

Episode 184,Luffy's Fall! God's Judgment and Nami's Desire!!,7-Mar-04,Enel does another trick by creating a ball of gold from the ship and attaches it to Luffy's arm. Luffy falls from the ark with the ball stuck on his hand. Nami starts fighting Enel while Sanji and Usopp try to rescue her.,"As the episode begins, Luffy finishes his Gomu Gomu no Rifle attack on Enel and punches him into one of the golden walls of Ark Maxim.
At that moment, Ark Maxim gets unstuck and starts rising in the air. Aisa and Pierre who are flying to the side watch and panic about what to do. A bleeding Enel gets back up and gives a big speech about how once he beats Luffy, he will be able to have his own world where he is feared and worshiped again and nothing is impossible because he is God.
The people of Angel Island are still fleeing and some of them notice in disbelief of the Ark flying in the sky. They notice the black clouds are coming out of it and surmise God must be on board. On some clouds further away, the Shandia are gathered and notice the Angel Islanders boarding so many boats and wonder what is going on. A boat approaches and an Angel Islander on it warns the Shandia that the land is on the brink of destruction and they should board their own ships immediately as well to flee to the Blue Sea.
Robin has started to move Chopper and Zoro's bodies and sees the Ark in the sky. She immediately guesses this is Enel's doing. Enel tells Luffy that the Angels will soon perish and nothing can stop him. Luffy lounges at Enel but Enel uses his electricity to melt some of the gold wall and traps Luffy's hand in the extremely hot golden ball that was formed. Enel tells Luffy that he will not bother continue fighting him and rolls the balls off the flying ship. Thanks to his stretchy arm and the side wall of the ship, Luffy resists but the ball in which Luffy's hand is encased is pulling him down like an anchor. Enel tells Luffy that now that Luffy is restrained Enel is supreme again. Angrily, Luffy tells him that down on the Blue Sea, there are plenty of other people with similar abilities that can beat him too. A furious Enel uses his spear to destroy the shipwall Luffy was using to resist being pulled down and Luffy starts to fall into a massive hole below. Luffy curses Enel and screams at him to actually fight.
Aisa and Pierre see this and starts flying near Luffy to help him. Enel notices them and realizes they are the two extra voices he could feel. He then proceeds to launch a ""God's Judgment"" thunderbolt at the three. Nami screams in despair. Conis on her waver sees the Ark and guesses that this is what the Enforcers were being forced to build. She flashbacks to Nami showing her the meeting point of the Straw-Hat Pirates on the Northeast coast of the island and decides to go there and reach the Going Merry to guide them down to the Blue Sea once they all gather back there - as only she can tell them how to escape Skypiea.
Sanji is speaking in his sleep and is having a beautiful dream where he is in paradise with Nami. In his sleep, he starts to cuddle with Usopp and wakes up horrified and disappointed as he wanted to stay in the dream with Nami. Now up, he wonders where Nami is and bolts onto the deck. He sees the ark in the air and is surprised and some kind of ""special ability"" allows him to see from afar that Nami is on board. He does not understand what is going on. Sanji wakes Usopp up and tells him to get ready to rescue Nami. Usopp is confused but remembers God's appearance on the boat. Sanji feels guilty about being unable to prevent Nami being kidnapped by God. Sanji shows Usopp the Ark and both are confused. What is going on? Where is everyone? All Sanji knows is that Nami was on the Ark and she wasn't wearing her T-shirt. Sanji and a reluctant Usopp run into the forest to try and board the Ark before it gets away too far from them. Sanji wants to use Usopp AAaaaAAAaaaAA, the belt with a rope and a hook that Usopp used earlier in the Lost Forest.
Enel retells Nami his plans to destroy Skypiea and ascend to Fairy Vearth using Ark Maxim. He also tells himself he needs to get the Golden Bell that Robin had mentioned to him earlier first. Nami looks upset and Enel asks her about the future she desires now that she has survived that long. She tells him that there is plenty that she wants to have and wants to do but if she follows Enel, she will be alone. Without her friends, then there is nothing that she actually wants. Enel assumes that must include her life as well.
Conis is now on the Going Merry and asks Su what is going on and why Sanji and Usopp are gone. Su tells her of their plan to jump in the Ark to save Nami and Conis thinks that this is too dangerous because of the injuries they sustained.
Sanji is on a high rock as the Ark is flying over them and despite Usopp's bout of ""can't-go-to-high-places"" disease, they launch the Usopp AAaaaAAAaaaAA and Sanji kicks it toward the Ark. Enel lectures Nami about her foolish decision to forgo her only chance to survive and tells her the only place she can go upon leaving the ship is the afterlife. Sanji is climbing the rope that is now hooked onto the lower decks of the Ark while Usopp - who is wearing the belt at the other end of the rope - is dangling in the air and screaming below. Sanji says that if God Enel harms Nami, Sanji will have to turn into the Devil of the Blue Sea.
Nami is facing Enel and is pumping herself up. She tells herself she will put everything she has to survive this and, thinking of the rest of the crew, she wants to be able to sail the sea with them one more time. As the episode ends, we see Enel standing up while Nami looks at him with a determined look on her face... and holding the Clima-Tact behind her back.","Monkey D.

Episode 185,Two People Awaken! A Rescue in Front of Burning Love!!,14-Mar-04,"Usopp and Sanji split up to rescue Nami, but the first one to get on deck is Usopp who cowardly tries to save Nami. After failing, Usopp is almost killed but saved at the last second by Sanji, who stays behind to allow Usopp and Nami to escape.","As the episode starts, we are back to the Enel and Nami stand-off. Enel tells Nami that she obviously can't leave the ship ""safely"" now that she has told him all those things. Nami thinks to herself that she has no regrets about doing that because even though she knows she can't beat Enel, she can't stay on the ship either. Enel shocks Nami by asking her if she is counting on the ""two rats"" that have snuck aboard (meaning Sanji and Usopp) to save her.
Usopp - who is now also climbing the outside wall of the ship thanks to some weird starfish shoes while hanging to the rope - is complaining and moaning about being scared of getting on the Ark Maxim and not knowing what to expect on there. He also assumes that there must be thousands of people on a ship that big. Sanji tells him to stop complaining and be stronger as he and his inventions are sorely needed to help. He mentions that Enel probably already knows of their presence thanks to his mantra ability. Once they have entered a large opening on the ship, Sanji suggests - to Usopp's great dismay - that they split up and head straight to the deck. Usopp thinks this means Sanji is assuming at least one of them is bound to die and Sanji tells him that if that saves Nami, he is OK with Usopp potentially dying! Sanji heads inside with Usopp running behind.
Enel thinks the two intruders are fools to try and save Nami and Nami is confused who it could be since the only one whom she knows is still able to move is Luffy. Enel tries to attack Nami with a lightning strike but she manages to dodge. Enel tells her that since the three of them are bound to die anyway, he won't wait for her defenders and might as well start getting rid of her now. Nami is brainstorming what to do to defend herself.
Sanji and Usopp are separately running through the inside the ship and are amazed at the elaborate machinery that is keeping it flying. They both remark to themselves that nobody seems to be around and that the ship seems to be automated even though Usopp is confused on how that could work.
In the ruins of Shandora, Robin is using her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to carry Zoro, Wyper and the others' bodies near Giant Jack. She remarks on the sky getting darker which she thinks means Enel will start the destruction soon and bemoans the fact the Golden Bell is probably right above their heads. 
On Angel Island, the inhabitants are still piling up on boats to flee to the White Sea and someone comments on how ominous the Ark looks.
At the Shandia Village, some Shandia are stunned at the idea of leaving the warriors behind but the Shandia Chief tells them to have faith in them and that everyone must take care of their own problems first. He tells them that Enel is going to destroy Skypiea like he destroyed Birka and it is time to get ready and flee. The Shandia start running around and the Chief thinks of Wyper and the upcoming ""end"" of everything.
On the Going Merry, Conis thinks back of meeting the Straw Hat Pirates and is frustrated that even though it is right here in front of her, she cannot know what is going on on Upper Yard. She prays for their safety.
In a hole on the ground, Aisa is crying over Pierre's apparently lifeless body and thanks him for protecting her. She hears Luffy crying out for her and finds he landed in a very awkward position. Luffy manages to lift the golden ball in which his hand is still encased over his head and tells Aisa that this is not over. He knows where the Ark is headed and tells Aisa they are going to the giant beanstalk they earlier found Robin near to.
Nami is using the Clima-Tact to dodge one of Enel's attacks and Enel is amused. Nami is apparently using the Thunder Ball ability of the Clima-Tact to create a path for Enel's lightning attacks to follow away from her. Enel is impressed but says that he just can change his attack so that trick won't work anymore. As he is about to act on his threat, Usopp throws a Hissatsu Kaenboshi at him. Enel and Nami are both surprised to see Usopp and Usopp is surprised to see Sanji is not up on the deck yet so, scared, he runs back inside.
Usopp decides to be courageous and runs back out on the deck and dodges several of Enel's lightning attacks. Then he asks Nami to save him but Nami berates him reminding him he is supposed to be the one saving her. As the two banter, Enel launches another lightning attack and they dodge. Usopp remarks on Nami having the straw hat and she tells him Luffy was just there and got thrown off but will be OK. Usopp says they can't count on Luffy to save them and they are going to have to make it on their own. They dodge another lightning attack.
Usopp suggests they hide behind the big electric tube at the center of the deck since it seems to be powering up something important and Enel will be reluctant to use big attacks near it. Nami points out her Waver is still somewhere on the deck and they can try jumping off the ship with that. Usopp is worried about the height but Nami tells him of an island cloud patch on the island below (that happens to be around Giant Jack) that they are flying over and can try to land on if they go with that plan. Enel attacks Usopp with lightning again. Usopp tells Nami he will distract Enel while she gets everything ready.
Usopp jumps on the electric tube and proclaims an Usopp Spell in which the victim must think of having needles stuck under their nails. Nami is the one distracted by the thought however which irritates Usopp. Usopp tries several other cringe-worthy thoughts to cast an Usopp spell on Enel, but Enel is not plussed and lifts in the air and knocks Usopp with his golden cane. Nami gets the waver but as she screams to Usopp she is ready, Enel burns Usopp's body with his lightning. Enel then turns his attention to Nami and tells her escaping won't be easy. As Enel walks towards her, Nami rides the Waver past him toward Usopp who is showing signs of life and she tells him, as she approaches him, to grab her hand. Usopp lifts his hand for Nami to grab him on the way off the ship but Enel uses his cane to push it back down and Nami rides past Usopp without being able to catch him.
Enel tells Usopp it is too late for him to be saved and as he prepares to strike the final lightning blow, Sanji jumps in, kick-lifts Usopp's body from the floor onto Nami's waver and tells both of them to go off the ship. Nami wants to turn around and help Sanji but Usopp pushes on the accelerator telling her to respect Sanji's resolve to save them and they ride the Waver off the ship and fall into the air. Meanwhile, Enel launches a massive lightning attack at a calm-looking Sanji.
After the attack is done, Enel says that while Nami and Usopp jumped off, they have yet to escape since his attacks can reach them anywhere. But he notices that Sanji, while blackened and apparently weakened, is still standing at the same spot. Sanji thanks Enel for lighting his cigarette and tells him to get ready to cry before collapsing on the floor. Enel shrugs Sanji off before suddenly some parts of Ark Maxim stop working. The black clouds stop coming out of the chimney and some electric connections become unstable. Enel curses Sanji and wonders out loud what that insolent mortal has done to his ship.","Enel, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Roronoa Zoro (K.O), Wyper (K.O), Nico Robin, Gan Fall (K.O), Tony Tony Chopper (K.O), Shandia Chief, Su, Conis, Aisa, Pierre (K.O), Monkey D.

Episode 186,Capriccio to Destruction! The Impending Doom of Sky Island!!,21-Mar-04,Enel's thunderclouds are coming down to Sky Island while the evacuation is half complete.,"The episode starts with Enel shrugging off Sanji then hearing the explosion and seeing the black clouds are not coming out of the chimney anymore. Enel curses Sanji and figured one of the gears must have been dislodged. He dematerializes to go reset it.
Sanji's blackened and seemingly lifeless body is still on the deck. We see Usopp has hooked the Usopp AAaaaAAAaaaAA on a sidewall of the ship and is climbing up the side thanks to his starfish-shoes. He peeks on the deck and sees Enel is gone. Usopp talks to Sanji's body and reassures him that Nami landed safely. Then he carries Sanji's body to the edge of the boat and thinking on how he needs to lands on the island cloud and not in the jungle or the ruins, he uses some special spring shoes - Usopp Hopping - to jump off the ship in the air while carrying a still-unconscious Sanji in his arms. Unfortunately, he jumps too far and starts to panic when he sees his landing spot is going to be right in the middle of the jungle. As he is about to crash though, the rope he is still attached to held him back and they start dangling in the air. The hook then gives in and they start falling back down but land on some island clouds. Nami who is watching from afar goes to get them with her Waver. Nami thanks Sanji who is still unconscious for saving her then tries to pull an upside down Usopp out of the cloud.
On Ark Maxim, we see pipes bursting, glass breaking and pieces of machineries giving in. Enel who is walking inside the ship curses Sanji again. But he then confidently says that it won't be that easy to drop the Ark from the sky as there is a back-up system based on technology from his homeland of Bilka. Using the power of 200 extinct Jet Dials, the Ark can stay in the air for a full extra hour after the propulsion mechanisms have failed. Enel is confident that the ""final performance"" is still coming and using his physical strength starts repairing pieces that were out of joint.
Back on the ground, Nami tells Usopp of the giant bean stalk being also in the ruins of the City of Gold and therefore they must have landed right above it on a higher cloud. Usopp is a bit confused but tells her the priority is to leave because if they stay where they are (with the Ark hovering above them), they could be in trouble. Nami agrees they need to find the others and get off the island.
We see Luffy and Aisa running through the ruins. Aisa is dragging Pierre by the beak and Luffy is running with his arm stretched by the weight of the golden ball behind him. As he runs though, the ball starts getting her own momentum and rolling on her own taking Luffy with her in the wrong direction. Aisa is irritated with Luffy for destroying Shandora by crashing into the walls.
On the Ark, the thunderclouds are being released again. Enel is satisfied and looking forward to his ""final gala"" but is irritated that Sanji's body is gone.
An out-of-breath Luffy has finally arrived at the site of the earlier ""Final 5"" battle but he and Aisa are surprised to see everyone gone - Robin, Zoro, Chopper, Wyper and Gan Fall. They guess that Robin must have used her ability to get everyone back on higher ground already. Aisa is very upset looking at the giant hole Enel's final attack on Wyper had created in the ground. She flashbacks to Robin telling them about Enel's plan to destroy Skypiea and tearingly asks Luffy if this is really going to happen.
Luffy is running up the beanstalk with Aisa and Pierre on his back and still dragging his golden-ball-encased arm behind him. Aisa is hopeful she will get to see Wyper once arrived up there.
We see Robin looking up the stalk and reflecting on the fact the Ark is heading towards the Great Belfry as she expected. She hopes Nami and the boys are safe and are not on board anymore. Luffy is running higher on the stalk and Aisa notices Robin below. She points it out to Luffy who then throws Aisa and Pierre in the air for Robin to take care of. Robin catches them with her Hana Hana no Mi abilities but Luffy is dragged lower down the stalk by the golden ball that had gotten caught in the movement when he threw Aisa below. Robin wonders what the golden ball is about and Luffy confirms with her that the Golden Bell should be at the top of the stalk and that it is what Enel is aiming for. In the background, Aisa is still freaked out about witnessing Robin's multiple arms. And then Luffy's gone before Robin finishes her explanations. Robin then inquires with Aisa about Nami's fate. Aisa first says Nami should be on the Ark then realizes her mantra ability can only pick up one voice left up in the air.
Nami, Usopp and a still-unconscious Sanji arrive on the Waver and everyone reunites. Usopp is upset to see Zoro, Chopper and the others unconscious on the ground and says that if he had been there... Nami inquires about Luffy and Aisa tells her he went up the stalk to face Enel and save her. Everyone commiserates about Luffy and needing to get off the island soon. Nami tells the others to go back to the Going Merry while she is going up the stalk to follow Luffy.
Luffy is still running up the Ark cursing Enel.
At the Shandia village, the Shandia are still rushing to board the ships out of there. One lady is worried about Aisa but the Shandia Chief hopes she is with one of the warriors.
On Angel Island, the sky is still turning dark and people still rushing to flee. Some of the White Berets are informing McKinley they need to use the ships at the wharf, otherwise they won't have enough space to fit everyone. McKinley says there is no time to go there and urges them to create a river with some emergency Dials. Half of the islanders are still on the island and after angrily remembering Conis' speech urging the islanders to flee, McKinley tells the White Berets not to let people take any belongings with them to make sure everyone leaves.
We see that the Milky Road is jammed with boats trying to leave. At Heaven's Gate, Amazon is taking pictures of the fleeing boats and asking for a 2,000,000,000 extol disembarkation fee. People on the boats try to warn her to leave too as Skypiea is about to be destroyed.
At the Going Merry, Conis notices the wind has stopped. Suddenly we hear then see lightning coming out of the thunderclouds and burning trees and attacking buildings and people on Angel Island. Nami, Usopp and the others see the lightning starting to strike and are shocked. Enel says the time has come and the lightning starts to intensify. The jungle on Upper Yard and buildings on Angel Island are getting destroyed and people are panicking. The wharf gets attacked by the lightning and the White Berets try to direct the remaining islanders to the beach where there still are some boats left.
On the Shandia village, the boats still have not left and the Shandia Chief prays to Kalgara for protection.
The huge lightning bolts are destroying parts of Upper Yard and Usopp and the others are getting thrown around. Suddenly, Wyper opens his eyes. Nami again tells the others to flee while she goes to get Luffy. She rides the Waver up the stalk. While Usopp asks Robin to help carry the unconscious bodies, Aisa sees Wyper has woken up and is standing. Zoro and Gan Fall both wake up at that point. Gan Fall asks if Enel has started yet. Chopper, Sanji and Pierre are still unconscious. Robin tells everyone to hurry because there is nothing they can't do here anymore. Wyper seems to be looking wistfully at the destruction before them.
Nami is riding up the beanstalk worrying how Luffy is going to fight an enemy that can fly. Enel is looking at the lightning destroying Upper Yard and enjoying the spectacle. Luffy is running up the beanstalk, golden ball in tow, warning Enel he is not going to get away with it.","Enel, Sanji (K.O.), Usopp, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 187,"Guidance from the Sound of a Bell!
The Great Warrior and Tales of an Explorer",28-Mar-04,"The history of Mont Blanc Noland and Kalgara is told, as a flashback from Wyper.","As Enel watches the destruction, Usopp urges everyone to hurry before everything gets destroyed, and Luffy vows to make Enel pay while running up the stalk. Enel notices the Shandia Village and comments that because they are originally from the Blue Sea, they may ""enjoy"" his plan to destroy Skypiea, sending it back down to the Blue Sea. He then directs the lightning to specifically destroy the village. The Shandia watch in horror from the boat and remark they could have been destroyed along with their village had they not evacuated as fast as they did.
Wyper reminisces about his oath to Kalgara to light the fire of Shandora while Aisa tries to get him to go. He remembers the Shandia Chief telling him as a child about Kalgara's other reason for wanting to protect their homeland. That reason was a friend Kalgara had made, Mont Blanc Noland.
400 years ago, a crew was fleeing on a beach towards their anchored ship. The ""Demon of Shandora"" was on their heels, said one of the crew members. The captain set sail but Kalgara theew the ball-shaped anchor at the ship and jumped aboard to attack the crew. He told them to leave everything and go.
On another ship at sea, Admiral Mont Blanc Noland was told the ship was out of food. He jumped in the water. The crew speculated on him abandoning them but he came back up to the surface, having captured a huge fish for them to eat. The same ship was later caught in a storm. Noland was writing in his logbook when he heard a bell in the distance.
On an island, a dying priest whose skin was covered with green stains told the men surrounding him that Shandia was cursed and that to save the village, a girl must be offered to the Sacrificial Altar. The priest died and the Shandia around him commented that there have been a hundred victims already.
In a castle chamber, Mousse said that if it would save the village, she was willing to offer her body and was looking forward to meeting the Sun God. Her mother sobbed.
A crying young man called Seto was in the forest in the rain trying to get the same type of green skin stain off his arm with a rock. Kalgara walked by and Seto angrily told him he had wanted to be like him one day and instead he was going to die ""like this"".
The storm was dying down and Noland's crew was grateful to him that he had directed them to the island. However, they did not hear the bell like he did. The crew went to shore and saw a Southbird, so they thought the weird sound it makesmade must have been what the Admiral had heard. The bell rang at that moment and they commented on the beauty of its sound. Noland guessed this meant the island was inhabited.
As they went into the jungle, they ran into Seto. The Doctor diagnosed Seto's weird stains as Tree Fever and Noland ordered the crew to get some conine to administer to the boy and the whole crew. They arrived at the Shandia town and noted with sadness that even the crop was infected and the whole village was sick.
At the Sacrificial Altar, Mousse was brought by boat to the altar while a priest was delivering a prayer for the village to be saved from the disease. As Mousse was tied down on the altar, Kashigami swam to the altar and hovered over the girl. As the giant snake was about to eat Mousse, Noland jumped in the water, climbed the altar, and beheaded Kashigami, much to thr horror of the Shandia who had come to pray to the Gods for the safety of their loved ones. Noland comforted a crying Mousse but the villagers were infuriated and screamed for both of them to be killed to appease the Gods that surely must be furious at one of them having been killed. Noland's crew was worried for him and, encouraged by the cries of the crowd, Kalgara swam to the altar and attacked Noland.
Noland introduced himself as an explorer from the North Sea and tried to defend himself to Kalgara who wanted to hear nothing of it. While Noland fought him to a standstill, Kalgara threw a knife at Mousse and encouraged her to kill herself to appease the Gods. Noland stopped her but Kalgara speared him from behind.
Noland's crew had been taken hostage by some of Kalgara's warriors who were holding knives to their throats. Kalgara ranted that any intruders were banned from the island and that on top of it Noland had killed a god and his life alone would not atone for this. They must all be killed. An infuriated Noland dismissed those notions of sacrifice as a disgrace and lectured Kalgara about progress. He said that if their Gods cared about the Shandia's lives, then those rituals were the complete opposite of what they would want. Noland told the villagers he would ""lift the curse"" and cure the disease but he needed time and if he ended up not keeping his word, then they should feel free to do whatever they wanted to him and his crew. In exchange, if he did save them, they must swear never to hold human sacrifices again.
The villagers were furious and Kalgara dismissed him and startdd to attack him once more. The Shandia Chief interrupted and told them to give Noland a chance. He had until tomorrow evening to cure them all and then his fate shall be decided.
Noland's crew were locked into a cage and worried about getting killed tomorrow. Mousse who was in a nearby cage asked about Noland. They explained to her that he was a skilled explorer and botanist traveling around the seas to find new species for his research but got into trouble every once in a while.
A council was gathered and upset at the chief for giving Noland a chance. The chief pointed out there was nothing to lose by waiting. Kalgara said that if he felt the slightest bit of threat from Noland, he would not wait until tomorrow to kill him. The chief said that while he could not hear the words of the Gods, he knew to recognize the words of a wise man. Kalgara stormed out and ran into Seto outside who said he was cured and wondered what Noland meant when he mentioned ""progress"".
In the forest, Noland was happy to have found a Kona Tree.
The ground suddenly started shaking and the villagers thought this was an earthquake to punish them for what had happened. After it stopped, Kalgara went onto a high rock to assess the damage and saw part of the forest was sinking. He spotted Noland injured and stuck in a crevice and comescame nearby to gloat that God had punished Noland himself. Noland and Kalgara exchanged some unpleasant words until Noland said he had to get out of that spot he was stuck into and hurry to the village. Kalgara said he wanted to stay and watch him try to do that.","Usopp, Sanji, Enel, Wyper, Aisa, Shandia Chief (flashback), Kalgara, Mont Blanc Noland, Chiya, Mousse, Herb, Seto, Honner, Kashigami, Coburn",
Episode 188,Released from Disgrace! The Tears of the Great Warrior!!,28-Mar-04,"In the flashback: Mont Blanc Noland and Kalgara are enjoying themselves, as well as the villagers and Noland's crew, but that changes one day, as the villagers start hating their new friends.","This episode is the continuation of the flashback from 400 years ago.
The villagers are still enraged by the earthquake that they think was punishment for Noland killing Kashigami. They gather around the cage in which Noland's crew is held prisoner and prepare to execute them to appease the Gods. However, Seto sits down in front of the cage to block the way - to the villagers' dismay - and tells them they should be ashamed of themselves.
In the forest, Noland is still stuck in the crevice as Kalgara gloats and tells him this is the punishment of the Gods and his crew will be dead by the end of the evening. Noland struggles to get out and Kalgara is impressed by his efforts.
The sun is setting and the crew as well as Mousse are being led to the Sacrificial Altar. Kalgara is still gloating at Noland but Noland is defiant and confronts Kalgara about the moral disgrace that are human sacrifices. Kalgara beats Noland up while defending his people's traditions. The villagers are getting ready to burn the crew and Mousse.
Noland continues to guilt Kalgara about their rituals and Kalgara reveals that he believes so strongly in them that Mousse is actually his daughter and he was ready to let her die because of his faith in the Priest's words. Both men hear a noise in the forest and it is another large python - although smaller than Kashigami. Kalgara speculates it must be Kashigami's son that came to avenge his father. Noland explains to Kalgara that the Tree Fever struck his own village 60 years ago and that they did discover a cure called conine that he can extract from the bark of the Kona Tree  that he had gone to get in the forest and still holds in his hand. Kalgara is obviously troubled and Noland shames him about stepping in the way of progress and letting his village die of the disease. The python suddenly attacks Noland but Kalgara strikes and kills it. Kalgara is anguished about what he has done (since he believes the python is a aod) but tearfully asks Noland whether he can really save his village.
Noland's crew administer the cure, to the delight of the villagers Kalgara is also tearingly reunited with his daughter. Noland recovers from his injuries as well and everybody is happy and getting along. Later Kalgara and Noland's crew are walking in the forest and encounter a mini-version of the earlier python - Kashigami's grandson. Kalgara and Noland are getting along great to the crew's astonishment. They comment on how happy Noland looks.
Kalgara leads Noland and his crew to a spot and the bell starts ringing. They go down some stairs and they are in Shandora. Noland and everyone are amazed. The city is all covered in gold and the rest of the villagers is there as well ringing the bell. Kalgara tells the crew about Shandora. 
Noland's crew rushes to get some treasure and Noland tries to stop them. But Kalgara says it is fine, and except for the belfry they can take what they want as a thank you for saving the village. They never cared about the Gold. What they were protecting was a special stone on which a Poneglyph is written. Kalgara says no one knows how to read it but their ancestors fought to protect it and they want to honor their ancestors by protecting this stone that symbolizes their victory. Kalgara also explains that the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell allows the souls of their ancestors to come back to their Land safely and to tell them the villagers are still here protecting Shandora. That's why they call it the Fire of Shandora. Noland comments on hearing the ringing of the bell in the storm. Both men comment on the snake growing up to be as big as his forebears. Kalgara invites Noland to stay as long as they want and Noland thanks him saying he wants to finish ridding the village of the Tree Fever and to collect some plant samples as well. Some members of the crew tell Noland there was an Eternal Pose and a map in the treasure. The map shows the island and Kalgara mentions that Shandora means ""Right eye of the Skull"" as the island is shaped like a skull. Later, Noland shows the curious villagers a pumpkin the crew had grown in the greenhouse on their ship and gives them some seeds to grow it themselves.
The villagers, upset and angry about something the crew has done, refuse to talk to the crew. They are ""Killers of Gods"" regardless of whether they saved the villagers or not. The Chief tells them not to confront them since they are leaving soon anyway. Noland and his crew happily arrive at the village but everyone shuns them and goes home. Seto tells Noland that Kalgara does not want to see him and reminds them they should leave soon. Noland's crew is puzzled. Kalgara is seen sulking in Shandora and tells a villager he will kill Noland if he sees him.
Later on the beach the crew notices the bell hasn't been rung today for the first time since they have been on the island. Noland tells the crew they have two more days of work to do on the island and then they will leave. He reminisces about Kalgara offering him Muse's hand in marriage (that he turned down on account of his own family back home) and then Seto's hostile word and runs to Shandora to confront Kalgara. He wants to know what they have done but Kalgara launches a spear at Noland grazing his cheek and asks him if he came here to die and to leave. Noland is stunned.","Seto, Honner, Kalgara, Mont Blanc Noland, Mousse, Coburn, Herb, Nola",
Episode 189,"Eternal Friendship!
The Bell of Oath Echoes Throughout the Giant Ocean!!",4-Apr-04,"The cause of the hatred is discovered and explained; Noland has cut down a grove of special trees on the island which the villagers say house every ancestor and are sacred enough to protect with their lives. Meanwhile, Kalgara vows to meet Mont Blanc Noland again.","The flashback of Mont Blanc Noland continues.
Noland's crew is sitting down around a campfire discussing the recent events and how upset Noland is at the villagers suddenly turning their back on him. They mention they are leaving tomorrow and that the bell still has not been rung.
Noland is nearby remembering Kalgara's words of anger to him when they met in Shandora earlier. Mousse is also shown looking pensively at the night sky from her bedroom window.
The Doctor of Noland's crew is drinking alone while his comrades are sleeping and bemoans the situation when a cloaked Mousse appears behind him and startles him.
Kalgara is looking at a grove of cut-down trees and curses Noland. He angrily rants about what Noland has done.
Mousse explains to the Doctor that those trees were sacred to them as they believe the souls brought back by the Golden Bell reside in those trees and watch over the Shandia. The Doctor sadly acknowledges the crew chopped them down and Mousse tells him the only reason the villagers did not attack them is out of regard for their earlier help with the Tree Fever. Mousse says even if they did not know about the significance of the trees, the villagers will never forgive them but she wanted them to at least know why they were angry. 
The next day on Noland's boat, the Doctor reports to Noland what Mousse said and Noland is appalled and feels guilty. He understands the villagers because the bell now has lost its purpose because of them. Noland then tells the crew they are leaving the treasure behind and the crew is appalled.
At the village someone mentions Noland and his crew leaving and some villagers look grumpily conflicted. Mousse runs into town and starts rumbling out of breath to her father Kalgara. She asks what they would do if they knew one tree was infected and was going to poison the rest of the island and starts to cry. Mousse begs her father to go talk to the crew before they leave and tells him he will regret it later if he does not go say goodbye to the best friend he ever had. Mousse flashbacks to the rest of her earlier conversation with the Doctor who explains that the grove in question was already dead and infected with Tree Fever. As the plague infects both people and plants, the crew had to chop them down to prevent those trees from infecting the rest of the island and killing the villagers again.
Seto and the villagers are stunned to hear they did it to protect them. Kalgara rushes to the beach to beg Noland for forgiveness.
At the beach, the pile of treasure has been left behind. Some of Noland's crew are upset. Noland addresses them and tells them it is time to go back home to the Kingdom of Lvneel. Full of regrets and guilt, Kalgara is still running to reach the beach.
As the boat sets sail, the Golden Bell starts ringing again. Noland hears it and is shocked. We see Seto and the other villagers are all crying and ringing the bell hoping Noland and his crew will hear it before they go. Then Kalgara burst onto the beach and screams Noland's name. He remembers moments of their friendship and cries. He screams at Noland to come back again. He says he will wait for Noland's return and keep ringing the bell so that Noland's crew can find their way back even in a bad storm.  Noland is also in tears and swear he will come back and they shall meet again.
Back at the Kingdom of Lvneel, the narrator tells about Mont Blanc Noland and his tales that no one knows whether they are true. They show him returning from his trip and telling the King about Shandora.
Five years later, the King says Mary Geoise has approved Noland's return trip to Shandora but instead of his usual crew, the King himself and his army will accompany Noland there. Noland seems pleased.
Back on Jaya Island, a grown-up Seto accompanies Kalgara to their daily ring of the bell. They greet Nola, the now slightly grown python who is Kashigami's grandson and who now lives in the ruins. Seto wonders when Noland will be back but Kalgara is patient and says he will come back some time but he understands his family is in the North Seas. Kalgara trust that if they keep ringing the bell, Noland will be back.
However at that moment the Southbirds starts screaming and the sky becomes very dark. Kalgara and Seto rush back to the village to protect it. The ground starts breaking and we see Mont Blanc Cricket's now-house being torn in the middle by the island break. Rocks are flying and we see the Knock Up Stream bursting out of the middle of the island.
Noland followed by the King and his army is now on the island looking at the half-house in despair wondering where the rest of the island has gone. The King attacks Noland and accuses him of deceiving him about the gold. Noland worries about Kalgara and wants to hear the Fire of Shandora to know his friend is OK.
Noland's execution back at Lvneel is about to begin. A crowd has gathered and Noland retells them the story of Jaya Island and the City of Gold. One of the King's advisers invite a member of Noland's crew to hear what he has to say. That man appears and tells the crowd and the King this is all a lie. The crowd is shocked and thinks Noland is a horrible man. Some actual members of Noland's crew step forward from the crowd and scream the man is an impostor and try to tell people of Kalgara but they are restrained. Noland is about to be executed and the crowd heckles him and calls him a liar while his men cry.
The Shandia part of Jaya is shown being burst into the sky by the Knock Up Stream and impaling itself on Giant Jack. As the Golden Bell flies in the sky, it rings and the people on Angel Island hear it in awe. A man who is the then-God of Skypiea telling his enforcers this is the birth of a Holy Land and that he should live on this Vearth.
Back in the Shandia village, everybody is in shock. There are many injured. God appears in the village with his enforcers and Kalgara and some of his men attack them to protect the land. 
As he is about to be put to death, Noland wonder where Kalgara is. As he is about to attack God, Kalgara worries about what Noland will think when he comes back to Jaya and does not find his friend there. He reiterates his hope that they can meet again.
Back to Wyper's flashback, the Village Chief tells young Wyper that Kalgara kept thinking of Noland all through that battle and hoped that if he could just ring the Golden Bell once more, he could let his friend know he is alive and thinking of him. Unfortunately, he never got to do it. Some time later, a ship from the Blue Sea went up to Skypiea and told the Shandia what had happened to Noland. Kalgara continued to be a great warrior in the sky but always regretted never being able to tell his feelings to his friend. Young Wyper wonders if ringing the bell now would still reach Noland and let him know of Kalgara's friendship. Maybe, says the Chief ...
Back to the present, Aisa is tugging at Wyper to leave as the island is being destroyed. Wyper finally speaks and curses Enel.
Enel looks at the destruction and is enjoying it. 
McKinley is yelling at people to hurry the evacuation but the lightning is striking some boats as well. Some White Berets inform McKinley there are casualties and McKinley orders everyone to the boats. They will get care there. As McKinley worries about Conis, a huge lightning bolt strikes Angel Island.
Back on the Going Merry, Conis is still silently praying.
At the bottom of Giant Jack, Robin comments that the ark will soon be at the top and she tells Gan Fall that what Enel wants is the Golden Bell hidden at the top. Wyper overhears.
Enel mocks the fleeing angels and strikes at the boats with lightning. At Heaven's Gate some of the fleeing angels look in horror as a hole opens in the White White Sea above them and some boats fall down. Enel also destroys his former home of God's Shrine with lightning strikes and strikes Shandora below as well. Enel mentions the only thing on this land that interests him is the Golden Belfry. But he frowns when he realizes he hears two ""voices"" approaching.
Nami is on her Waver a bit lower on the stalk from Luffy trying to keep up with him.
Luffy (with his ball behind him) is still running, expressing concern for Nami and swearing Enel won't put his hands on the Golden Bell.","Honner, Nola, Mont Blanc Noland, Mousse, Kalgara, Seto, Herb, Coburn, Aruyutayan V, Ubau, Shandia Chief, Wyper, Aisa, Enel, McKinley, Conis, Su, Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Sanji (K.O.), Gan Fall, Pierre (K.O.), Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper (K.O.), Nami, Monkey D.

Luffy decides to go and ring the golden bell before Enel takes it away.,"The scene starts with the group at the foot of the beanstalk with Wyper asking about the golden bell. Usopp is completely lost as Wyper continues by asking Robin where the bell is. Usopp begs to get out in fear for his life as Robin tells Wyper it's at the top of the beanstalk. Robin says the ruins spoke of the city landing on Giant Jack which sent the bell flying high up into the clouds.
Then there is a quick flash back of the crew walking through the forest. Then Enel speaks of finally having the bell as Luffy catches up to Enel so much so that Enel notices him and sends a lightning bolt at Luffy which he avoids, but it causes giant jack to split causing Luffy to fall with it. Wyper tries to climb the beanstalk but notices it has been cut. ""Great warrior Kalgara longs to hear its sound... that is our goal,"" says Wyper. Luffy tries to climb the stalk but is struggling to hang on as Enel mocks him saying he'll show him something miraculous.
Then Luffy uses the golden ball and his rubber ability ""Gomu Gomu Yo-Yo"" to fling himself up but ends up breaking the vine and falling down. Nami runs over him to the surprise of Luffy as he thought he'd succeeded in flying up higher.
The scene cuts to the city dwellers questioning a giant ball that Nami explains is a thunderhead bursting to scene with giant thunder bolts. With the group seeing this and Robin saying a thunder cloud shaped like a sphere. The city dwellers try and make it to the ocean, and it cuts to Enel saying the Ark Maxim has truly made him omniscient as the ball falls upon the city. Enel exclaims ""Raigo!"" as the ball explodes on top of the city with the survivors looking back wondering if the White Berets have survived and realizing their homeland is gone forever.
Enel laughs and says ""this is what the sky should look like"" then the scene cuts to a terrified Usopp and horrified Gan Fall.  Next it cuts to Conis on the Going Merry saying she wants to take them back to the blue sea. Then it cuts to Luffy and Nami with Luffy saying he has some unfinished business with Nami saying ""your life is more important than gold"". Luffy then says he won't die asking Nami if she'd seen it, the City of Gold, ""it wasn't a lie, the old timer's ancestor."" Then it cuts to a flashback with Cricket and Luffy says he has to ring the bell so that the old timer and the monkeys would hear it and stop searching the ocean floor. It cuts to a flashback with the crew and Luffy explaining his intentions. Then to the crew with Zoro saying when Luffy says he's going to do something he'll do it.
Luffy stands exhausted at the cut base of the beanstalk then grabs Enel's ship, and Enel easily kicks him off falling back down. Nami refuses to join him, and Enel exclaims all will perish sending everything back to the way it's supposed to be. This infuriates Luffy, but Enel easily stops him from climbing up again, this doesn't stop Luffy from trying but once again Enel stops him saying ""it's beyond anyone from stopping me now"".

Luffy falls but his will doesn't waver. Down where the others are, they get a message written on a leaf telling them to cut down the beanstalk from the west. The people from Skypiea tremble in fear as they look up at the ark surrounded in clouds. It focuses on Enel where he is talking to himself about destroying the land with Raigou so he can set out for the Fairy Vearth.
Robin, Usopp, Gan Fall, and Zoro look in wonder at the thunderclouds Enel has created that are even bigger than the last one, doubting that they will get off the island in time. Then Nami, staring at the thunderclouds with Luffy, decides she won't leave because Luffy can't steer the waver. Usopp explains their plan as if it's crazy. Lightning strikes where they are and Wyper gets Aisa out of the way just in time. Usopp grabs Sanji with the help of Robin and they run before the next bolt hits them. Zoro then makes the decision that they should get away from the beanstalk in which everyone agrees non-verbally. When they are on the vearth, Zoro runs towards the beanstalk dodging bolts while the others wonder if he will make it. Being Zoro, he makes it and slices one part of the beanstalk down with one sword. Unfortunately, he gets struck down with lightning before he can cut the other part leaving both parts still standing.
Wyper complains about them getting in the way and protests that he, not Luffy, should ring the bell because it is the Great Warrior's will. Usopp decides that with his powers he can knock down the rest of the bean stalk and tells Robin to look after their fallen comrades.

Conis and the villagers look on in terror but realize after the smoke clears that Upper Yard is still standing. Gan Fall realizes that the Vearth is just that powerful and questions why they were so blind for 400 years. Usopp tries to get everyone out of the way as the beanstalk appears to fall on them. Luffy gets closer, but Enel is unimpressed and uses Raigo. Luffy gets closer and the waver cuts off, but Luffy continues to jump towards Enel. The beanstalk finally falls all the way to the ground and Luffy uses the ball of gold with his Gomu Gomu Hanabi saying that Enel ruined the weather once they got there.
Enel realizes the gold ball on Luffy's arm is a natural conductor and tries to drop the thunder ball before Luffy can discharge it.

Luffy gets himself free and uses the golden ball and the twisted arm from earlier to hit Enel, sending him into the golden bell.  ","Usopp, Aisa, Nico Robin, Gan Fall, Monkey D.

Episode 193,"The War Draws to a Close!
Ringing Far and Wide, the Proud Fantasia",23-May-04,"The 400-year war on Sky Island comes to an end. Mont Blanc Cricket and the Masira Brothers hear the Golden Bell ringing and realize that the Gold City was always in the sky. Enel, who was thrown to the Blue Sea heads out to the Fairy Vearth (the Moon). The Sky People (both Skypieans and Shandia) celebrate the end of the war with a great bonfire.","Luffy delivers to Enel his finishing blow with this golden ball arm, causing the Golden Bell to ring and fall and the golden ball to shatter. The ringing is heard by Cricket and the Saruyama Alliance all the way from Jaya, and all the other people in Sky Island. The Straw Hats rejoice upon hearing the beautiful sound of the bell.
Having confirmed the existence of Sky Island, Cricket surmises that the ""giants"" they see in the cumuloregalis clouds were just shadows of the Sky People living in Sky Island. He then cries in relief knowing the Straw Hats are safe.
Back in Skypiea, the Golden Bell falls into the sky ocean, followed by Enel and his Ark Maxim. The Skypieans watch as these sink into the sky ocean. The promise to ring the bell has finally been fulfilled after 400 years. Luffy lies down and wonders if the old man and the others heard it, to which Nami replies that she's sure they did.
Everyone involved in the battle are now being treated or are recuperating. Chopper goes to Wyper to treat his wounds. Zoro, Usopp and Sanji think about how the City of Gold was only a city of gold by name since they were not able to find any treasure within it, that it was too bad that the Golden Bell fell to the sky ocean, and they weren't able to get some gold, thus continuing their journey in poverty. Usopp isn't too torn up about it since he would much rather have the dials than gold since these can't be found in the Blue Sea.
Luffy, Nami, Conis and Su get back to the group carrying a huge sack of food they found in the priests' food storage on their way back through the forest. Conis' father, Pagaya, who she believed to have died protecting her, appears behind them telling her that he is alive. He said that he found himself in the White Sea after being knocked off. He also updated every one of how the evacuees are returning to the White-White Sea via restored Milky Roads and that since Angel Island is no more, everyone is headed to the Upper Yard.
Gan Fall goes to rescue those who Enel forced to work for him for 6 years to build Maxim and they are reunited with their families. The Shandorians discuss the events, consulting the Shandorian Chief if the 400-year rift could so easily be mended.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats have finished off all the food and Nami suggests that they return to their ship so they can sleep comfortably tonight. However, Luffy and Usopp are disappointed by this statement, telling her that this comment disqualifies her from being a pirate, hinting that they still need to get ""that"" thing that they came for. Enel is seen on Maxim sailing across the sky ocean, going to ""where God should be"" which is to the Fairy Vearth (the moon).
Wyper gains consciousness. He sees Gan Fall, Conis and the Shandorian Chief, prompting him to ask if they were captured by Skypieans. The Shandorian Chief tells him that there is no distinction between those who have been injured in battle. Wyper grows restless, remembering that they still need to find and protect the Golden Bell. He then hears the sound of drums and sees a huge fire outside his tent and assumes that they were announcing a battle. The Shandorian Chief calms him down and tells him to wait and see how things are turning out. Gan Fall then encourages him to look outside and see that instead of a battle, a celebration between Skypieans and Shandorians is taking place. Wyper sees this and smiles.","Monkey D.

Episode 194,I Have Come Here! The Weaving of the Poneglyphs,6-Jun-04,"Robin deciphers the Poneglyphs on the Golden Bell and realizes how to find the Rio Poneglyph. She also discovers that Gol D. Roger left a message written in the same language as the Poneglyph. Gan Fall informs her that Roger could hear the voice of all things but not actually read the letters, and he had once visited Skypiea. The grateful Shandia offer a broken golden pillar from the Belfry as an attempt to repay them. Soon afterwards, the Straw Hat Pirates find a sizable amount of gold in Nola's stomach and begin to leave Skypiea, after mistaking the cloth covered pillar for a giant cannon.","We see the aftermath of the party——people resting being exhausted after partying for four days. Luffy is running around trying not to wake people looking for his Crew. He finds Nami, wakes her up and asks her to wake the others so they can steal the gold and run. They get into a silly argument which ends up waking most of the sleeping Sky People. Afterwards, Luffy proceeds to tell them his plan.
In the morning, a Shandorian reports to the Shandorian Chief that they have found the Golden Bell and that it is hanging on to Giant Jack, but it might not hold. He asks for help from every able-bodied warrior to go to the western shore to pull the bell up from the sky ocean. The Shandorians try to pull up the bell but are initially unsuccessful. Skypieans then arrive to help and manage to pull up the bell.
Meanwhile Usopp is initiating trade with the Sky People, offering them rubber bands and metal sheets in exchange for dials. His trade went well, and he is excited to use the dials he obtained to enhance Nami's Clima-Tact and his weapon. Zoro is training by cutting stone while waiting for the others. Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Nami are inside Nola, retrieving the treasure inside its belly. Robin is wandering outside, investigating the Shandia ruins.
After the Golden Bell is recovered, the Sky People prop it up and discover that one of its columns has broken off. They see the Poneglyph at its base and wonder what the ancient writings say. The Shandorian Chief says that being an ancient text, it is impossible for them to read it. Robin appears and proceeds to read the writings out loud for the Sky People to hear. She tells them that the Poneglyph mentions Poseidon, an ancient weapon named after a god and that it gives its whereabouts. She is disappointed as this was not what she wanted to find.
As she is walking away, a Shandorian points out ancient writing engraved on the side of the bell which she missed. She reads the writing as ""Gol D. Roger"" which shocks her. It continues to say ""I made it here and I will guide this passage all the way to the farthest ends of the earth. The stormiest seas will not stop me. - Pirate Gol D. Roger."" She surmises that the Pirate King came to the Sky Island but is confused as to the meaning of those words. She wonders how he was able to understand and use the ancient language. Gan Fall tells Robin that he met Roger when he came to Sky Island over twenty years ago.
Robin tells the Shandorian Chief that the duty of the Poneglyph that the Shandorians have been protecting for centuries has been fulfilled since Roger has already taken the text of the Poneglyph here to the island where the ""real Poneglyph"" may be located. The Shandorian Chief is moved to tears since this means their duty has also already been fulfilled, that they don't have to fight any longer and that the war is finally over. Robin states that she too must carry on fulfilling her duty to take the text on Poneglyphs she has read all the way to Laugh Tale.
Gan Fall tells Robin that Luffy reminds him of Roger and that he finds him very interesting. Robin agrees and says that she finds him interesting as well. The Shandorian Chief, grateful for the Straw Hats help, wants to give them gold by offering the Belfry's broken column. The Sky People wrap up the column to carry to the Straw Hats.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats are growing impatient waiting for Robin. As she approaches the crew, they see the wrapped up broken golden column and mistake it for a huge cannon and make a run for it. The Sky People give chase trying to give them their gift.","Nola, Monkey D.

Episode 195,"Now Heading Towards the Blue Sea!!
Memories of an Interwoven Finale",13-Jun-04,"The Straw Hat Pirates are heading to Cloud End with the help of Pagaya and Conis. As they descend the free fall, Conis calls an Octopus Balloon to have them safely land in the Blue Sea. The Golden Bell rings as the Straw Hat Pirates are going down to the sea, meaning that they are welcome in Skypiea any time, and that the Skypieans are deeply thankful for what they did. When the ship finally rests on the sea, problems appear, as the ship has landed in a Marine base.","The Straw Hats (minus Nami who is already at the ship) are seen running away from what they thought was a huge cannon. The Sky People are disappointed that they were not able to give them their gift and that they were not able to express their gratitude, although Aisa says that she was able to thank them before they left.
Meanwhile in Upper Yard, Wyper declares that while their ancient duty as Shandorians has already been fulfilled, the fire of Shandora will never die. The Shandorian Chief asks Gan Fall to reprise his role as their leader. He initially declines this request since he still has to fulfill his duty as Sky Knight, but the Chief argues that their land no longer has any use for that role. He continues to say that what they need, instead, is someone who is kind and just who can govern their land, and that duty is best suited for him. Gan Fall suggests that the Shandorian Chief lead the Sky People since Shandora originally belonged to the Shandorians. The Chief says that that means nothing now, and that Vearth should be shared among all the peoples in Sky Island, and that he is the best person who can lead them. All of the Sky People then cry out for him to be their leader, which he then accepts.
The Straw Hats are sailing across the White-White Sea towards Cloud End, preparing to leave Sky Island. They are escorted by Pagaya, Conis and Su on their waver. They reach Cloud End and start descending the Milky Road which will lead them to the Blue Sea. As they freefall back to the Blue Sea, Conis summons an Octopus Balloon to soften their landing. It grabs onto the Going Merry and stops their freefall. It is then that the Sky People ring the Golden Bell so that their departing heroes know how much they are appreciated and are welcome back anytime.
Back on Jaya, Cricket tells the Saruyama Alliance that he is calling off the search for the City of Gold since they have confirmed that it has been in the sky the whole time. He thanks them for believing in his dream and that he has decided to leave the island. The Masira and Shoujou ask if he's leaving the alliance, to which he answers them with a question of which dream were they going to pursue next, implying that he wasn't leaving them.
On the Going Merry, Luffy, Sanji, Usopp and Chopper discuss what they were going to do with the treasure they found in Shandora. Nami tells them they can't buy everything they want because they'll end up broke and that they have to ensure to land safely first. Robin calls Nami's attention and asks her where they are headed. Nami realizes that they have been blown off-course by an air current, and that because of the Octopus, they are unable to use the sails to control the ship.
The descent taking longer than expected, the crew grows bored and Luffy decides to hop on top of the Octopus and jump around its head like a trampoline. Sanji notices that the Octopus is shrinking so he tries to stop Luffy from playing. Unfortunately, the Octopus loses air, and they start to freefall towards the sea. To stop them from falling, Usopp goes to the bottom of their ship and attaches breathe dials to help the ship float. The ship slows down momentarily, however, the Octopus loses all of its air, and the ship comes crashing down and lands onto the sea. Surprisingly, the ship survives the fall. After they land, they hear sirens and see spotlights trained on the Merry.","Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Sanji, Nico Robin, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 196,Emergency Official Announcement! Notorious Pirate Ship Infiltration!,20-Jun-04,The Marines are convinced the Going Merry is a ghost ship after it crashes inside their fortress from above. The crew members are scattered around the premises.,"To open Marines are heard singing 'I don't know but I've been told' while patrolling on a bridge. One of them says that he has heard a rumor about how other marines think that their base has gotten soft because they haven't seen action. Another vehemently argued that that is not true.
Meanwhile a damaged marine warship was being fixed at a dock where workers were complaining that the ship would take a week to fix while another states that they had 3 days. In the background Mekao is seen drinking, muttering that in the old days people used to treat their ships with respect. He then gasped and dropped his bottle as he saw the Going Merry falling from the sky and shouted for everyone to look.
The ship is shown falling and Marines sounded the alarm saying that they are under attack from the sky. The Marines then get to their stations and then see the Going Merry and associate it with the Straw Hat Pirates.
A lower ranking marine then goes and tells Lt. Commander Drake that pirates have invaded. He asks where Comm. Jonathan is, to which he replies he doesn't know.
Jonathan was then shown fishing Usopps's sniper goggles out of the water as he stared at the Going Merry while the Marines tell the Straw hats that resistance is futile and they can't escape.
In the kitchen, two cooks were talking about the commotion outside and get slapped with a ladle by the head chef Jessica who yelled at them for wasting time that they could be spent on preparing food for the soldiers at the base.
Jonathan was then shown walking into his office where Drake was waiting for him. Drake asked where he had been as Jonathan threw his fishing rod and hat into Drake's arms saying he didn't catch anything. Drake begins to tell him if he is absent all the time it causes problems, but was stopped by Jonathan. A marine comes to report that all the eyewitnesses claim they saw a ghost and that the ship must be a ghost ship. Drake berated the marine to report something of significance and to only come back with something useful.
The Marines started investigating the ship and Jonathan noticed odd things for a 'ghost ship' such as the tea being set out and the books being well kept. Then a marine informs him of treasure that they had found on board. A south bird makes its eerie noise to which Jonathan tells people to calm down as it is just a silly looking bird, to which the bird attacks him and flies away. He told his men to keep up the good work and to continue investigating the 'ghost ship'.
Jonathan, walking with other higher ranked marines, begins to connect the dots about the coffee flavor and color being similar to Jaya coffee, the gold on the ship and the legend of a gold city on Jaya, along with the South Bird saying that its not a ghost ship and that the other men were 'too green' to deal with the situation so he kept up the ghost ship idea. Drake offered to start a searching party which Jonathan immediately shuts down and says to begin searching at first light and warned them to check everyone as they could camouflage themselves to look like marines.
Chopper is shown hiding behind a tree wondering where everyone is. Zoro surfaces in the water and dodges an oncoming ship, while Nami is shown hiding her waver in a field of tall grass. Sanji, hiding in a tree, hopes that Nami and Robin are okay when a patrolling marine shoots at him, claiming he saw a light. As they walk away Sanji got mad saying he can't even smoke in peace to himself. Luffy is seen trying to pick a passage that will lead him to meat wishing he had Chopper with him to smell it for him. Usopp and Robin are shown together as Usopp finds his googles. Robin uses her Devil Fruit to spy on the marines who are talking about the ship being a ghost ship and how the gold must be cursed.
Jonathan, reclining in his office, is seen thinking about who is on board and what jobs they have.
Chopper, to get away from Marines, throws trash out a window to distract them. Nami is wondering where they landed and Robin tells Usopp the main priority is to find out how to escape. Luffy is then shown literally shadowing a marine while Sanji thinks about how stupid he is being and how he never takes things seriously.
To end Jonathan is shown wondering why the Straw Hats are at the base and that he will just have to wait and see.","Jonathan, Mekao, Drake, Shinpachi, Billy, Jessica, Tom, Tony Tony Chopper, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp, Nico Robin",

Suddenly two marine ships reach the G-8 base and ask to enter to heal wounded people on board. Jonathan allows it.
Nami wanders in the base disguised as a marine. She finds Zoro who is walking with no destination and without doing anything to hide. Nami, then, takes his swords and throws them on a bush difficult to reach, just to make him busy and stopping him. Sanji and Luffy disguise themselves as marine cooks and enter in the kitchen. There they are mistaken for the two new cooks arrived from the headquarters, while the two real cooks have been confused by Nami's instructions. The two men are welcomed coldly by Jessica, the head chef, who wants to check what they can do. Sanji shows his ability, higher that the real cooks', while Luffy only eats what was already prepared. Both of them are accepted as the new cooks.

In the cells, Zoro was about to take a nap when Drake shows up and demands for Zoro's guards to open the cell. Drake begins asking questions as to how many of the crew there are, how did they infiltrate the stronghold and such. Zoro truthfully replies that they came from heaven via an octopus balloon. Drake does not believe him and warns him not to underestimate the marines.
Meanwhile, Nami is assigned by the boss of the janitors to clean the dojo, and Chopper overhears that Zoro has been captured. Some Marines find him, and they run past the closet that Nami hides in. Chopper reaches a locked door but breaks the lock and manages to hide behind a crate full of deer antlers. Some doctors carry the crate outside with Chopper trapped inside. He is carried to the medical room, which is staffed with a single, inexperienced doctor. Outside, Nami is now dressed in a nurse uniform that she found in the closet. Several nurses run past, and drags Nami to the infirmary, stating that it was an emergency. Chopper realizes that he in in the infirmary, and wonders if the doctor is going to be okay.
Nami is assigned with the task of treating the Marines' wounds. On the other side of the room, Dr. Kobato faints at the sight of blood. Chopper decides to take the doctor's place and directs the treatment, wearing disguises. He meets up with Nami and asks what she is doing. Kobato wakes up then collapses again at the thought of operations. She revealed that she cannot bear the sight of suffering or wounded people, but Chopper encourages her to save the wounded. She stands up and makes her way to the operating room. Nami tries to persuade Chopper to escape while they can, but he says that his number one priority is to save people. The three of them proceeds to operate on the patients.
Meanwhile, Drake is notified that an unidentified doctor is performing surgeries. He suspects that it is one of the Straw Hat pirates, and Zoro thinks that it is Chopper. Drake proceeds to the operating room and demands to ask Dr. Kobato a few questions. She in turn demands that he leaves after saying that the only people in the room were ones who dedicated their lives to saving people. He complies but orders the guards to watch the room. They finish the operations, and Chopper shrinks down to his usual size. However, Dr. Kobato is oblivious to this.
In the kitchen, Sanji is wondering how to escape. He states that the reason they were stuck there was because of Luffy not doing anything. Jessica arrives and asks if he is finished with the onions yet and wants them to cut to the next three hundred onions.

However, neither of them know where the jail is, thus they assume it is in the suspicious looking island surrounded by water. Major Sheppard is captured by the marines and held in the same cell as the Straw Hat Crew, as Robin stole his uniform previously and the Marine mistook him for an intruder. Usopp takes the chance to pretend he is their comrade, assuring the marines won't let him out.
Robin is in the library searching for a way out of the base, noticing that the Marines are watching her closely. Vice Admiral Jonathan decides that they will have to lead the Straw Hats to the prison in order to capture them. Later, Shipwright Mekao talks to Usopp in the prison, telling him the repairs he did to the Going Merry weren't good enough, and that sooner or later the mast would snap. They talk about the Straw Hat's time in Skypiea, much to Lieutenant Commander Drake's annoyance. However, the Marines force Mekao out after he tells Usopp he might know who mysteriously fixed the Going Merry in Skypiea.
Meanwhile, Luffy and Sanji attempt to infiltrate the prison, concerned about how deserted the path was. They race down, despite the obvious trap. Luffy discovers the bars are made out of Seastone, whist Sanji attempts to kick down the bars, also discovering that they are practically unbreakable.

Meanwhile, Luffy's group is running around the base, being chased by Marines. In trying to escape, they end up in what seems like a dead-end at the side of the mountain and meet Vice Admiral Jonathan, who happened to be at the balcony of his office. Luffy tells Jonathan that he has freed his crewmates and declares that they were going to escape the base. This makes Jonathan laugh, asking him if he really thinks he can escape Navarone Island with their treasure, to which Luffy replies that they are pirates and that the Marines can't catch them. Suddenly a huge cannon is fires at Luffy's group, and they run back inside the base.
Instead of going in hot pursuit of the Straw Hats, Jonathan decides to set a trap for them in Dock 88, where the Going Merry is moored, as he knows this is where they will surely go. He tasks Lieutenant Commander Drake to set up the ambush in Dock 88 and since it will take Drake some time to arrive at said dock, he orders Unit 55 to slow the Straw Hats down to stall for time. He stations them at the bridge which is the only way to get to the ship.
Meanwhile, in the base clinic, an alarm can be heard. Nami and Chopper overhear a guard informing Dr. Kobato that they were in Code Red due to a jailbreak. Nami is worried since she and Chopper were still separated from the Crew. They deduce that Luffy must have rescued Zoro and Usopp and that they are probably on their way to the Merry. They decide that they have to get out of the clinic to meet up with the rest of the Crew.
Before Nami and Chopper can leave, the guard tells Dr. Kobato that one of the pirates have disguised themselves as a doctor. She panics and locks the door to her clinic. She does not realize that the pirates being pertained to are Nami and Chopper and is worried for their safety. However, the two inform her that they are the pirates and that they need her to tell them the location of the dock where their ship is. Dr. Kobato, terrified, screams and then faints which causes the guards to break down the door and rush inside. Improvising, Nami pretends to have also been attacked and lies down next to the doctor, all tied up, while Chopper hides. Nami tells the guards that ""the pirates"" have escaped through the air ducts.
When Dr. Kobato regains consciousness, she tries to scream, but Nami calms her down. Chopper and Nami are about to leave, when Dr. Kobato tells them that even though they are pirates, they were the ones who helped her see what it truly means to be a doctor and that she wants to help them find their ship. Chopper is worried that they might get her in trouble for helping pirates, so she tells them that if they get caught, she will just pretend to be a hostage. Since her father works at the docks, Dr. Kobato is able to determine where their ship might be.
Meanwhile, Luffy's group arrives at the bridge leading to Dock 88. Seeing that the bridge is unguarded, they gather that it must be a trap. They decide that they don't care and go ahead and cross it. Unit 55 block their path and have them surrounded from all sides. Luffy's group easily defeats them but, in the process, Luffy destroys the bridge, and they all fall into the bay. Even with the damage caused, Jonathan in pleased with the result since it bought them the time they needed to set up the ambush in Dock 88. Luffy's group heads to the dock, straight into the trap, seemingly cornered. Luffy is shot with a Seastone net and is incapacitated.

Episode 202,Breaking Through the Siege! The Going Merry is Recovered!,12-Sep-04,"The crew meets at the docks and are surrounded by Marines. Using Nami as their fake hostage, they trick the Marines into letting them back on the Going Merry.","The episode starts with the events prior to the arrival of Nami's group into Dock 88. Drake's men bombard Luffy's group with gun fire but he easily repels the bullets using his Devil Fruit powers. The Marines resort to using what seem like bazookas seeing that their guns are ineffective. They have fired instead, flash bombs to subdue the pirates which stings their eyes. Drake then has his Sword Unit attack the Straw Hats as they are still trying to recover from the effects of the flash bomb. The Crew are able to fight off the attacks. Luffy is then shot with a Seastone net and is instantly incapacitated. Drake demands that they surrender and tells them that while their Marine base policy is to take prisoners alive, he will not hesitate to change this policy if he is met with any resistance. With Luffy in a weakened state, Sanji, Zoro and Usopp seem to be unable to resist the overwhelming number of the Marines in the dock and consider surrendering.
Just as the Marines are about to capture them, Nami and Dr. Kobato, with Chopper still hidden under the sheets of the hospital bed, arrive at the dock. The Marines notice that Dr. Kobato is with the pirates and hesitate to attack, asking those who just arrived to identify themselves. Dr. Kobato then pretends to be a hostage and screams in feigned terror. She hints at Nami of her plan and in turn, Nami also pretends to be a nurse held hostage by Chopper, now in his Heavy Point form. Chopper acts like a tough and ruthless pirate and demands that the Marines stand down and let them board their ship.
Drake gives in and orders his men to stand down in return for the release of the ""hostages."" Zoro releases Luffy from the Seastone net but Luffy remains weak. Mekao, Dr. Kobato's father, watches as this is going on. He says that while he isn't too worried about his daughter being with the pirates since he can tell if she really is upset, he is still worried that the Marines may inadvertently hurt her.
Drake ""accommodates"" the Straw Hats and lets them board their ship, but Zoro senses another trap. He silently tells Luffy to sling them to their ship on his signal. A Marine covertly rescues Dr. Kobato and another also tries to rescue Nami, but she punches the Marine. This was their signal to rush towards the ship. Luffy slings the Crew onto the Merry. Mekao, with the safety of his daughter in mind, aides the pirates in their escape by releasing the Going Merry from the dock into the bay. Thinking that the Straw Hats are holding the ""nurse"" Nami as hostage, Drake orders them not to shoot at them, but instead to just give them warning shots. As the ship sails away, the Marines scope out the ship and notice Nami giving the crew orders and is in being held hostage. They realize that she is actually part of the Straw Hats.
Inside the base, Robin is leaving the library, as she is finished researching about the base, when she is stopped by marines. She subdues them and then makes her escape to the ship. She swings from the base onto the Merry and the Crew is finally reunited. She gives Nami a map of Navarone Island which she obtained in the library.
The Marines start shooting cannons at the Merry and start giving chase using warships. Nami refers to the map and sees the only way out of the base is the Sea Gate, to which they head. She notices that the water is too shallow and that the map doesn't make sense. They head to the Sea Gate anyway and try to think of a plan to open the gate. The Marines continue their barrage on the Merry while the Straw Hats don't have a way to retaliate since the Marines have confiscated all their cannon balls. Luffy devises a plan and catches all the cannon balls shot at them with his Gomu Gomu no Fusen ability and redirects them towards the gate. Just as the gate explodes, Nami realizes that if the Marines took all their cannon balls, they must have also taken the treasure they found on Skypiea.","Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, Monkey D.

However, he is easily defeated by Robin, who uses her Devil Fruit power to point the bazooka at the ground and fire it, launching it into the air. The Straw Hats escape the vault.
Meanwhile, Nami drops off Sanji at the ship before pursuing the Straw Hats herself. She overhears Marines discussing how the Straw Hats have fled towards the mountains.
The Straw Hats ask Kobato and Mekao where the gold is stored. Mekao points them to a cliff face and says that the treasure was likely at the top. However, Mekao also warns that Jonathan would very likely use the gold to bait the Straw Hats into a trap.
At the top of the cliff, Nami joins the others by riding the Waver up the cliff. They deduce that the only way for Jonathan to be able to trap them is if he placed the gold near his office. So, Luffy and Nami head towards Jonathan's office, while the others go to the edge of the water for Sanji to pick them up.
Luffy and Nami manage to find the window of Jonathan's office and break in. Jonathan, who was waiting in there the whole time, is surprised. The gold is in his office. Luffy takes the gold, but reinforcements arrive, and he is captured in the seastone net. However, because the Marines were using guns, Nami defeats all the Marines by using the Clima-Tact to create lightning. They take the gold and escape.
Nami and Luffy are picked up by the Going Merry, which has been disguised as a Marine ship. Meanwhile, Shepherd mocks Jonathan for letting the Straw Hats escape. He then orders the Marines to intercept the Straw Hats at the gate. The Marines then notice that one of the Marine ships was really the Going Merry.

So, when Luffy commands the ship to go full speed ahead, a hole was torn in the hull by the rocks on the harbor floor.
The harbor eventually reaches a very low tide, rendering the ship unable to move. Jonathan gloats via megaphone how he had captured the Straw Hat Pirates.
So, the Straw Hat Pirates launch their plan; they use Usopp's Impact Dial to launch the ship into the air, then uses an Octopus Balloon inflated with Breath and Flame Dials to float in the air. Jonathan orders his men to fire a ""warning shot"" at the balloon. However, Shepherd also aims for the balloon with his bazooka, only to instead miss and shoot down the Marines' cannon.
Jonathan accepts that the Straw Hat Pirates have won, and that they have successfully escaped G-8. He commands Drake to ceasefire. Shepherd, who is angry that the Straw Hats escaped, threatens to have G-8 decommissioned, but is punched by Jessica. Jonathan explains that the pirate encounter was a bonding experience for the Marines, so he is not upset that the pirates escaped.

In Mock Town, Donquixote Doflamingo perches from a column and uses his powers on Bellamy and Sarquiss as punishment for being defeated by Luffy prior to his journey to Skypiea. Bellamy begs Doflamingo to give him another chance, but Doflamingo concludes that Bellamy and his crew are obsolete to him and uses his puppetry to force Sarquiss to slash Bellamy, although he survives. In the seas the Straw Hats notice a ship lacking its sails without its captain or navigator. The ship then sails into a giant wave which destroys the ship. The crew then come across Long Ring Long Land, however it is too plain for their (particularly Sanji's) tastes. Luffy, Usopp and Chopper immediately de-board and start to act childish as usual and explore the island. The trio see long animals and come across two tall bamboos whose top couldn't be seen. Suddenly the bamboos start moving and one hits Luffy. Luffy gets excited and breaks the bamboo. Then falls an old man named Tonjit who has a horse named Shelly. Tonjit says that he made the world's tallest stilts and after going up, he couldn't come down for 10 years due to fear.

The second round prepares to start.","The Straw Hat Pirates overcame the various forms of sabotage at the hands of the Foxy Pirates. The Straw Hat Pirates now must traverse a coral reef. They find that the reef is filled with currents. While the Cutie Wagon was pushed back, the Straw Hats' boats manage to overcome the currents.
However, Foxy fires a smokescreen arrow that renders the Straw Hats unable to see. They manage to overcome this sabotage too, but they approach the Long RIng, a giant whirlpool. They use the Impact Dial to fly over the whirlpool. However, the Well Whatever landed on the Long Cape and broke, disqualifying it from the game.
Only the Barrel Tiger and Cutie Wagon remain. The Cutie Wagon finally overcomes the coral reef by using Capote's Two-Fish Engine technique. Meanwhile, the Barrel Tiger clears the Long Breaking Waves obstacle and Foxy's Fake Sign. So, Foxy disguises himself as an elderly woman and asks the Barrel Tiger to stop and help her. Nami refuses and continues on.
Nami then passes through Foxy's fake finish line, but Porsche falls for the trick and stops. Nami finally finds the real finish line and approaches it, but Foxy uses his Noro Noro no Mi powers to slow down the Barrel Tiger, allowing the Cutie Wagon to win.
Foxy explains that his powers allow him to emit particles that can slow down an object. He then selects Tony Tony Chopper as his new crewmate as the prize. Chopper tearfully accepts joining the Foxy Pirates.
Because Chopper was intended to participate in the second event, and that the Straw Hats cannot change their order, they will only have two participants for the second event: Zoro and Sanji. Foxy explains the second event, the ""Groggy Ring,"" where one player on each team would be the ball that would have to go through the other team's ring.
Foxy introduces his teammates, the Groggy Monsters: Hamburg, Pickles and Big Pan.

The Groggy Monsters cheat by using weapons, and the referee pretends not to see anything. After taking a beating, Sanji and Zoro finally agree to work together for 10 seconds in order to win.","For the Straw Hat's next event, they must win a game of Groggy Ring to get Chopper back. Sanji and Zoro must work together to defeat the Groggy Monsters. The referee introduces the two teams, Sanji and Zoro as the two guys who sabotaged the Foxy Pirate's teams in the first event, and introduced the Groggy Monsters as their most powerful Groggy Ring squad.
The Groggy Monsters are three giants named Hamburg, Pickles, and Big Pan. After introducing Zoro as the 60,000,000 belly man, Pickles says he was wondering what kind of opponents warranted them coming out and playing. The Groggy Monsters appear to think Sanji and Zoro are no match for them.
The referee comes out and says the field positions are decided by a coin toss. He then quickly flips the coin, and Hamburg immediately says tails. The referee then asks Zoro and Sanji which side they chose. Sanji replies saying there is only one side left to choose, so heads. After they respond the referee shows the coin he flipped, revealing tails. He then smirks and gives an evil laugh. He turns to the Groggy Monsters and ask them if they want field or ball. Hamburg, the leader responds Ball. The announcer then says in an excited voice over the PA that the Groggy Monsters have chosen to receive the ball. He then says that Sanji from the Straw Hat team must go to his opponents' mid-circle.
Zoro and Sanji then start arguing over where to stand, and who is the ball. They play rock paper scissors to decide who is the Ballman. Zoro wins, but Sanji argues against it, saying that Zoro threw the last paper late. Nami gets frustrated and tells Sanji that the ball looks good on him. As they walk to the starting line the referee tells Roronoa Zoro that there is a no weapons policy and to take off his katanas.
The Groggy Monsters decide to rush Zoro and Sanji and crush them. The announcer then tells the teams that there is no time limit and the first point wins. Pickles rushes forward to attack Sanji, but he easily jumps over him. Sanji then tries to attack the opposing team's Ballman, Big Pan. He slips on Big Pan's arms because he is part loach and their skin is slippery. Big Pan hits Sanji sending him flying to Hamburg in order to score a goal. Roronoa Zoro tries to catch Sanji from going into the goal but Pickles knocks him out of the way. Then Hamburg catches Sanji and throws him to the goal. Pickles catches Sanji and throws him to the goal. Before Sanji reaches the goal Zoro throws Pickles toward Sanji and Sanji kicks Hamburg preventing him from entering the goal and loosing the game.
Sanji and Roronoa Zoro continuously argue and fight. They both say they do not need any help to win by themselves. Big Pan uses the disarray to try and crush Sanji and Roronoa Zoro by crushing them. Big Pan is breaking the rules by using weapons on his feet. Sanji gets mad and kicks the ref, because the referee is not doing anything about Big Pan using weapons. This causes him to get a yellow card.
All three of the Groggy Monsters return with lots of weapons. Roronoa Zoro and Sanji get beaten up by all of them. They are beaten to an inch of their life because they will not work together. After several minutes of harsh beatings, Roronoa Zoro and Sanji are shown to be barley conscious. The episode ends with Roronoa Zoro telling Sanji that they should work together for 10 seconds to win.","Chuchun, Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Hamburg, Pickles, Big Pan, Monkey D.

Episode 212,Rapid-Fire Red Cards! Groggy Ring,5-Dec-04,"The bickering rivals Sanji and Zoro manage to overcome the opposing team by working together for a few seconds. Luffy chooses Tonjit's horse, Shelly, over Chopper.","The episode begins with Itomimizu narrating that Sanji and Zoro have been defeated, but is interrupted when the two Straw Hats suddenly stand up. The remaining Straw Hat members cheer for them as Itomimizu goes on to doubt if Zoro and Sanji have any strength left. Foxy then orders a ""Monster Burger"" from the Groggy Monsters, which causes the Foxy Pirates to go into a shock. The Straw Hats in the audience wonder what it could mean. The Foxy Pirates then start to cheer as Hamburg, Pickles and Big Pan pull out weapons, claiming to grind, slice and crush Zoro and Sanji into a ""monster burger"". Itomimizu says that this is clearly against the rules, but the referee is stretching and not watching the field. Luffy is seen getting enraged at the referee, but he is being held back by Nami and Usopp. 
The Groggy Monsters start their attack with Hamburg aiming straight at Sanji, but he defeats Hamburg easily and sends him flying right in between the pans that Big Pan was crushing together. Pickles, angered at Hamburg's defeat, charges at Sanji, but is stopped by Zoro. Pickles tries to attack Zoro with his swords, but Zoro sends him flying with Mutouryuu: Tatsumaki. Pickles flies spinning at Big Pan and accidentally slices him in the chest. As Big Pan starts to fall over, Sanji runs behind him and makes him stand back up with Anti-Manner Kick Course. Zoro then starts running towards Big Pan with Pickles standing in between them, but Sanji quickly kicks him out of the way and straight into the referee. The referee tries to issue a red card, but he notices that both his cards and whistle are gone before passing out. It is then revealed that Nami stole them from him. Back in the field, Zoro is seen running at Sanji, and at first, Itomimizu thinks they are fighting again, but Zoro merely jumps on Sanji's leg, who sends him flying at Big Pan with Armée de l'Air Power Shoot. Zoro grabs Big Pan by his mouth and proceeds to land his head into the goal, much to the shock of the Foxy Pirates.
The watching Straw Hats start to cheer, as do some of the Foxy Pirates, before Foxy scolds them for praising the enemy. The referee then wakes up as Nami persuades him to blow the whistle, and he does, not knowing of the situation, and Itomimizu announces that the game is over and the Straw Hats are the winners as the Straw Hats cheer for Zoro and Sanji. 
Itomimizu explains that now that the Straw Hats have won, they can either choose a member of the Foxy Pirates or take their flag. Luffy says that he's already decided, and several Foxy Pirates immediately start to think that Luffy is going to pick them as Chopper silently pleads Luffy to hurry. Just as Luffy is about to say who he chooses, Nami interrupts him. She tells Luffy that Foxy is probably going to meddle in the next game and suggests that Luffy choose Foxy in their team. She proceeds to say that even if they'd choose Chopper now, they could still lose him in the next game if the Foxy Pirates win, and taking Foxy out now would be the best way to ensure Chopper's return to the crew. The Foxy Pirates are shocked at this and call it the ""peanut strategy"", claiming that the Straw Hats are unfair if they do this. After Zoro agrees with them and says that Nami is in the wrong, she snaps at the Foxy Pirates and warns them not to get cocky. Zoro is seen on the ground with a huge lump on his head, suggesting that Nami punched him as well. 
Itomimizu then says that Luffy is still free to choose anyone he wants from the Foxy Pirates. The pirates who thought they were going to be picked still think so, but this time Foxy is also thinking that Luffy might pick him. Then Robin points out that if they choose Foxy now, he would become their crew member, and the rest of the Straw Hats immediately say they don't want him, which shocks Foxy. He becomes depressed and his crew gathers around to comfort and encourage him. He cheers up at first, but when Sanji tells him to cut it, he becomes depressed again.
Itomimizu then steers the conversation back to where it was: who will Luffy choose? Chopper holds back his tears as Luffy says that he's going to take something back. Chopper cheers up, thinking Luffy is going to choose him, but then Luffy shouts out Shelly's name. Nami and Usopp start complaining and pulling at Luffy's face. Tonjit and Shelly appear in front of the Straw Hats and Luffy tells Tonjit he got Shelly back from the Foxy Pirates for him. Tonjit expresses concern over Zoro and Sanji's beat up appearances, thanks Luffy for what he did and then asks if Chopper is okay with this. Chopper seems crushed, but Luffy tells him to wait and promises that he will definitely win the next round and get him back. Luffy asks Chopper if he has a problem with it, to which Chopper says he doesn't. The episode ends with each of the Straw Hats looking forward to the next game.

He then brings Chopper back to the Straw Hat crew. Foxy, declaring that there should be no draws in the Pirate world, asks for a three-coin rematch. Luffy accepts, and Robin and Sanji question his motives for doing so, wondering if he's trying to find a shipwright. Nami and Usopp are angered with Luffy but also terrified, convinced that the Foxy Pirates will take them, until some Foxy crewmates tell them otherwise.
Hit & Dead ball, the first event in the three-coin match, is essentially a game of dodgeball. The goal is to out all of the opposing team's players. Whichever team loses all of their members first loses the entire first round. The game has a long history and thus also has many rules. Nami assumes the rules are made to give Foxy's team an advantage, but realizes everyone must play fair thanks to strict consequences and a change of referees. The Foxy Pirates greatly outnumber the Straw Hats, making it seem as if the Straw hats are at a disadvantage. Two players from Foxy's team as well as Luffy and Chopper step up, preparing for a double jump start. The two opposers attack, but Luffy and Chopper evade them, grab the balls, and aim for Foxy, who is hit in the face. The referee calls it a safe since according to the rule book, face hits don't count. The balls are then passed to Zoro and Sanji, who knock out a total of 18 players. The balls are passed back to Luffy, who disqualifies 10 players, and Chopper, whose ball is stopped by Hamburg.
Big Pan of the Foxy Pirates has both balls, but ends up disqualifying Usopp and 22 players from his own team. There are few remaining on Foxy's team, and it doesn't seem as if the Straw Hats have much of a disadvantage anymore. Hamburg and Foxy decide to use a secret weapon to win, but then Robin outs Hamburg. A referee tries to declare it a safe, before being corrected and reprimanded. A ball is passed to Sanji, but some women trick him into giving them the ball and letting them get him out. Foxy brings out the secret weapon, ""Dead Hit"" cannon. Robin notes that according to the rule book, Dead Hit is the only weapon allowed.
Porche and Foxy try to trick Zoro, who in turn cuts the ball with his bare hands to avoid getting hit. He is then disqualified, as cutting the ball is against the rules. The only players left on the field are Luffy, Chopper, and Foxy. Luffy dodges Foxy's next ball, but Chopper notices that it bounces back and shields him. He is assumed to be out until he reveals that it was a face hit, and earns the support of the audience. Although the referee agrees, Chopper went out of bounds and is therefore disqualified. Luffy goes to thank Chopper, and then proceeds with the game. He stretches out to throw his ball at Dead Hit, but while doing so, the ball is taking by Porche. She and the rest of the spectators shuffle the real ball with fake ones, making it impossible to tell which is which. Luffy attempts to catch all the balls thrown at him in case one is real, but Foxy launches his own ball as well. Nami tells Luffy to let it hit his face as his arms are full, but ends up catching it with his mouth and swallowing it. The referee declares that Luffy is now also disqualified. According to the rulebook, swallowing balls is not allowed. The Straw Hats are outraged, but the rule is real. The Foxy Pirates won the first round of the Davy Back Fight.","Foxy, Hamburg, Nami, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji, Roronoa Zoro, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

Foxy uses a trapdoor that takes Luffy out of bounds into the ocean. However, Luffy manages to grab onto the ship and narrowly avoid falling into the ocean. Foxy then locks Luffy into a room, then rigs the outside floor with spikes; Luffy would break out the door but fall into the lethal spikes. However, Luffy instead uses a cannon to break down the door.
Foxy locks himself in the nurse's office. He then disguises himself as a nurse. He manages to punch Luffy before fleeing further. His second disguise as a chef also allows him to attack Luffy with another Kyubi Rush. This move makes Luffy fly into another room.

When they wake up, Zoro reveals that he regained his memory when the seahorse coughed up his memory. Sanji was mad that Zoro still looked scary after regaining his memory. Zoro then jumps into the lake to chase the seahorse. After Zoro catches it, the seahorse uses his last resort: he sprays a gas into the air that makes the Straw Hats hallucinate people from their past memories (Bell-mere, Hiriluk, Kaya, Kuina, Zeff, Ace, and Shanks), then their past enemies (Arlong, Wapol, Kuro, Krieg, Crocodile, and Enel). The seahorse then steals the Straw Hats' memories, causing it to inflate and be able to float; it becomes a Sennenryu.

On the Going Merry, the Straw Hat Pirates find themselves dealing with a storm that keeps growing larger. Luffy is seen sliding across the deck on top of a barrel. Usopp and Zoro are trying to keep the main mast in place. Chopper fears that it will snap, but Sanji eases his stress, stating that Nami will get them out of it.

Foxy tries using is Devil Fruit powers, but it has no effect. Luffy, seeing their predicament, sends his rubber arm to grab them, but they hit the side of the Going Merry. Foxy's life boat gets destroyed.
In the kitchen, the three sit wrapped around thick blankets and Foxy becomes sad at how bad his life is turning out and believes he would be better off dead. Sanji tries to raise their spirits with some soup, only for Foxy to criticize his cooking. Porche goes looking for Chopper to share her soup with. When Chopper hears her voice, he freezes and uses his powers to change in horn point.
The next day, Usopp, Luffy and Hamburg are fishing. Foxy goes on the deck, searching for food. He accidentally mistakes Nami's orange hair for an orange and she beats him.

Foxy then launches a Slow Slow Beam, but it is ricocheted back to him by a shield of swords. The Straw Hats are absolutely surprised at the event. Kiba's men go on the offensive and attack Foxy, throwing a barrage of punches at him. Hamburg uses his club and makes his way through. Kiba then grabs Porche and holds a knife towards her throat and threatens to slit her throat if Hamburg does not surrender his weapon.

Luffy busts through one of the pit's walls, and the Straw Hats are confronted with Foxy, who has taken up an obvious disguise that Luffy nonetheless fails to see through. Eventually Sanji sets him on the right track, and Foxy makes a getaway covered by his powers. Luffy, Nami and Usopp chase after him, while Sanji and Zoro are frozen in a compromising position.
Nami and Usopp find a door with a message that only men can enter. When they both go in, they find that it is a passage over the Sexy Foxy's brig, filled with the Foxy Pirates' troublemakers that have not seen a woman in a long time. Nami finds it too uncomfortable to cross, so Usopp reasons that the prisoners will be vulnerable to light after their time in the dark brig, and throws a flash-bang. Nami is able to make it through, although Usopp trips and falls, and the prisoners hold him in place.
Luffy and Nami arrive in a large atrium, where Foxy, Porche and Hamburg attack them with the Gorilla Puncher 13 and Donkey Kicker 18. Inspired by Luffy calling for water after he burns his hand on the machine's fist, Nami uses Thunderstorm Tempo to put out the fires, allowing Luffy to smash the Gorilla Puncher and use Gomu Gomu no Spinning Top to collide it with the other machine and defeat them both. Afterward, the Straw Hats and Foxy convene on the deck and agree to end hostilities. Foxy then tearfully asks his crew if they will still accept him, which they enthusiastically confirm. However, as the Straw Hats return to their own ship, Foxy privately tells his subordinates that they must defeat Luffy or they will be stuck flying his ridiculous flag forever.
The Straw Hats disembark on an island, where Sanji starts a barbeque. Foxy, Porche, and Hamburg attack in a large crab-shaped submarine which they are confident will be mistaken for an ordinary crab, and their prediction comes true as Luffy grabs the sub's leg and tries to bring it to the barbeque. When its pilots try to shake him off, Luffy angrily retaliates and slams the submarine into the beach, causing it to explode. Porche calls a backup ship and the three return to the Sexy Foxy.
The Straw Hats decide to venture into the island's jungle to search for medicinal herbs. They are confused by what looks like a bicycle track along the jungle path. Eventually, they come to a clearing with what looks to be a mushroom growing from a rock. Chopper goes to investigate and is struck out from behind the rock. When the others follow, they see that Chopper actually disturbed the sleep of a mysterious man, the sight of whom sends Robin into a panic. She explains that the man is one of the strongest individuals enlisted in the Marines: the Admiral Aokiji. He responds by saying that she's grown into a beautiful woman, seeming to recognize her.","Foxy, Porche, Hamburg, Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 227,Marine High Admiral Aokiji! The Threat of the Greatest Power,27-Mar-05,"The man they met, Marine Admiral Aokiji, appears to be incredibly lazy. He first displays his Devil's Fruit ability by freezing the sea so some deserted people can get off the island. Unfortunately, he's determined to catch Robin, Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro attack but they seem to be no match.","The crew is shocked to see Robin panicking at the sight of the man they met, and immediately faced him, ready to attack. She tells the crew that the man is marine Admiral Aokiji one of the three Admirals: Akainu, Aokiji, and Kizaru; one of the World Government's three greatest power. Usopp questions why Aokiji is there but Aokiji ignored him and turned towards Nami and tells her that she is a ""super-babe"", which angers Sanji and Usopp.
Aokiji explains to them that he is only out for a walk. The crew questions Robin if she had mistaken Aokiji for another man, because of the way he talks, as his speeches are messed up, and forgot what he was supposed to say. Aokiji defends himself that they should not judge people by their appearance and that his motto is ""Justice with laziness"", to which both Sanji and Usopp agree. Aokiji then lies down saying that he is tired, which made Usopp question why he was sleeping while standing up, and says that he doesn't have plans to capture them and that he came there only to check up on Robin's whereabouts after the events of the Arabasta incident. He also tells them that he will report Robin being with the Straw Hats to headquarters, saying that the crew's total bounty will change from Luffy and Zoro's bounty of 160,000,000 to 239,000,000 because of Robin's bounty of 79,000,000 though Aokiji has trouble summing it up. Luffy tries to attack Aokiji but is held back by Usopp and Sanji. Aokiji tells him that he will not do anything when a group of people who are stranded on the island after their ship was wrecked.
Chopper tends to their injuries while Sanji cooks the food that he and Usopp have gathered. While eating, Nami asks what happened to them to which they replied that on their way home from their tour, a giant frog doing a crawl stroke collided with their boat. The group drifted to the island and waited for help when they saw a man riding a bicycle in the middle of the sea, which Usopp found absurd. Aokiji admitted that it was him, the man riding the bicycle. Luffy then remembered that he was supposed to attack Aokiji, but Sanji and Usopp stops him again, with Aokiji stating that he is only taking a walk. Luffy keeps arguing with Aokiji saying that he should go.
Aokiji decides that it is time to go and that he will help the group of stranded people get off the island, telling them to get ready and that there is a populated island nearby. Luffy warns the group that Aokiji is a marine, which prompt a man to ask what the problem is, and makes Luffy realize that normally marines are the good guys and pirates are the bad guys. Usopp and Chopper question how the group will get off the island when there are no boats nearby. Aokiji tells them not to worry, to which Robin replied that it is possible because of his powers.
When the group is almost done preparing, they, along with everyone else, went to the shore. The Straw Hats help them secure their food and supplies, with Sanji saying that there is enough food for ten people. Luffy and Nami are relieved when Aokiji is really telling the truth when he said that he will help them, but Luffy still wonders how he will help them. Aokiji proceeds to the shore, tells everyone to stand back, and puts his hand in the water while everyone watches in anticipation. Suddenly, a Sea King appears, startling everyone, and Usopp and Luffy shouts at Aokiji to run and watch out, however, Aokiji just sat there still, ignoring everyone else and the beast. Luffy and Zoro prepares to attack when Aokiji activates his power, Ice Age, ultimately freezing the sea along with the Sea King, shocking everyone. Aokiji returns to retrieve his coat while stating that the ice should last a week, and telling the group to follow the ice path in order to reach a populated island in 4 days. Overcoming their shock, the group thanks Aokiji, saying that he made a miracle.
After everything is set, the group is ready to head out, and the Straw Hats see the off. The group thanks the Straw Hats for their help, with Luffy and the others telling them to take care. The crew have fun on the ice for a while and return back, when they saw Aokiji sitting on the ground watching them. Luffy asks why he is staring, and Aokiji replied that he is like his grandfather. Upon hearing him mention this, Luffy starts to sweat while Aokiji tells them that long ago, his grandfather used to cause a lot of trouble for him. He also tells them that he came for Robin and to have a look at Luffy, and says that he should just kill them off right there. He explains that even if the World Government is still ignoring them, if they study their backgrounds and past deeds, though small in group, they will be troublesome for them. Aokiji continues that what makes their crew dangerous is Nico Robin. Luffy angrily shouts at Aokiji that he will beat him up, but Aokiji ignored him and proceeds to tell them that Robin's bounty not only shows her strength, but also reflects on the threat she poses to the World Government. Aokiji, albeit mockingly, compliments how well she did to survive as a child by betraying her partners and using them as tools, surviving the underworld concerned with only herself, and asks her if the crew is her next hiding place.
Sanji is angered by this asking him what his grudge against Robin is, to which Aokiji answers that he has no grudge but explains them that if there is any connection between him and Robin, it is because he failed to capture her once. He tells them that when they take her in, they will soon regret it, telling them that every organization that she have been was completely destroyed except herself. The crew defends Robin saying that they do not care about the past and that she is their friend. The Admiral states that she has become popular with the group, triggering Robin to use her devil fruit ability to grab hold of him. Aokiji calmly says that he is disappointed at her and tells her that he overestimated her and that he thought she was a more intelligent woman, but Robin uses her Treinta Fleur: Cluth, and shatters Aokiji's body like ice, leaving the crew shocked. However the crew is shocked more when the ice reforms and turns into Aokiji.
Aokiji calmly stands up, and cuts a few grass and throws them in the air. He blows at it, freezing it in the process, in order to make an Ice Saber, and swings it at Robin. As it was about to hit, Zoro intercepted it and Sanji kicks the saber out of Aokiji's hand using his Slice Shoot. Luffy went in to attack using his Gomu Gomu no Pistol, but before his attack connects, Aokiji suddenly grabs Zoro's arm and Sanji's leg. When Luffy's attack connects, Aokiji uses his powers to freeze his own body, along with Luffy's fist, Zoro's arm, and Sanji's leg, leaving the rest of the crew shocked and scared. With all three down, Chopper voice his concern about their frozen body parts, saying that if they do not treat it fast, they will get frostbite and that their tissues will rot. Nami shouts at Robin to run away, however she is ignored. Aokiji tells Robin that even if she had found some good friends, she'd still be the same, which Robin tries to tell him that he is wrong, and that she is no longer the same before. However, before Robin could finish what she was saying, Aokiji grabs her in a bear hug and proceeds to freeze his body, ultimately freezing her own as well, while the crew watches in horror.","Nico Robin, Aokiji, Nami, Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Ultimately they survive the encounter with the Admiral, and eventually continue on their journey to Water 7.","Aokiji tries to crush the frozen Robin underfoot, but Luffy slides her out of the way to Usopp and Chopper. Luffy urges them to return her to the ship to thaw her, determined to fight the Admiral himself. Once there, Chopper and Usopp run the shower over her to slowly thaw her, but Chopper is uncertain if he'll be able to resuscitate her once thawed. Nami arrives shortly after with Zoro and Sanji. The latter two thaw their frozen limbs in the sea before returning to the battle to help Luffy, while Nami assists Chopper and Usopp in thawing and reviving Robin.
Aokiji tells Luffy that the world is better off if Robin is not saved, but Luffy refuses to leave his crew behind. Luffy kicks him in the air and attempts Gomu Gomu no Storm, but Aokiji breaks himself apart and reconstitutes around Luffy, freezing him with Ice Time and placing his frozen body on the ground. Aokiji contemplates the fight, and thinks Luffy challenged him one-on-one to save his crew, perhaps even not concerned about winning. As Zoro and Sanji approach, Aokiji leaves Luffy's frozen body and departs, saying he owes the pirate for defeating Crocodile. Although he briefly mentions a message from Smoker (but only that it was ""something stupid""), Luffy can't hear him anyway. Before he bikes across the sea, he notes that the Straw Hat Pirates will be heading to Water 7 next, getting them close to World Government headquarters.
Some time later, Chopper comes up from the sick bay and tells the crew tearfully that Robin and Luffy's hearts have resumed beating. Sanji goes to prepare a meal for them, while Chopper tells the others to let them recover for a bit. Usopp collapses, confiding in Zoro that he's unsure how long he can take the growing power of the enemies they are facing. They remain at the deserted island for four days while they recover before setting sail again.
A week after their encounter with Aokiji, Sanji lets the crew sample a dish of potato paille while Luffy jokes about having been frozen. Robin finally appears, having taken a bit longer to recover than Luffy, and asks for some coffee. Luffy soon finds Yokozuna, that frog that the shipwreck survivors from the previous island told them about that was able to swim with a crawl stroke instead of a normal frog swimming motion. He insists on following it, manually changing course and paddling the Going Merry to Nami's chagrin, hoping to catch and eat the frog. Suddenly, they find themselves near a lighthouse, and by what looks like a railroad crossbuck, with the lights and bells going off. As a train whistle sounds, something approaches them very fast, causing Nami to order full reverse in a panic.","Aokiji, Monkey D.

Luffy shows Iceburg the letter from Kokoro, to which Iceburg rips up the letter, then says that Kaku has already assessed the damage and repair price.
Usopp then realizes that his money had been stolen. The Franky Family members laugh as they escape with their money.","Roronoa Zoro, Zambai, Kiev, Tamagon, Schollzo, Kop, Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp, Nami, Ishigo Shitemanna, Kaku, Iceburg, Sanji, Nico Robin, Disguised Man, Kalifa, Tyrannosaurus",
Episode 232,Galley-La Company! The Magnificent Dock #1,15-May-05,"Paulie makes his debut when he retrieves Usopp's stolen money as he runs from debt collectors. Kalifa shows Luffy, Nami, and Usopp around Dock 1 and tells them how Iceburg founded the Galley-La Company. While Usopp's attention is focused on the sight of a cannon being prepared for a galleon, the Franky Family sneaks up from behind and mugs him. A dock worker finds his suitcases and brings them back to Luffy and Nami, but Usopp is nowhere to be found. Kaku returns from the Going Merry and tells them that their keel is irreparably damaged.","As Usopp continues to pursue the Franky Family, the latter was stopped by Paulie (a shipwright foreman in dock #1) as he was escaping from debt collectors. After realizing the money in the yagara he stole from the Franky Family, he tried to run away with the money and Luffy tried to stop him but Lucci stopped Luffy and said he'd do it, it was shown that Kaku is now checking the floorboard of Merry. As Lucci successfully stopped Paulie from taking the money, Franky Family was introduced to Usopp, Nami, and Luffy as demolition workers and that they are bounty hunters on the side. After the money was returned to the Straw Hats, Lucci and Paulie engage in a fight that did not last long and finally the Straw hats was permitted to enter Dock #1.
Inside the dock #1, as Kalifa states how Galley La company was built, Luffy on the other hand was shown asking Iceburg to join their crew, Iceburg then ask if they have no shipwright in the crew which Luffy proudly admitted and stated that they went to Water 7 to find a shipwright and to make him join their crew, which lead them again to the subject of Luffy asking Iceburg to be one of their crew, which was rejected right away by Iceburg saying that he is the mayor of Water 7.
Iceburg suddenly asked if Nico Robin is really their crewmate, Luffy confirmed and said that Robin is a smart woman. Usopp was seen admiring craftsman work when he was suddenly attacked, again  by the Franky Family. On the other hand, as Chopper tries to find Robin, he found Sanji in stead.
Kaku finally returned and Zoro was shown in Merry's deck remembering the conversation with Kaku. Back to Luffy and Nami, one of the craftsmen of Galley la company (GLC) brought back the cases that Usopp was carrying. As Luffy and Nami go on and on about how they want Merry repaired, and that they would pay enough, as they were stopped by Kaku and said that the Straw hats have been having some tremendous journey. Luffy said that it was true and told them about their adventures and asked that they don't believe him, only to be answered by Kaku that he believes Luffy because Merry's scar from battles are too deep, and said that Merry was beyond repair even with the GLC's capability, Merry's chances of reaching the next island would be zero.
In the last scene, Zoro was shown looking at Merry, asking her if it's true that she can no longer sail.","Paulie, Kalifa, Iceburg, Usopp, Monkey D. Luffy, Kiev, Schollzo, Tamagon, Tyrannosaurus, Nami, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Kaku, Roronoa Zoro, Zambai, Kop, Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji",
Episode 233,The Pirate Kidnapping Incident and the Pirate Ship Waits for Death!,22-May-05,"Luffy refuses to believe that Galley-La Company cannot repair the Going Merry. The two soon realize that not only is Usopp missing now, but that the two briefcases that were returned to them are empty! Nami decides to head to the Franky House and finds Usopp on the way in a pitiful state. As she heads back to the ship for help, Usopp goes to the Franky House himself.","The episode starts off with Sanji and Chopper sailing back to the merry after failing to find Robin. Sanji questions if Robin not returning has something to do with what Aokiji told them about Robin. They agree if she's ok she will eventually turn up at the Going Merry.
The episode shifts to Luffy and Nami who learn that the Merry is irreparable. Luffy and Nami refuse to accept it but they are informed that the ""keel"" of the ship has been damaged too bad to be repaired. (The keel is the bottom part of the boat; it holds the boat together and is basically its backbone.) Luffy and Nami ask if they can build an exact replica, but the carpenters say it's impossible because of the differences in wood type and material across islands. They will need an entirely new ship.
Government officials show up to talk to Iceberg while Nami and Luffy hide. While carrying the suitcases Luffy realizes two are lighter. They open them up and see that 200 million beri is gone. Luffy swears to find the money and runs off in an unknown direction. Nami meanwhile asks where the Franky hideout is and heads in that direction.
One the way to the Franky hideout, Nami finds Usopp. It appears he has been beaten up and left on the sidewalk. He cries that he is the one responsible for letting the money slip away and is worried about facing the crew after screwing up. Nami tells him the hideout isn't far away and tells him to stay put. She has to return the money to the Merry first before getting Usopp help. The scene cuts to the Franky family celebrating such a big heist. As they celebrate the door blows up, and behind it is Usopp with his sling shot.","Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin (flashback), Disguised Man (flashback), Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 234,Rescuing a Crewmate! The Raid on the Franky House,5-Jun-05,"Luffy, Sanji, Zoro, and Chopper follow Usopp's bloody trail to the Franky House where they find him passed out in front. The four of them challenge the Franky Family only to find out that their real target, Franky himself, is gone and has taken the money with him. Luffy decides to say good-bye to Merry.","The episode starts off with the scene of Usopp standing in the doorway of the Franky House, demanding the money back from the Franky Family. Members of the Franky House mock him and call him weak, leading him to attempt to attack Franky. Franky dodges, and continues to mock Usopp while Usopp is down on the floor and out of breath. After a final kick to the chin, Franky leaves Usopp with the rest of his family members and says he's going out shopping with the Straw Hats money. However, Usopp shoots an exploding star at Franky, that doesn't affect him at all. As Franky leaves the house, members of the Franky Family beat up Usopp.
The scene then switches to Nami, wielding a pistol and protecting the last briefcase of money on the Going Merry, while reassuring herself that ""they"" (Chopper, Sanji, and Zoro, who are presumably going to get Usopp and head to the Franky House), can do it and she would only be a burden if she went along with them.
The episode switches to the perspective of Chopper, Sanji, and Zoro, who seem to have went the wrong way, as Usopp is not where Nami told them he would be. Chopper then notices a trail of blood, leading them to realize that Usopp might have gone to the Franky House on his own. Suddenly, Luffy falls out of the sky and lands in the canal. After Luffy was saved, they are assured that Usopp probably went to the house by himself.
We then see the government officials who visited Iceburg leaving Iceburg's office. The main government official of the group then goes on to talk about how Iceburg might have ""it"", insinuating that he has something of importance. From the perspective of Iceburg, Kalifa knocks on the door, and they speak about the ""it"" that the government official, Corgi, was referring to, telling us that he has whatever ""it"" is. We then see a wanted poster of a young Nico Robin on the wall of Iceburg's office.
The perspective then switches to Chopper, Zoro, Luffy, and Sanji, who find an unconscious Usopp outside of the Franky House. Seeing Usopp that way fueled their anger, and they head into the Franky House. The group walks in on a bunch of money-high Franky Family members, who are partying. After seeing one of the members get punched, the rest of them become scared. However, they gain back their confidence which immediately disappears again after Luffy punches through steel armor. After the Franky Family members lose, the scene cuts to Franky himself, getting on a train, and then back to the Straw Hats who decide to go back to the ship instead of chasing Franky. Luffy also decides they will say goodbye to the Going Merry.","Usopp, Franky, Mozu and Kiwi, Kiev, Schollzo, Zambai, Kop, Tamagon, Nami, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

The Pirate Ship Trembles in Sadness!,12-Jun-05,"Once they are back on the ship, Luffy has to finally tell Usopp that the Going Merry can no longer be repaired and that he has chosen to get a new ship. Usopp believes that Luffy has abandoned the dignity of their ship and says he is leaving the crew. He then challenges Luffy to a duel for the Going Merry.","The episode begins with Usopp waking up after he was beaten unconsious by the Franky Family. It is also noted that Nico Robin has not yet returned to the ship.
He is informed by Luffy that the stolen money probably can not be retrieved and that the crew has decided to buy a new ship instead of repairing the Going Merry. Usopp is enraged by this, which prompts Luffy to clarify that it is impossible to repair the Merry with the damage she has sustained. Usopp refuses to accept this and thinks that Luffy has abandoned the Merry. The two get into a fight which eventually prompts Usopp to leave the crew. This was not only due to the current situation, but a culmination of Usopp's insecurity that he was too weak to be a part of the Straw Hat Pirates. This ends with Usopp challenging Luffy to a duel for the rights to the Merry.
Later that night, Nami tries to dissuade Luffy from fighting with Usopp. This is unsuccessful and Luffy still wishes to fight Usopp. Chopper tries to heal Usopp, but he also refuses. Later, Usopp and Luffy meet for the fight.","Tony Tony Chopper, Monkey D.

Episode 236,Luffy vs. Usopp! The Spirit of the Clashing Men,19-Jun-05,"Usopp challenges Luffy in order to decide who keeps the Going Merry. Though he is injured, Usopp fights harder than he has ever fought before. Luffy actually seems to pose no threat but all the while, he remembers what great friends they used to be, sailing together on the same ship. Even after taking a harsh beating, Luffy defeats Usopp. Luffy and the crew then leave Usopp and the ship behind.","As promised, Usopp returns to Scrap Island at 10pm for the duel with Luffy. Luffy tells him not to have any regrets regardless of the outcome. Usopp replies that, unlike previous enemies, he is well aware of what Luffy is capable of, and is ready to defeat him. He tells Luffy to come at him with everything he has. The rest of the Straw Hat Pirates watch from the deck of the Going Merry with varying degrees of concern.
Usopp starts with some of the boasts he made when they first met. When Luffy comes at him with Gomu Gomu no Pistol, Usopp uses his Hissatsu Ketchup Boshi to fake coughing up blood. This stops Luffy in his tracks out of concern. Usopp mocks him for showing pity on the enemy, and blinds him with a Flash Dial, then hits him with Hissatsu Tamago Boshi, pelting his former captain with rotten eggs. Luffy tells Usopp to get serious; Usopp says he is, reminding him that this is how he fights. Usopp shoots Hissatsu Tabasco Boshi right in Luffy's mouth, making him spit fire and fall back right onto a pile of caltrops, scratching up his body. When Luffy gets up, Usopp knocks him back down with Hissatsu Koshou Boshi, which explodes in a cloud of ground pepper. Luffy coughs in fits and repeatedly lands in the caltrops.
Luffy recovers enough to finally get out of the caltrops, remarking how much it hurts. Usopp says he will not give Luffy a chance to retaliate, and starts to amp up the danger with Shuriken Ryuuseigun, firing strings of throwing stars at Luffy, forcing him to focus on dodging. He gets in an area that appears to be smoky. Usopp says it is actually gas coming from a Breath Dial, but he could not smell it because of the rotten eggs. Usopp fires Kaen Boshi, setting off a tremendous explosion that throws Going Merry back from the shore. For a moment, Luffy lays on the ground and thinks about the past with Usopp. The water thrown up by the explosion makes it look like the ship itself is crying.
Usopp remarks he knows that explosion would not kill Luffy. Luffy tries to attack with Gomu Gomu no Gatling, but Usopp responds with Sakuretsu Saboteso Boshi, which explodes on Luffy's fist and pummels Luffy with small pins. Usopp fires several Sanren Kayaku Boshi at Luffy, forcing him to dodge the resulting explosions. Luffy finally knocks Usopp back with Gomu Gomu no Pistol. But when he tries Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, Usopp catches it with an Impact Dial and dishes it back out on Luffy, knocking Luffy back, but also injuring his arm with the recoil. That was the last of Usopp's tricks. Out of ideas, he stands there and takes it as Luffy fires Gomu Gomu no Bullet, punching him hard in the chest and knocking him out, winning the duel.
Putting his straw hat back on, Luffy tells Usopp that he can keep the Going Merry, and bids him goodbye. Chopper wants to treat him, but Sanji stops him, saying it is wrong to show pity on the loser of a duel. Chopper still leaves some supplies for him to help treat himself. As he returns to the ship, Luffy tears up, commenting on the heavy burden. Zoro responds that it is the burden of the captain, and the rest of the crew relies on him to bear it. As Luffy, Chopper, and Nami tear up over this turn of events, the crew then leaves the ship, and a crying Usopp, behind.","Usopp, Monkey D.

Franky appears then to exact his revenge - with style.","Usopp is alone on the Going Merry, reflecting on how Luffy defeated him and left him behind. Meanwhile, the crowd investigates an incident.
On top of a building, Sanji and Chopper were about to start searching the town for Robin, before Nami interrupts and tells Luffy that Iceburg was shot in his own home, with the only clue being an ornate mask at the scene. Kaku and Lulu were speculating on who was responsible, suspecting Corgi of the World Government, while the citizens suspect the Franky Family and the Big Helmet Pirates. Lucci and Kalifa visited Iceburg, who was comatose, in the hospital.
Nami and Luffy ride on a Yagara to investigate the assassination attempt. Nami finds an unconscious Usopp in the streets, reflecting on how Usopp left the crew. Meanwhile, Franky returns from his shopping spree back to Water 7, only to be shocked at how the Franky House was destroyed. The Franky Family members who regained consciousness confirm that the Straw Hat Pirates were responsible, and they were likely headed for Dock No. 1.
At the lighthouse, due to strong wind, Kokoro declares that the Aqua Laguna was reaching Water 7, so she headed for the mainland. A citizen explains to Sanji that the Aqua Laguna was an annual high tide that flooded much of the city, so the people of Water 7 evacuate to higher ground.
While Sanji and Chopper continue searching for Robin, Nami and Luffy find that Dock No. 1 was crowded due to the assassination.

The Galley-La Company run outside to stop Franky and Luffy and tell them that they suspect the Straw Hat Pirates committed the crime.","Franky continues to call out to Luffy urging for a fight. Luffy is confused on how the stranger knows his name but Nami quickly informs in that is Franky. Luffy then finally recognizes that man responsible for beating up Usopp and calls out to Franky wanting to fight.
Back at the hospital, Kalifa informs the others of the Galley-La Company that Iceburg is now awake but still badly injured and can go into his room to see him. Paulie informs Iceburg that he and the rest of the company will watch over the shipyard until he recovers. Iceburg then immediately tells the others that he remembers who attacked him and says that one of them was with the Straw Hat Pirates indicating Nico Robin. Outside, the people are excited to hear that Iceburg is awake.
Back at the shipyard, Franky taunts Luffy about attacking his gang and destroying his house. Nami only wants their money back but Franky says that he has already spent it. However, Luffy doesn't care about the money and wants revenge. The people suddenly start to move away as Franky suddenly starts taking in a large amount of air. Franky then suddenly lets out a large amount of fire that nearly hits Luffy, Nami, and the other Water 7 citizens. Nami assumes that Franky has Devil Fruit powers and Franky suddenly leaps into the water much to the confusion of Luffy and Nami. Franky then suddenly crashes into the boat sending Luffy and Nami into the air and Franky says that he hasn't ate a Devil Fruit. As Luffy falls toward Franky, Franky launches his Strong Right move right at Luffy sending him flying across the water, into the wall, and downward right on the top of his head. Franky moves onto shore as the other people run away and Nami wonders if Franky doesn't have Devil Fruit powers, then what is he. Franky then takes off his hand saying he's actually a human with robotic parts, also known as a cyborg.
Back at the Galley-La Company, Paulie is confused and shocked to hear that one of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Kalifa confirms this and says that she had Lucci contact the government for more information. Hattori then says that Robin is a notorious criminal and is no surprise that she will do something so sadistic. Kaku then says that the next thing to do is to find the Straw Hats and Lulu wonders if they did this because they wouldn't fix their ship. However, Kaku sums up that the Straw Hats are responsible and must be dealt with. At a different location, Sanji and Tony Tony Chopper are sailing on a boat still looking for Robin. Chopper is still worried about the large wave that will sink Water 7 underwater but Sanji remembers that Chopper left something behind on the Merry. Sanji then turns around much to the excitement of Chopper.
At the Galley-La Company, Tilestone charges into the room loudly excited to hear that Iceburg is awake (much to the disdain of the others due to Tilestone's loud yelling). Annoyed, Paulie knocks Tilestone out of the room telling him to keep it down as Iceburg needs the silence to recover. Tilestone then apologizes and then tells Paulie that Luffy and Franky are fighting and destroying the entire shipyard in the process. Paulie is clearly angered by this and Hattori says that at least they know where to find him. Paulie then leads the other members of the Galley-La out to confront Luffy and Kalifa informs Iceburg that now he has peace and quiet. At the shipyard, Luffy and Franky continue to brawl as they wreck the shipyard as they fight. Luffy launches his Gomu Gomu Pistol which sends Franky flying backwards and Franky retaliates with a giant blast (Weapons Left). Luffy dodges the attack and attempts to counter back with a kick but Franky blocks it. Suddenly, both Franky and Luffy are suddenly punched backwards and it was revealed to be by Galley-La. The people are excited to see them and Luffy is just as confused to why they attacked him. Franky warns Galley-La not to interfere with his fight with Luffy but Galley-La simply ignores him and Paulie questions Luffy.

Franky yells out in frustration about Galley-La attacking Luffy, but the other Galley-La members prepare for a fight. Lulu then fires shots at Luffy who absorbs it due to his Devil Fruit powers and Lulu then roughly kicks Luffy onto the ground. Franky then starts to fire at Galley-La and Kaku falls down from above. Franky attempts to blast him but Tilestone knocks him away with a giant log. Kaku then grabs Franky and slams him onto the ground. Meanwhile, Luffy is in a fist fight with Lucci who eventually knocks him backward with his hand. Luffy still doesn't understand why Galley-La is attacking him and Paulie says that one of the members of the Straw Hats attempted to murder Iceburg. Back in the hospital room, Iceburg is remembering that one of the attackers was indeed Nico Robin and wonders if the masked man is also with the Straw Hats.

Iceburg says he wants to see Robin one more time.","After getting up, Franky is surprised to hear that Iceburg has been shot while Nami is shocked to hear that Galley-La is blaming them for the attempted murder. Luffy yells out that they haven't shot anybody but Paulie doesn't believe him. Paulie then says that Iceburg explained that two people attacked him: a tall man with a mask and the other being Nico Robin. Luffy and Nami are extremely shocked to hear this while Paulie thinks that she and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates came to Water 7 just to murder Iceburg. Franky is surprised to hear that Iceburg survived five shots and Paulie informs him that Iceburg is a tough guy before turning his attention back to Luffy. Suddenly, Luffy is cut on the face by a weapon thrown by Kaku who says that Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hats are wanted: dead or alive. He then says that now that Luffy and the other Straw Hat Pirates have broken the law, the law has turned their back on them. Luffy gets up and explains that they choose to become pirates and doesn't believe that Robin will try and kill someone.
Luffy gets up and wants to talk to Iceburg himself still saying that Robin cannot have done such a thing. Peepley Lulu then says that they won't let Luffy anywhere near Iceburg implying that criminals don't have the right to make demands. The Water 7 citizens then cheer at the remark and some of them manage to hold down Nami. Luffy still doesn't want to believe that Robin will try and kill someone but Paulie ignores his pleas. Paulie warns Luffy that there is no place to run or hide and prepares for a fight. He ties Luffy by his wrist trapping him but Luffy then dodges the blades thrown by Kaku. Paulie taunts Luffy while Luffy says that he still doesn't want to fight. Lulu drops his pistols knowing that Luffy's ability makes him invulnerable to gun shots and takes out saws along with Rob Lucci and Tilestone takes out a cannon. Tilestone fires the cannon and it appears to have hit Luffy. However, Luffy manages to dodge it by grabbing onto a rope that is holding a large crate hanging above at the last second. Lucci jumps up a Luffy with the large saw and misses Luffy but cuts the rope that he was grabbing onto. Luffy lands on the ground and dodges the broken crate pieces that try to fall on him. Luffy nearly runs into Lulu who attempts to attack him with swords but Luffy dodges each attack and backs himself to the nearby wall. Kaku traps Luffy by pinning him down onto the will with his blades and Tilestone blasts him with the cannon.
As a large smoke engulfs the area, Franky can be seen cheering for Galley-La as they overpower Luffy. However, Franky doesn't really mean it as he believes that he is the one that should defeat Luffy. Franky gets up and yells out to Galley-La to get out of his way. However, Kaku simply informs him that once they are done with Luffy, Franky can fight them all he wants. Franky gets real upset thinking that Galley-La is simply ignoring him and begins to charge up a large amount of energy. He then lets it all out a hurricane-powered blast that knocks away Galley-La, the citizens, and destroys Dock One in the process (Coup de Vent). During the blast, Nami escapes by headbutting the man that was trapping her and manages to get out of the blast range. Paulie explains how strong the move is while the large crane falls down and a large amount of smoke emerges the remains of Dock One. Nami is shocked to see how strong Franky really is and notices that there is no more angry mob. Suddenly, Luffy appears, unharmed, telling Nami to run. Luffy says that they must talk to Iceburg and the people notice that they are trying to escape. Luffy grabs onto Nami and grabs onto a building to get away.
Just outside the gates of Water 7, Sanji and Chopper are watching over the Going Merry where Usopp is residing in. Sanji then says that they shouldn't get too close so that Usopp wouldn't recognize them. Sanji and Chopper suddenly start yelling at each other saying how Aqua Laguna is going to hit soon and must evacuate. Usopp starts to come out from the ship and Sanji and Chopper run away before he could notice them. Usopp is confused as he thought he heard someone but remembers how they are talking about the storm and notices the wind starting to pick up. Back at the remains of Dock One, Mozu and Kiwi remind Franky that Luffy and Nami are getting away. However, Franky says that his Coup de Vent exhausted him and his hair is a sign of this. Franky then promises to chase after Luffy again once he is recharged. In another area, Galley-La are getting themselves back up after Franky's last attack. Kaku is surprised at Franky's strength but Paulie remains them that they can't get away. Paulie says that the Aqua Laguna is going to hit soon and there are only two ways they could leave Water 7: by their ship or by the next Sea Train.

As a Sea Train is heading for Water 7, Chimney and Gonbe can be seen from the window. Kokoro taunts them saying not to fall into the ocean.
Luffy and Nami manage to make it to Galley-La Company but notices a bunch of shipwrights acting like guards. Nami concludes that Iceburg is inside and Luffy then bursts through the window.

As the shipwrights reach Kalifa, she informs them that Luffy hasn't been around and the shipwrights begin to scout the area. In Iceburg's room, Luffy thanks Iceburg for saving him from the shipwrights and Iceburg knows that Luffy isn't here to murder him. Luffy wants to hear Iceburg's side of the story about who attacked him and Iceburg concludes that Nico Robin was the culprit. Luffy thinks that there might be someone else that looked like Robin but Iceburg suddenly holds up a gun to him and he wants Luffy to bring Robin to him. Outside, the people are reading the newspaper articles about the Straw Hat Pirates attempting to murder Iceburg. Robin can then be seen reading the same newspaper article and looks down at the people with an emotionless stare.","Kaku, Tilestone, Peepley Lulu, Rob Lucci, Paulie, Monkey D.

Back out in the main area of Water 7, an announcement is being broadcast telling everyone to prepare for Aqua Laguna. More people can be seen boarding up their homes and tying down their boats with another man saying that the pirates will show up soon.

Back at the Inn, the shipwrights are questioning the manager with him saying that the Straw Hats were staying at his inn but suspect that they may come back due to them leaving their luggage behind. At the Going Merry, the shipwrights begin searching around. One of the shipwrights questions another about the ship being theirs and the other shipwright confirms it due to their flag. However, another shipwright inspects the ship and says that it's too badly damaged to sail anymore. Usopp can be seen hiding behind a large rock preparing to fire. The shipwrights conclude that the Straw Hat Pirates abandoned the ship and they leave. Usopp is left to wonder who those people were and wonders if anything is going wrong in the city.
Back in town, Luffy and Nami can be seen sneaking around in the alleyways. Nami then worries about the others but says that Sanji and Chopper are safe due to the people not knowing their faces. Sanji can be seen watching over the Sea Train departures with Chopper close by. Chopper wonders if Robin got on a Sea Train and Sanji hopes she hasn't due to the size of the city. Sanji then asks a nearby person if he has seen Robin. The man simply replies that he would've turned her in due to her being an assassin. Sanji and Chopper then start to worry for the others especially with Aqua Laguna coming soon. Suddenly, Chopper begins to pick up a scent and starts to follow it. Chopper begins to run faster with Sanji trying to keep up. Eventually, both Chopper and Sanji spot Robin on the other side of the water and wonders where she has been. Sanji hopes that Robin will come back and tries to find another way to get to her side but she tells him not to. Robin then says that she won't be coming back to the Straw Hat Pirates and Sanji thinks it's because of the newspaper and says that he doesn't believe it. However, Robin confirms that she did try to kill Iceburg and explains that she has a darkness inside her. She warns Sanji and Chopper that the darkness will be the end of them. She says that the situation will get worse and thanks them for all the kindness they have shown her and turns around to leave. Sanji and Chopper are in shock as they watch Robin walk away. Sanji jumps into the water to go after her while Chopper calls out to her name.","Monkey D.

Nami sums up that Robin plans on murdering Iceburg tonight and Zoro says that Robin told Chopper what she is planning so that the rest of the crew will be blamed for the murder as well. Nami yells at Zoro for already saying that Robin is an enemy but Zoro says he is just bringing up the possibilities and says if she is his friend, he has to be ready to forgive but if she is his enemy, he has to be ready to fight. Zoro then says that the best chance to settle this is at night and Luffy and the others agree to go. Nami then remembers hearing that Robin was seen walking with a masked man and wonders if he is the reason why Robin is doing what he is doing.

Kaku thinks it's an odd time for a one-on-one conversation and he and Paulie wants to know what it's about. Tilestone attempts to talk loudly but Paulie, Kaku, Lucci, and Lulu all knock him out before he can do so.

Just outside, Robin can be seen with the bear-masked CP9 agent and they receive a message from another agent. The agent says that there will be a signal just in a moment and that will be their time to strike. The bear-masked agent asks Robin if she's ready and she confirms so. Suddenly, a large explosion goes off shocking everyone in the area including the shipwrights and the Straw Hats. The bear-masked agent and Robin then make their move and jump into the courtyard. The shipwrights inside are running around trying to find any intruders. Tilestone asks if Iceburg is okay and Iceburg says he is but a little shocked. Tilestone overhears other shipwrights finding a masked man in the building and he and Lulu run off. Kaku attempts to stop them but decides to sit just outside the door along with Lucci. Back outside, some shipwrights are chasing another masked CP9 agent. The CP9 agent easily takes them down and heads up for the room. More shipwrights can be seen being taken down by Robin's ability and the bear-masked agent easily knocks some aside. Chopper continues to watch them down there and Zoro, Chopper, and Nami all notice that Luffy is gone. Zoro and Nami are furious that Luffy rushed off without a plan.
A mob of shipwrights corner Robin and the masked-bear agent and they threaten to kill them. The masked-bear agent pulls out and cape and, as the shipwrights are shooting, he and Robin suddenly disappear leaving the shipwrights confused. Back on the roof, the other masked CP9 agent continues to fight off the shipwrights. The masked agent suddenly starts walking/flying around in the air (Geppou) and takes out a mob of shipwrights with his rose attack (Thorny Rose).

Robin and the bear-masked agent walk to a wall and the bear-masked agent suddenly makes a door into Iceburg's room from the wall. Iceburg is shocked to see this and the bear-masked agent says it's because of the Door Door Fruit. He then shoots Iceburg on the shoulder causing him to fall onto the ground. Robin is surprised by this but the agent says it's not fatal but a warning shot. Iceburg then notices that Luffy has nothing to do with the assassination plot and Robin confirms this. The bear-masked agent then says that Iceburg is alive for two reason: to tell his side of the story of the assassination plot and they were trying to find an important document - blueprints of a ship. The bear-masked agent then says knowing that Iceburg's life is in danger, that he will pass it down to his most trusted. Iceburg then realizes it's a trap and that Paulie is in trouble. The bear-masked agent then tells Robin that he'll go and deal with the people just outside the door and that if the blueprints are retrieve, she'll have to kill Iceburg. He then says that once Iceburg is gone, Paulie will be gone as well and the blame will still be placed on the Straw Hats. Back outside, Zoro, Chopper, and Nami are running toward the building talking about how Luffy recklessly rushed in.

Elsewhere, Luffy is tied up with Paulie and Paulie tells some members of the mysterious CP9 that the blueprints he has are fake.","At the Galley-La Company, more shipwrights are being massacred by the bear-masked CP9 agent.

Tilestone is visibly shocked and angry at the sight he has just seen and the bear-masked agent says he's getting tired of dealing with all of the shipwrights. Tilestone, in a rage, charges at the masked CP9 agent with his mallet but the agent hardens his body to completely block the attack (Tekkai).

The other shipwrights attempt to get away but the masked-bear agent quickly runs after them and takes them out as well.
Just outside, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper are running from a mob of shipwrights who are shooting at them. Nami wonders if Luffy isn't there, then where is he.

Zoro charges at the group of shipwrights and starts to knock them away with the ends of his swords (with Nami and Chopper informing him that he can still kill the shipwrights that way.
In Iceburg's room, Robin is still watching over an injured Iceburg who is actually glad to meet her face to face. Iceburg suddenly pulls out a gun and Robin responds by pulling out multiple guns using her power. Robin notices that he wanted to kill her and Iceburg demands why she is looking for the Poneglyphs. Iceburg informs her that the World Government has made it illegal to continue research on them and knows that Robin can decipher them. He concludes that, despite being 8 years old at the time, this is why the bounty on her head is so high. Robin confirms his theory and Iceburg admits he didn't believe CP9 exists and notices that Robin left the Straw Hats to help out. Iceburg then says that weapon would never bring peace to the world, only destruction. He then tells Robin to abandon the idea and let it die. Robin simply tells him not to tell her what to do with her research and Iceburg says that they both have a lot in common. Iceburg then says that he has the blueprints for the ancient weapon known as Pluton much to Robin's surprise. Iceburg continues saying how Pluton was a battleship build on the island many years ago and the shipwrights that had the blueprints passed it down fearing that another battleship of equal power would fall into the wrong hands. Iceburg notices that the World Government wants to revive Pluton as there in no force to oppose it. Iceburg as that a man named Tom trusted the blueprints to him and how there was a young girl that could decipher the blueprints. Iceburg attempts to shoot Robin but she quickly pins him down and holds him at gunpoint.

Paulie taunts them saying their plan is a failure but both CP9 agents move in for the kill. Suddenly, Luffy comes crashing at the wall but gets stuck in the process. He notices Paulie on the ground injured but then turns his attention to the masked agents demanding them to give back Robin. The skull masked agent kicks away at the wall (Tempest Kick) nearly hitting Luffy but dodges at the last second. However, the bull masked agent kicks him down and pins him to the ground.

The Straw Hat Pirates and Paulie break into the room where they find Iceburg and CP9.","Franky is shown watching Usopp fix the Going Merry from afar with Mozu and Kiwi. Usopp is then shown remarking about the weather becoming rough as he patches the ship. Franky then remembers Usopp's determination in getting the 200,000 belly to fix his ship, as he does so Mozu mentions that the ship must be what he needed the money for and Kiwi notes Usopp's ignorance in the weather. Which causes Franky to say that Usopp's plight in fixing the ship is a lost cause. As Franky approaches the ship he repeats his comment about it being useless loud enough for Usopp to hear in order to reveal his presence. After realizing who Franky is Usopp asks why he is here and Franky says that he will just have to take him and the ship hostage due to the storm saying that he has some business with Straw Hat Luffy and has come to kidnap Usopp.
In the Galley-La building courtyard, Zoro is fighting the shipwrights attempting to protect Iceburg, thinking that it is okay because he used the back of his swords to defeat them all. Nami then yells at him for taking them all out when it wasn't necessary while Chopper fauns over Zoro's strength. Nami and Chopper then lead the way through the building while yelling at Zoro for getting lost multiple times claiming it's a miracle. Luffy is shown escaping the metal constraints that the masked men put him and Paulie in while Paulie is amazed at Luffy's devil fruit powers. Once he gets out Luffy starts to work on Paulie's constraints as well.
Lucci is then shown unmasked explaining to Iceburg that the World Government has intelligence agencies named Cipher Pol-1 though Cipher Pol-8 referred to as CP1 or CP8 by most people and that they can dig up any information the World Government needs. Once Iceburg says he is aware of these organizations Lucci goes on to explain that they are actually part of a unit that is supposedly non-existent and is called CP9 saying they are special because they have authorization to kill people who impede the governments wishes in the name of justice. Lucci continues saying that the world government has changed their tactics and decided that rather than living in fear of the weapon that they have decided to take possession of it and use it to end the great pirate era which Iceburg responds with mistrust towards the government and that it will only cause more damage if the weapon is restored saying that he knows human nature. After Lucci kicks Iceburg in the face for still acting like his boss Kaku goes to check his pulse as Lucci begins to lay out their hypothesis saying that Iceburg's pulse will tell them if it's true. 
In a street, Kokoro, Chimney and Gonbe are seen walking as Chimney asks if they are going back yet. Which Kokoro says that since the wind is good for sobering up they will take the long way as she drinks more alcohol which Chimney finds odd and asks if you can get sober while drinking. Kokoro just laughs and says that she can because she has been drinking for several decades. As Chimney and Gonbe run ahead into the fierce wind repeating how weird that is, Kokoro corrects herself and says she has only been drinking for 8 years.
Back in the room with CP9, Robin and Iceburg, Lucci starts telling Iceburg his hypothesis and the thinking behind it. Which starts with him explaining that they have doubts about the fake blueprints that he gave them saying that Iceburg knew that they were from the government, so he gave them a fake but if indeed the person had just come to kill him that the real blueprints would then be lost to the world. So in order to keep the protection of the weapon he had to pass them on to someone else but since he hadn't done it that night he had already entrusted them to someone else or that he doesn't have them with him. Then explaining that this is all a theory and has no proof, he continues his theory by saying that the person entrusted must have reasonable skills as a shipwright, he then pulls out the fake blueprints and notes that the architects had signed their names, them being Tom, Iceburg and Cutty Flam, otherwise known as Tom's Workers. Lucci continues saying that to anybody else this would have passed inspection and they would have believed that they were the real blueprints but because CP9 had been so close to Iceburg they knew about Tom's workers and along with their information from the World Government knew that Tom had had two disciples and that one was confirmed dead. However Lucci recalled the name Cutty Flam from someone who met with Iceburg just after they had started their undercover work. It then shows a flashback of Kalifa telling Iceburg of the man named Cutty Flam but Iceburg tells them to turn him away but that this proves that Cutty Flam is still alive and has actually changed his name to Franky. At which point Iceburg's pulse quickens rapidly, It then shows another flashback of Iceburg meeting Franky with Franky exclaiming that this is a weird way of meeting. Iceburg then gives him the plans for Pluton and tells Franky to no longer use the name Cutty Flam and that Franky should leave with the plans in case that he or Iceburg is targeted. Back in the present Kaku verifies the truth of Lucci's statements with Iceburg's quickened pulse and exclaims that he would have never made that connection. Lucci then says that they were never able to prove Franky's identity but because of his odd behavior and profession they didn't pay attention to him. After commending Iceburg for his smart thinking and explaining how they had the opportunity to meet and exchange the blueprints he then explains that since he doesn't have the blueprints and none of them were entrusted with them then it must have been entrusted with his fellow disciple and that while it may have been speculation Iceburg's pulse confirmed their theory as fact.
In the hallway, Nami, Chopper and Zoro are shown running past injured people, Chopper especially taking notice, Nami finds the correct room and slows down, along with Chopper, to have Zoro cut it down.

Paulie falls to his knees and Lucci explains how he and the other CP9 agents master an art known as Rokushiki that turns the human body into a living weapon. Paulie briefly remembers how he hanged around with Lucci, Blueno, Kalifa, and Kaku in the past and still doesn't understand why they would do this. Lucci attempts to attack Paulie but Luffy intervenes with a kick but Lucci simply blocks it. Luffy then uses Gomu Gomu no Gatling on Lucci but he blocks it using Tekkai suffering no damage.

Lucci then informs everyone that the building will be engulfed by fire as fire is the best way to wipe away evidence much to the other's shock. However, Lucci plans on not having the Straw Hats, Paulie, or Iceburg leave alive and the CP9 agents start to close in. Zoro says that it's them against the CP9 agents and that Robin has sided with them but Luffy doesn't want to accept that.

Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Pistol but Blueno dodges it using Soru and gets behind Luffy. Luffy attempts to attack him again but Blueno gets away using Geppo. Suddenly, Kalifa and Kaku appear behind Luffy and they both use Rankyaku on him sending him backwards. Zoro tells Nami and Chopper to duck out of the way which they do and Luffy is sent flying into the hallway. Zoro charges in but Kaku blocks the Pirate Hunter's swords with swords on his own. Zoro asks Kaku that he lied about the Going Merry's condition but Kaku said that he was correct at his assessment. The two swordsmen go at it and Luffy charges after Robin on Zoro's orders. However, Kaku uses Shigan several times on Zoro knocking the swordsman down while Luffy is caught by Lucci. Lucci then tells Robin to go and Robin makes her escape by jumping out the window. Lucci tosses Luffy down and the others remark how strong the CP9 agents are. Lucci says that they use their skills to hone for absolute justice and says that it's why they are one of the World Government's most elite fighters. Lucci then starts to transform into a large being completely shocking everybody.","Paulie, Kalifa, Kaku, Blueno, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Iceburg, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

Episode 246,Destruction of the Straw Hat Pirates? The Terror of the Model Leopard!,23-Oct-05,"Lucci's transformation is a result of a Devil Fruit, a Zoan type: the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard. He quickly disposes of the crew, and CP9 tie up Paulie and Iceburg, leaving them alone as the building slowly burns down around them. In Franky's underground hideout, Usopp tells him his story and Franky is finally touched. In return, Franky tells him a little about Tom's contributions to Water 7.","Lucci reveals himself to be a user of the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard, a Zoan-type Devil fruit that turns him into a leopard. Meanwhile, the first floor of Iceburg Mansion is set on fire, so the members of Galley-La run upstairs to check on Iceburg. Lucci keeps them at bay using the Rankyaku move, essentially cutting the entire mansion in half.
Lucci defeats both Luffy and Zoro, sending them both flying into the sea. Nami is also knocked out and thrown out the window. Paulie and Iceburg are left tied up near the fire. The members of CP9 then leave to get the blueprints from Franky.
Lucci confronts members of the Franky Family, who refuses to give answers as to where Franky was staying. Meanwhile, in Franky's warehouse, Franky is talking to Usopp, who is attempting to repair the ship. Franky explains that he took the ship to protect it from the Aqua Laguna, and that Water 7 was sinking.
Back on the streets, Lucci finishes off the Franky Family members.

Episode 247,The Man who is Loved by his Ship! Usopp's Tears!,30-Oct-05,"Franky tries to get Usopp to listen to reason about the condition of the Going Merry. Though Usopp does understand the truth, he relates some odd experiences occurring with the ship recently that gave him pause in admitting it. Meanwhile, the foremen of Galley-La Company appear to be on the move. Is the Franky Family their next target?","Back at Dock Six of Water 7, Usopp continues to patch up Going Merry. Franky asks Usopp point-blank what his plans are once Merry is fixed. He'd like to eventually sail Merry back to East Blue. Franky quickly tells him that's not happening. He had examined Merry while having it lifted into Dock Six, and corroborated Kaku's diagnosis of a broken keel. Franky suggests dismantling Merry was pretty much the only sane course. Usopp told him not to, raising his slingshot against him. Franky said that if Usopp's plan were to go down with Merry, he'd gladly allow Usopp to go through with it. But a ship had one purpose: to carry people from one shore to another. By his judgment, Merry was not going to make it to the next shore. Therefore, it was no longer a ship. He grabbed a piece of Merry's hull and ripped it off. Usopp responded by firing Kaen Boshi at Franky, knocking him back.
Franky, determined to force him to listen to reason, grabs Usopp and throws him down into the work bay, telling him to see the damage for himself. Laying on the bottom of the water, Usopp sees the previous patches applied to the keel of the Going Merry, as well as the additional damage that both Franky and Kaku had warned him out. Still, he climbs out of the water, drags the piece of hull that Franky broke off Merry back into place, and patches it back together. Franky again tells Usopp there is no way Merry will survive another voyage, least of all with an amateur shipwright like him. Usopp tells Franky to shut up...then falls to his knee crying and confesses that he knew all along Merry was no longer seaworthy.
He relates an experience from Skypiea, something he thought originally was a dream. He heard what sounded like a wooden mallet hammering on Merry. Though no one should've been there, he could've sworn he saw someone hammering at the ship. The next morning, the Straw Hats found that the ship was inexplicably, though haphazardly, repaired. Not only that, but it had also been restored to its original plan, missing all its previous modifications, including those made for the flight to Skypiea. He recalls hearing a mysterious voice saying the ship would carry them for a little while longer, as if it were the ship itself speaking to him. When he heard the Galley-La assessment, he remembered those words, as if the ship itself were trying to reassure him.
Usopp then told Franky that he probably thinks he's crazy. But not only does Franky believe Usopp, he knows exactly what phenomenon Usopp was talking about. Usopp had found Merry's Klabautermann: a particular spirit manifested on ships that are cared for greatly by their crews. According to legend, these spirits assist sailors in their time of need. Although Franky had heard the legend many times before, this was the first time he had ever heard someone mention seeing one.
Franky asks Usopp why he fought Luffy over Merry and left the Straw Hat Pirates when he knew the ship was doomed. Usopp only manages to say it's not that simple before the doorbell rang. Mozu and Kiwi go to answer the door while Franky and Usopp continue to argue over how best to handle the situation; Franky insists he will take care of Merry in a more respectful manner, but Usopp is still not ready to let go even though it is hopeless. This brings out Usopp's feelings that Merry would be disposed of like useless garbage.
Suddenly, Mozu and Kiwi are knocked unconscious by the person at the door: Kalifa. She is joined by Kaku, Blueno, and Rob Lucci. The episode ends with Franky charging them, identifying them as Galley-La.","Usopp, Kiwi, Franky, Mozu, Klabautermann (flashback), Nami (flashback), Monkey D.

Episode 248,Franky's Past! The Day the Sea Train First Ran!,6-Nov-05,"The foremen discovered Franky's hidden room, and he feared they would trample his memories. A long flashback ensued, covering Franky's past in Tom's Workers and how he and Iceburg helped create the Sea Train.","Franky, angry, charges in and attempts to attack Kalifa for injuring Mozu and Kiwi but Blueno blocks his attack using Tekkai. However, Franky manages to pick up Blueno and overpowering him while yelling at the CP9 agent. Blueno attempts to use Shigan on Franky but Rob Lucci stops him saying they need Franky alive after kicking Franky away. Usopp is surprised at Franky thinking what he did to get Lucci and the others mad (still thinking they're with Galley-La). Franky wants to know how CP9 found out his hidden base but Lucci says it's irrelevant and says that they are there now and are assigned an operation. He then reveals to Franky that they are spies working for the World Government and surprises Franky by revealing his real name as ""Cutty Flam"". Franky is impressed on their detective work but is worried and wants to know where Iceburg is. Lucci says that he is dead much to Franky's shock. Lucci continues saying that Tom entrusted the blueprints to Pluton to Iceburg who then entrusted to Franky and demands Franky to hand over the blueprints. Franky, enraged, fires his right hand at Lucci who effortlessly dodges it and ruthlessly knocks Franky backwards sending him crashing through the wall. Usopp is shocked at what just happened and the crash reveals a secret room. Lucci is surprised to see this and Kalifa informs them they are drafting tables. Lucci confirms that it may be where the Pluton blueprints are and orders the other CP9 agents to find them. Blueno spots nameplates that says ""Cutty Flam"", ""Iceburg"", and ""Tom"" and Lucci walks over to a picture. Franky, who is up on his feet again, tells Lucci not to touch it saying that picture is his memories and is where he grew up with Tom's Workers.
A long flashback starts with a younger Franky riding on one of his Battle Frankies to Water 7. Franky turns around spots a large Sea King chasing after him and fires cannonballs at it. However, it has no effect only angering the beast more. The Sea King dives into the water causing Franky to crash onto land over Iceburg. Iceburg yells at Franky but soon runs away after seeing the large Sea King who attempts to attack him. Iceburg yells at Franky again saying they should be working on ships and not some ""toys"" but Franky yells back saying they're not toys but his battleships the Battle Frankies. They continue arguing until Tom lifts up the ship and builds it together using sheer strength. Tom is excited at his work with Yokozuna agreeing and Iceburg and Franky are staring in shock. Tom and Yokozuna walk off with Iceburg and Franky giving chase. At Tom's Workers, the group are eating and Tom asks about Franky's latest Battle Franky model. Iceburg blasts Franky on how his latest ship almost got both of them killed but Franky yells back at him. Tom could only laugh at this while Kokoro walks in and tries to calm them down. Kokoro then says that another ship carrying lumber was attacked by pirates and that since the King of the Pirates was executed, the entire city was being taken over. She continues saying that due to that, people are losing hope and that Aqua Laguna is preventing them from getting lumber properly. She fears that Water 7 will eventually sink into the ocean due to the frequent Aqua Laguna hits. Franky remembers that Tom build a large pirate ship before and asks if he could build one. However, Tom laughs angering Franky and Tom says that there is no such thing as a blueprint for a pirate ship but the flag makes it. Later that night, Franky wonders what Tom is working on and Tom says that it's hope for their island and then tells Franky to go to bed.
At daytime, a large Judicial Ship pulls into Water 7 and the people want to know what they are here for. It turns out that they are here for Tom and the Marines start to bring him aboard the ship. Franky and Iceburg attempt to get to Tom but a couple of Marines stop them but Tom reassures them that he will be fine. Aboard the ship, the trial is being watched over by Jorge and one of the men says that Tom was responsible of building the Oro Jackson: Gold Roger's ship. He says that Tom has been sentenced to be executed in Enies Lobby due to his involvement with Gold Roger and Franky is horrified to hear this. Jorge says that building a ship is not a crime but says that he must make an exception for the King of the Pirates. Jorge then says that Tom is sentenced to death and orders the Marines to take him away. However, the Marines are unable to move Tom due to his size and strength and Tom starts to speak up about his new project. He says that it will be a train that will run on the surface of the water and says that he'll help lift up the spirits of the people by building a Sea Train. The people and even Jorge sound interested and Jorge tells the Marines to let Tom stay and asks Tom to tell him more. Tom says that the Sea Train is like a ship but pumps out steam and runs on the tracks. He says that it will transport people, goods, and even ships to other islands and won't be affected by the conditions of the seas. Two people complain saying that Aqua Laguna will destroy the tracks and the Sea Kings will cause trouble as well. However, Tom says that the tracks will be submerged under the water a bit so that it won't be affected by the waves and even plans on adding a special siren underwater so that the fish will be alerted when the Sea Train is coming. He says that it will even scare off the Sea Kings so that they won't bother the Sea Train. He plans on connecting the tracks to multiple places much to the excitement of the people and Tom says that he'll finish up the blueprints very soon but says that it'll take a master shipwright to build it. Jorge says that will the Sea Train will also run to Enies Lobby which Tom confirms this and says that the Sea Train will fill Water 7 back with hope. Jorge says how long it will take and Tom says that it will take ten years to build it. Jorge then tells Tom to build it and tells Tom that the next ten years will be considered as probation. The people are excited to hear the idea about the Sea Train but Franky still looks worried.
Back at Tom's Workers, Tom is glad to still be alive but Kokoro is a little worried that Tom was laughing but is glad to hear about the Sea Train. Iceburg comments saying that the Sea Train is a great idea but Franky suddenly gets up and teaches Yokozuna how to do the front crawl. Iceburg yells at Franky for leaving but Franky is still angry over how the World Government wants to execute Tom for all the work he has done. Franky leaves showing Yokozuna how to swim and Iceburg is still upset at him and even tells Tom that he should kick him out for how he is behaving. Tom says that two years ago, he found Franky on Scrap Heap Island firing cannonballs and Franky says that his parents ditched him. Tom says that his parents were most likely pirates that couldn't handle his behavior. Tom says that he has a good heart and says that he and Iceburg will become master shipwrights someday. Some scenes are shown with Tom showing the finished blueprints to Iceburg and Yokozuna cheers on. The three being to work on the raft while Franky watches from a distance. He constructs another Battle Franky but the others are more focused on building the Sea Train. Eventually, Franky starts to help out much to Tom's pleasure. Franky, Tom, Iceburg, and Yokozuna being constructing while facing several hindrances along the way (including being chased by Sea Kings and the railing breaking apart). Years later, the people are still sulking until one person says that the Sea Train has been completed. The people begin boarding the Sea Train with Kokoro being the conductor. The Sea Train successfully sets off much to the pleasure of the people, Tom, Yokozuna, Iceburg, and Franky. The Sea Train, Puffing Tom, officially makes its departure filling Water 7 with hope.","Franky, Kalifa, Blueno, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Usopp, Kaku, Iceburg (flashback), Tom (flashback), Yokozuna (flashback), Kokoro (flashback), Jorge (flashback), Paulie (flashback), Pandaman (flashback), Mozu (flashback), Kiwi (flashback)",
Episode 249,Spandam's Conspiracy! The Day the Sea Train Shook,13-Nov-05,"Spandam, a CP5 representative, is determined to get Tom proven guilty in his trial so he could get the blueprints. As Franky walks into the town, people from the government begin to attack with the battleships he had personally constructed. Tom and Iceburg run to their shipyard where they are attacked by two ships which also destroy the others. Iceburg tells Franky that he has to take responsibility or he will never forgive him.","Following his defeat at the hands of Rob Lucci, Zoro is sent across Water 7 and splashes onto the water until he crashes on top of a building (due to the rising water from Aqua Laguna's slowly coming in). Zoro gets up and issues some payback after being angered by Lucci then runs off. Elsewhere, Luffy can be heard screaming and yells out ""Not again!"" presumably stuck in another wall. Back at Franky's base, Lucci is reviewing how ships used to be built at the remains of Tom's Workers. Usopp is surprised by this while Lucci picks up the picture saying how Franky holds countless memories from the past. Franky yells at Lucci to get out but Lucci says that not until he gets the blueprints for Pluton. Franky says there are no blueprints but Lucci, annoyed, knocks over a drafting table. Franky yells out but Lucci orders Kalifa to tie up Franky using her thorny rose and she does so. Franky kneels from the pain and Lucci tells Franky to calm down as he knows everything from Franky's past especially about a crime that happened eight years ago. Franky yells out to Lucci and even calls him a ""freak"" which the agitated CP9 agent kicks Franky back. Franky remembers an experience from the past and tells Lucci that Lucci doesn't know anything about Tom or Water 7.
A long flashback dates back to eight years ago with the people of Water 7 enjoying the Sea Train Puffing Tom that Tom has his crew built. Two people explain that the Judicial Ship will be arriving soon and are positive that they'll let Tom go. Other people are a little worried that other islands want more for their items but aren't going to give up. Elsewhere, Iceburg can be seen constructing and says that the people are happy about being able to cross the ocean but they complain saying it's not good what they have hoped. However, Tom laughs at this saying they're spirits are up and see how time will tell. Suddenly, a group of men walk up and one of them starts talking to him. However, the man gets blasted by a cannonball but introduces himself as agent Spandam of CP5. It turns out that the cannonball came from Franky who is celebrating his recent kill of a Sea King using his newest Battle Franky 35. Iceburg is annoyed at Franky's childish behavior and starts pounding at Franky's battleship. Franky tries to stop him but Iceburg knocks him down and abruptly tells Franky that the battleships are dangerous and that someone else could get a hold of one and use it to harm others. Tom (with Spandam still following) shows up and Iceburg wants Tom to back him up on Franky not building anymore ships. Spandam suddenly speaks up wanting to talk with Tom and Tom assumes that he wants to talk about the trial. However, Spandam doesn't know about any trial but only wants to talk about something.
Back at Tom's Workers, Kokoro notices Iceburg and Franky arrive but Tom isn't with them. Iceburg informs her that he is with an World Government agent named Spandam but this only confuses Kokoro saying how someone from the World Government isn't with the Judicial Ship. Elsewhere, Tom tells Spandam that he has no blueprints. Spandam doesn't believe this and says he has been researching the history of Water 7 for a long time and knows that only Tom could have the blueprints in his possession. Tom laughs and says that Spandam has the authority to investigate him. Spandam says he does and knows of Tom's dealings with Gold Roger and threatens to tell the World Government about that if he doesn't give the blueprints. Tom says that the World Government already knows about him helping the Pirate King and Spandam is surprised by this wanting to know why Tom isn't either locked up or executed yet. Tom simply tells him to investigate more and kicks Spandam out. At a bar, the bartender tells Spandam that the judge will be dropping the charges due to Tom building the Sea Train. Spandam is angry by this and a brief flashback occurs with Spandam getting orders from the Five Elders themselves to get the blueprints Pluton. Spandam leaves the bar still angry about Tom being let off but Spandam punches a nearby ladder and paint falls on him. Spandam nearly slips but lands on his feet impressing his CP5 followers. Spandam promises that the charge will stay and that Tom will die but Spandam slips on the paint and falls into the water. Meanwhile, Tom grabs the blueprints from a hidden safe.
Back at Tom's Workers, Tom tells Iceburg and Franky to come to him as he has something very important to show them. A little later, Iceburg and Franky are both shocked and Tom says that it will be a nightmare if Pluton is built and is more worried now that the World Government knows about it. Tom says that he cannot keep the blueprints anymore and Iceburg agrees to take them. Franky actually wants to build it but Iceburg punches him saying that it should never be built. Tom says that the world will be done for and he suddenly puts down a wanted poster of Nico Robin (most likely hinting that she is the only known archaeologist that is alive that can decipher Pluton's blueprints).
It's daytime and Franky is seen leaving Tom's Workers. However, Kokoro stops him and gives him a pair of pants saying he caused an uproar in town last time he went there without his pants on. Franky, annoyed, then leaves and Kokoro wakes up Iceburg and Tom saying they don't want to miss Tom's trial. The people soon start to gather around and the Marines are seen talking with Jorge about Tom's sentence. Jorge says that he as seen the Sea Train and is happy to report that he'll be lifting Tom's sentence. Franky notices everyone around and is glad to hear that Tom will most likely will be let go. Suddenly, the Judicial Ship is being under attacked and the people start to run away. Some people spot a fleet arriving and, to his horror, Franky spots his battleships, the Battle Frankies, attacking the Judicial Ship. Iceburg quickly tells Tom that Franky's battleships are attacking the harbor but Tom knows that it's the World Government's doing. The people continue to run away and Franky runs off to see who is doing this (as Jorge wants to know who is behind this as well). It turns out to be by CP5 who are doing this under Spandam's orders and Spandam plans to place the blame on Tom. The CP5 agents withdraw and head back to Scrap Heap Island and Iceburg and Tom start to head for them. The CP5 agents spot Tom and Iceburg coming and they leave. Suddenly, two more ships blast at Iceburg and Tom.
Franky arrives and sees that Tom and Iceburg are badly injured. Franky wants to know what happened but Iceburg attacks Franky. Iceburg tells Franky that Spandam used the Battle Frankies to attack the people at the harbor much to Franky's shock. Iceburg then says that they have the ability to create dangerous weapons even if they're not intended to hurt or kill. Iceburg says that the World Government did that to place the blame onto Tom so that they can force him to hand over the blueprints. Iceburg continues to yell at Franky and says that if Tom gets taken away and hangs for this, Iceburg will never forgive Franky for the rest of his life. Franky screams and cries in horror after hearing all that has happened.","Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

Episode 250,The End of the Legendary Man! The Day the Sea Train Cried,27-Nov-05,"Tom's Workers were arrested for the attack on the judicial ship. Franky said that if a ship of his were to be used as a weapon, then it is no longer one of his ships. That enraged Tom and he punched Franky for the first time, telling him he had to take pride in the ships he created. He then told the judge that he would accept the punishment for his previous crime and asked to be pardoned for the recent attack so Franky and Iceburg would not go to Enies Lobby. But Franky got angry and hit Spandam with a gun, disfiguring his face, and ended up wanted anyway. Franky then tried to stop the train to Enies Lobby with his bare hands but ended up getting run over.","In the main square of Water 7, Zoro is still seen running across the rooftops but finds himself to be lost. Somewhere else, Luffy can be seen trying to free himself after getting stuck between some walls yet again. Zoro spots the burning building and runs toward it but ends up getting blown down by the wind. Meanwhile, Kokoro can be seen watching the fire from afar.
Back to eight years ago, Iceburg is still yelling at Franky saying he will never forgive him. Suddenly, Tom speaks up telling Iceburg not to blame Franky as he didn't do this. Franky runs over to Tom and notices a harpoon stuck in him saying that it's one of his special harpoons that is difficult to pull out once it gets stuck in. Franky apologizes to Tom but Tom says not to as it's not a problem to him. Soon, the people of Water 7 spot Tom, Iceburg, and Franky but are shocked to see that they're the ones injured as they think that Tom is the reason for the attack. Spandam with his CP5 agents appear behind them and Spandam says it's the time where all of them come quietly.
In town, Tom, Iceburg, and Franky are all handcuffed while Spandam explains that they are the ones that attacked the Judicial Ship and he and his CP5 agents managed to stop it in time. Some people wondered why Tom would do that as the judge would've acquitted his last offensive for building the Oro Jackson for Gold Roger thanks to him building the Sea Train Puffing Tom. Spandam walks up to Jorge where the two shake hands with the latter thanking Spandam for stopping the attack. Spandam says he'll take over the investigation and thinks to himself saying he's close to getting the blueprints for Pluton. Kokoro and Yokozuna are worried for Tom and the others.
Jorge then speaks up thanking Tom for building the Sea Train stating that Water 7 will continue to build but asks why Tom would attack the Judicial Ship. Franky speaks up saying it wasn't Tom but Spandam. However, the people all start laughing thinking that someone from the World Government wouldn't do something like that. Spandam then speaks up saying that the raid ships were created by Franky himself. Franky says that ships that do such a horrible thing aren't his ships anymore. Angry at his comments, Tom breaks free of his handcuffs and punches Franky much to the shock of everyone. Tom tells Franky that when a ship is built, no matter what type, it's neither good nor evil. He continues saying even if the ships hurt someone or could even destroy the world, the one who created them should never deny making them and never place the blame on the ships. Everyone, including Jorge and Spandam, stare in shock at Tom's comments and Tom tells Iceburg and Franky that whatever happens, not to interfere. Tom then violently punches Spandam causing horror to everyone. Tom continues to attack Spandam but Spandam orders the Marines and CP5 to shoot at Tom. Tom kneels down from the pain with Franky worried for him.
Spandam is pleased that Tom has been shot while Franky wonders why Tom did that. Spandam then orders his CP5 agents to arrest Tom, Iceburg, and Franky saying they'll be going to Enies Lobby. The people are shocked saying they didn't know that Tom would be so dangerous and the other people continue to talk down Tom much to the anger of Franky. Tom calms Franky down and suddenly speaks up saying he would like to confess. Tom then says that the raid on the judicial ship was led by him but requests to be pardoned from that crime. Jorge says that even if that was possible, Tom will be charged again for building the ship for Gold Roger and will receive the maximum penalty (death). Tom agrees to this saying he was proud of building a ship for the King of the Pirates Gold Roger much to the shock and anger of the people. Franky wants to know why and Tom tells Franky it's for the best not knowing the World Government would go to extreme lengths just to get the blueprints. Tom says that Water 7 is alive now saying he was glad to help out the city. Tom says his dream has finally begun to run and passes out from the tranquilizer's effects. In his mind, Tom tells Iceburg and Franky to take care of the blueprints and thanks everyone else (Kokoro and Yokozuna) for everything.
Spandam is excited to see that the tranquilizers have taken effect and orders his group to capture Tom, Iceburg, and Franky. However, Jorge says that Tom alone will be taken to Enies Lobby much to the annoyance of Spandam. Spandam then orders for Iceburg and Franky to be let go while the Marines are preparing to take Tom away. Kokoro tearfully says that Tom can't be let go as he sacrificed himself to save Iceburg and Franky. She continues on saying that anyone that has been taken to Enies Lobby has never come back and Franky's rage suddenly explodes. Franky grabs a pistol from a Marine and smashes Spandam's face with it. The people are horrified by this and Iceburg, Kokoro, and Yokozuna are shocked by what Franky just did. Franky is then shot by a Marine and Iceburg tells Franky to run away. Franky manages to get away and, on board the Sea Train now, Spandam is angry that Franky got away. Soon, Spandam is notified that Franky is on the tracks and orders the Sea Train to keep going. Franky tells Yokozuna to stay away while he fires at Puffing Tom telling it to not take its creator away. With the blasts having no effect, attempts to stop the Sea Train himself and remembers how Tom let him stay with him. Franky says he wants to continue building ships but can't love ships that hurt people. However, he would want to be a great shipwright like Tom and Franky is soon run over by Puffing Tom. In his mind now, Franky says he will build his own dream ship that will proudly sail upon the waters.
Back to the present, Rob Lucci says he heard that Tom was a great shipwright but was an uncontrollable Fish-Man with superhuman strength and has asked the citizens if they knew Tom but has gotten blank replies. Franky doesn't want to talk to Lucci anymore (with Usopp trying to calm him down) and Lucci says that many people and Marines were injured just because of Franky. However, due to Franky being confirmed dead after the Sea Train accident, the charges were dropped but now Franky is alive, he will be taken to Enies Lobby. Blueno, with a Den Den Mushi, walks up to Franky while Lucci speaks saying that their superior wants to speak to him. As Blueno tells the ""chief"" to speak, the man says he has spilled coffee on himself. However, he soon gets serious but is surprised to hear from Franky again. The man is surprised to see that Franky is still alive but Franky doesn't recognize the voice. The man continues saying how for eight years, his scars have been hurting but Franky demands to know who is talking to him. The man turns out to be Spandam saying he is the same person who arrested Tom's Workers years ago.","Roronoa Zoro, Monkey D.

At the Sea Train station, two men are discussing about the Sea Train's departure before Aqua Laguna hits. One of the men notices that the people boarding the Sea Train are secret agents for the World Government. They continue talking about how they might know the undercover agents and how they are rich. One of the men says that the agents will board the Sea Train soon and will know their true identities. Back at the Galley-La Company, the people are still trying to put out the fire to little success. Suddenly, Chopper rushes out of the building with both Iceburg and Paulie on his back and puts them down gently. Chopper then notices Nami injured and attempts to help her but passes out. The people then tend to the aid of Iceburg and Paulie and then agree to help Chopper since he saved Iceburg and Paulie's lives.
Back at Franky's base, Kaku has just easily defeated Usopp much to Franky's disappointment and embarrassment. Kaku then hears that even though Usopp has left the Straw Hats, he is still living his life as a pirate. Kaku then states that Usopp also has to go to Enies Lobby and orders Kalifa to tie him up. Kaku then turns his attention to the Going Merry upset that Usopp hasn't disposed of it yet. Usopp angrily tells Kaku to stay away but Kaku knocks the Going Merry off of the chain and onto the water. Kaku then says that even though it was a temporary disguise, they are still respected as shipwrights and he opens the doors leading to outside. Usopp says that it's his ship and he can do whatever he wants to it but Kaku pulls down on the lever which causes the Going Merry to move closer into the sea. Usopp attempts to stop him but Kalifa ties him up with her thorny rose and the Going Merry crashes into the sea badly damaged now. Usopp tearfully screams out Merry's name.
Back at the Galley-La Company, the people continue to struggle to put out the fire with the building itself starting to fall into pieces. Suddenly, Iceburg starts to wake up much to the shock and excitement of the people. The people then notice Nami also starting to wake up but are confused on what to do with her. Iceburg is now seen standing and he asks the other people that he needs to speak with Nami alone. Iceburg and Nami are now seen sitting alone and the other people wonder what they could be talking about. However, they continue to focus on putting out the fire as the other foreman are still trapped inside. Iceburg then apologizes to Nami for falsely accusing her and the rest of the Straw Hats and promises to clear it up. Iceburg, however, wants to talk about Nico Robin and asks Nami that when they first came to Water 7 did Robin started acting strangely. Nami agrees saying Robin went into town and never came back and that the next morning, she was the prime suspect in Iceburg's attempted murder. She continues saying that as soon Sanji and Chopper saw her, Robin said it was goodbye and wouldn't return to the crew. Nami then says that she and the others broke into his mansion in hopes of finding out the truth and recalls Robin saying she did it to make her wish come true. Nami then wonders what wish will force Robin to give up her friends and Iceburg says that he may know the answer. Iceburg says it may have happened as soon Robin got separated from the rest of the crew and says there is a good reason she did what she did. Iceburg then tells Nami that he and Robin have the plans to revive an ancient weapon that has the means to destroy the world much to Nami's shock.
In a flashback, Iceburg, still held down, has just told Robin that the blueprints that the other CP9 agents just found are fake and says he will rather die than hand over the real blueprints. Iceburg says if Robin is still searching for the Poneglyphs, then he has to do everything to stop her. Robin says she is only studying the Poneglyphs to learn more of the history of the world and doesn't care about the ancient weapon. Iceburg yells at Robin to take responsibility briefly remembering telling Franky eight years ago that weapons are made to hurt people. Iceburg then says that if Robin is still doing this, then she is better off dying right there and now and mentions Ohara. Robin angrily responds to Iceburg saying he knows nothing of Ohara and continues saying he knows nothing how the World Government has warped her life. Iceburg wonders if Robin hates the World Government so much, then why is she helping them. Robin says it's to make her wish come true and lets go of Iceburg. Robin then tells Iceburg that as soon she came to Water 7, CP9 presented her with two conditions: The first being to pin his assassination on the Straw Hats and leave their crew and the second being to turn herself over to the World Government and follow their every word. Iceburg tells Robin that the World Government won't let her live and wonders why, for escaping them for over twenty years, help them now. Robin then says that the World Government gave CP9 permission to activate a Buster Call against the Straw Hats. Iceburg is confused on the term Buster Call and Robin explains it's an emergency action that summons five Vice Admirals and ten battleships to the same location. She says that no matter how strong you are, nobody is able to survive a Buster Call and says that Admiral Aokiji gave CP9 the right to make the call. She says that as soon she heard his name, she surrendered saying if she hadn't, she and the rest of the Straw Hats would have been annihilated. Robin says she cannot turn her back on the Straw Hats as they helped her out which is why she hasn't run away. Iceburg then wonders what Robin's wish is and Robins says excluding her, the rest of the Straw Hats will be able to leave safely. Iceburg says that as long she has that, she doesn't care what happens to the rest of the world and Robin confirms this. Iceburg then picks up the nearby pistol and prepares to shoot.
The flashback ends with Iceburg telling Nami he couldn't pull the trigger saying he couldn't criticize her. Nami suddenly falls to the ground and tells Iceburg that she is happy that Robin hasn't betrayed them. Nami is eager to tell the rest of the Straw Hats the news saying now that Robin needs saving, she and the rest of the crew will not give up. Nami attempts to roughly wake up Chopper much to the horror of the other people. Meanwhile, at the Train Station, Robin can be seen and an agent is eager to see Robin has finally turned herself in. Not to far away, Sanji can be seen and finally is able to locate Robin again.","Spandam, Franky, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Blueno, Kaku, Kalifa, Usopp, Nami, Iceburg, Tyrannosaurus, Paulie, Tony Tony Chopper, Bushon, Stevie, Klabautermann (flashback), Nico Robin, Tom (flashback), Aokiji (fantasy), Nefertari Cobra (flashback), Nola (flashback), Sanji, Corgi",

He says that CP9 and Robin will be there and continues saying thanks to Aqua Laguna, all of the rest of the Sea Train departures will be stopped. Nami is horrified to hear that especially since they have only half an hour to get to the Sea Train but wonders since Iceburg is the mayor of Water 7, that he can stop the Sea Train. Iceburg tells Robin that the Sea Train is bound for Enies Lobby and is currently being run by the World Government so he has no power over it. Nami concludes that they must make it to the Sea Train and informs Chopper about Luffy and Zoro's locations. Paulie suddenly gets up and tells the people to help out Nami and Chopper. The people disagree still thinking the Straw Hats are responsible for Iceburg's attempted murder but Paulie tells them that they aren't the culprits and should just give up on Lucci and Kaku. Paulie agrees to take Nami to the station and the people ready to get the Yagara Bulls. Iceburg secretly talks with Paulie saying he doesn't want to hurt the people about the truth.

He asks Paulie if there's a ship he could borrow to get them there, or better yet, a sea train. Paulie informs them that the sea train was built by a team headed by a legendary shipwright and there's nothing else like it in existence in the world and if they were to set out, they would immediately get killed so they would do better to wait until morning.
At that moment Nami remembers reading about Enies Lobby and the Gates of Justice - a set of large steel gates beyond which people only find despair. Enies Lobby is known as the Judicial Island and has a judicial court located on it. However, it functions as such in name only; if you're taken to Enies Lobby, you're already considered guilty. Beyond the Gates of Justice lie two locations, one is the Marine Headquarters and the other is Impel Down - an undersea prison reserved for the criminals who once ran amok in the world. Robin, who has a bounty on her head, would only suffer pain once she crossed those doors.
Paulie tells them that they shouldn't go there because they are pirates too and would get caught. Luffy declares he is going and he would steal a ship to get there. Paulie and Luffy are about to fight, when Kokoro stops them and asks Luffy to follow her if they didn't fear death.
Sanji gets to the railcar where Franky and Usopp are tied up and after defeating all the officers inside, Sanji and Franky get into an argument that Usopp unsuccessfully tries to stop. There are several Den Den Mushi there which Sanji plans to use to call Nami.

Nami comes there bringing with her the two conductors who are carting in meat and drinks, and both Zoro and Luffy dig in and thank her. While he is eating, the Franky Family members come in and beg Luffy to be let to ride with them to go and rescue Franky. While Nami opposes, Luffy just tells them to get in; however, they would ride on king bulls and need only hold on to the train as it went.
The gang get on and the train is ready to depart with Kokoro piloting the Rocketman as she tells Iceburg to rest up, and that Franky would be okay, as he got hit by a Sea Train and survived.

Zambai thanks Luffy for allowing them to come and fires the connection cannons that link their ship with Rocketman. Zoro yells at them for almost hitting him. Luffy asks Kokoro if Rocketman can go any faster and Kokoro says it will once they reach the railway. Kokoro then spots the railway and attempts to get the Sea Train onto them but it keeps moving away much to her annoyance. Suddenly, Chimney and Gonbe are seen on the front much to the shock of Kokoro who thought they stayed with Iceburg.

However, Franky is angry that Iceburg is building ships for the World Government after what they did to Tom years ago. Iceburg angrily tells Franky about who made the weapons that caused the incident in the first place. Iceburg continues saying he has never forgiven Franky even after Tom forgave him. A little while later, Iceburg is seen giving the blueprints to Pluton to Franky and tells him not to call himself ""Cutty Flam"" anymore knowing the World Government will be targeting him. He then tells Franky to leave Water 7 but Franky is worried about the World Government going after Iceburg. Iceburg, who has broken in tears, says he is glad that Franky is alive. Franky then yells out to Iceburg saying he won't leave Water 7 and Iceburg yells back at him saying it's to protect the blueprints.
Back in the present and on the Sea Train that is heading for Enies Lobby, Franky can be seen climbing onto the top of it.  Franky wonders why he is thinking about Iceburg but is worried about Lucci telling him he's dead. In Rocketman, Luffy, Chimney, and Gonbe are brought inside after nearly dying.

Zambai speaks up saying that the enemy is also the one that kidnapped Franky. Lulu and Tilestone then tell Paulie to tell them who are the culprits on Iceburg's attempted assassination saying they won't be shocked on who they are. Paulie says that the culprits are Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa, and Blueno but, to his anger, Tilestone and Lulu are greatly surprised at this thinking the culprits were someone else. Luffy suddenly speaks up saying that even though they got into a fight with Galley-La Company and the Franky Family earlier, they all share a common enemy. Luffy says that the strongest of the group and Lucci and that he is going to be the one that fights him. Zoro says that it's a battle against those four.

They miraculously pass through unscathed, and the passengers rejoice. Sanji contacts the rest of the crew and fills them in on his current situation. Usopp separates from them but later, when Sanji and Franky are spotted, a man named Sogeking comes to their rescue.","A large wave of Aqua Laguna is about to hit Rocketman and Kokoro asks how everyone else is going to take care of it.

Sanji then tells Luffy that he was informed by Nami on why Robin surrendered and Luffy tells Sanji to ""give them hell"". Zoro speaks up saying that Sanji will die and tells Sanji to wait until everyone else has caught up but Luffy suddenly stops Zoro saying what would he do in Sanji's cause. Zoro looks away silently (knowing he will do the same) and Luffy tells Sanji to go save Robin. Sanji is surprised that Zoro is worried about him but Zoro angrily tells Sanji that he hope he gets killed. Sanji says he will fight to free Robin and crushes the phone. Franky is upset saying he wanted to speak with Luffy but Sanji just tells him to ""deal with it"". Nami wishes for Sanji's safety while Luffy wants Rocketman to go even faster despite Kokoro saying Rocketman is already at top speed.
Back on the Puffing Tom, Usopp is talking about how much things have changed since he left the crew. Sanji is upset that while they were fighting among themselves, Robin surrendered to the World Government so that the crew will be safe, including Usopp (even though he left the crew at that time). Franky is crying to hear such a sad story much to Sanji's disdain. Franky thought Robin was evil but now knows that deep down, she is kind. Sanji says he has to save Robin and Franky agrees to help him out. Franky tells Usopp to help out as well but Usopp says he isn't coming. Usopp says that, even though he feels bad for Robin, he isn't a part of the Straw Hat Pirates anymore and shouldn't get involved in saving her. Usopp then walks off with Franky yelling at him to talk it over. Sanji tells Franky to leave him much to Franky's annoyance. In the train cars, T Bone and the Marines are trying to look for the missing criminals. One Marine asks Wanze to help out but the cook angrily tells him to leave while Nero is also informed on the escape. One Marine notices the window is open and looks up to find Sanji and Franky up there. Suddenly, the Marine is shot into the water and Sanji and Franky turn to the shooter wanting to know who he is. The man says he has come to help out and introduces himself as Sogeking (who is really just Usopp in disguise).","Kokoro, Zambai, Kairiki Destroyers, Tamagon, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Chimney, Gonbe, Monkey D.

Episode 258,A Man of Mystery Appears!? His Name is Sogeking!,5-Mar-06,"Sogeking makes his grand appearance. Franky and Sanji aren't fooled by his costume but they try to humor him. They devise a plan first, then detach the last two cars and fight their way through the rest. Back in the Rocketman, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper get an outfit change; Nami shows off the weapon Usopp upgraded for her while he was still with them.","Sogeking introduces himself to Sanji and Franky and his theme song plays. Sogeking continues singing his theme song but Sanji and Franky aren't fooled by Usopp's disguise. Franky wonders why Usopp is dressed up like that and Sanji says that Usopp has too much pride to show his face to the rest of the crew but still wants to help save Robin. Franky tells Sogeking to come over and Sogeking does. Sanji then begins a meeting for a plan to save Robin. Sanji says that they must find out which train car Robin is in while Sogeking asks if they want to know where he's from. Sanji asks Franky if he's strong and Franky says of course even stating he's been stronger lately. Sanji says that the objective is to save Robin and everyone agrees. Sanji then says he has a plan and tells it to Franky and Sogeking.
On board Rocketman, Tilestone, Peepley Lulu, and Zambai all witness Nami changing her clothes in front of them. Paulie angrily tells Nami to cover herself better and tells Mozu and Kiwi to do the same. However, they tell Paulie that he is too shy and Paulie seethes in anger. Kokoro offers to change as well but Tilestone, Lulu, and Zambai quickly reject the offer. Luffy is seen trying to stuff meat into his new black shorts but Nami tells him not to. Kokoro believes that they can pull it off and Luffy says he has a reason to beat them now. Zoro notices that Nami has a new weapon and Nami says that it's the Perfect Climate Tact that Usopp modified before he left. Nami and Luffy sigh in disappointment from Usopp's last work and Zoro angrily tells them not to get depressed.
Back on the Puffing Tom, Sanji, with Franky and Sogeking, prepares to put his plan into motion and Corgi informs Rob Lucci that there is an intruder on board. Lucci says it's an embarrassment that they allowed someone to sneak on-board but that person cannot get off once the train has started moving. Lucci tells Corgi that the intruder and the missing prisoners are still somewhere on the train and they must look for him. In train car 6, T Bone and the other Marines are still trying to look for Sanji, Franky, and Sogeking. Suddenly, a knock is heard on the door and Sanji, Franky, and Sogeking all say ""Good evening"" before closing the door again. The Marines hurry to open the door while Sogeking tries to hammer nails into it to slow them down. T Bone suddenly speaks up saying he will handle the door. T Bone uses his technique Chokkaku Senko: Bone Soir to slice up at the door.
The door flies off from the attack but Sanji, Franky, and Sogeking already have escaped. T Bone suspects they head up the roof and climbs up to see that they are already on top of train car 5. T Bone knows what they are about to do and tells the Marines to get onto the other side quickly. However, it is too late as the door is locked and the train cars are detached. Sanji is glad that the plan work and Sogeking wonders if Luffy and the others will run into the detached train car. Sanji says that they will come up with something and, before heading into the next train car, opens it and a government agent comes flying out. Sanji, along with Franky and Sogeking, enter inside and some World Government agents confront them. Sanji takes out some of them with Frit Assorti while Sogeking fires his Gunpowder Star at some of them and Franky uses Strong Right on more of them. A couple of agents fire at Franky but it doesn't go through him. Franky then throws a long chair at the agents knocking them out. Sanji and Sogeking are surprised that the gun shots didn't go through him and wonder what he is. Franky tells them that he is a cyborg and Sanji is surprised to hear they existed. Sogeking, excited, pokes Franky in the back with a needle and Franky yells in pain waiting to know why Sogeking did that. Sogeking is surprised to see that gun shots don't affect him but needles hurt. Franky says that his back isn't the same as his front due to him doing the operation on himself. Franky then shows his fridge which impresses Sanji and Sogeking. Sanji says that they must continue on.
Sanji, Franky, and Sogeking reach train car 4 and they are greeted by an erratic cook named Wanze. Wanze speeds in and offers to make them some ramen by eating flour then spreading out the noodles from his nostrils. Wanze offers it to them but Sanji, Franky, and Sogeking quickly reject. Sanji says that they must continue on but Wanze gets in his way saying they must go through him first. Wanze says that Robin is an important prisoner and, to rescue her, must defeat his Ramen Kenpo. Sogeking questions Ramen Kenpo but Wanze mocks him angering Sogeking. Sanji tells him to calm down and Franky tries firing at Wanze. However, his shots missed and Franky is shocked to see that Wanze easily dodged the shots and is even smiling about it. Wanze says he thought his heart was going to leap out of his chest and this annoys Franky. Franky and Sogeking both want to fight Wanze but Sanji calms them down and tells Wanze that if he as a real chef, he would conduct himself with more dignity. Wanze mearly looks the other way and an annoyed Sanji attempts to kick him. Sogeking comments how Wanze dodged the kick and even is smiling about it. Wanze says he thought he was going to die and both Franky and Sogeking tell Wanze to stop making that face. Having enough, Sanji tells Franky and Sogeking to go on ahead while he deals with Wanze.","Sogeking, Tyrannosaurus (Sogeking Song), Franky, Sanji, Peepley Lulu, Zambai, Tilestone, Nami, Paulie, Mozu, Kiwi, Kokoro, Monkey D.

The episode ends with Sogeking's theme song being cut off before it starts.","Kalifa and the rest of CP9 has just been informed by a government agent that the rear two cars have been detached. Kalifa asks how could they let that happen but the agent tries to defend himself saying even T Bone has been beaten. Kalifa wants a status report and the government agent says that there are still five cars left but the Marines and World Government agents have been taken out in the fifth car. He says that Wanze is guarding the fourth car, Nero in the third car, Nico Robin in the first car, and everyone else in the second car. Rob Lucci suddenly speaks up saying their enemy shouldn't be taken likely but Lucci says that the only problem now is that Franky is running loose. Lucci says that Robin and Franky will be delivered securely to Enies Lobby and he doesn't care how many men they will lose. Kalifa asks if the intruders were identified and the agent says that two of them were the prisoners but one of them is now wearing a strange mask. He also says that there is a blonde guy in a suit that he has never seen before. Kaku concludes that the intruder is a member of the Straw Hat Pirates knowing he is trying to rescue Robin and that Franky is helping them out. Blueno offers to watch over Robin but Lucci says it isn't necessary and that they should focus on recapturing Franky. Lucci then says that rescuing Robin will not happen.
In train car 4, Sanji tells Sogeking and Franky to go on as rescuing Robin is the top priority. However, Wanze isn't about to let them go so easily and eats a bunch of flour. Sogeking fears more nose noodles but Wanze fires a bunch of sharp noodles (Ramen Beam) toward Sogeking and Franky who both barely dodge. Sanji attempts to attack Wanze but the noodle cook dodges it. Sogeking and Franky then move on to the next train car but Wanze says that Nero will be waiting for them. Sanji attempts to attack Wanze with Flanchet Shoot but Wanze continues dodging his attacks. Meanwhile, Sogeking's theme plays again and he is standing on top of Franky trying to figure out how to get to Robin's car quickly. Franky, annoyed, tells Sogeking to go and calls him a ""Stupid Slimy Squid King."" Sogeking yells back at him but gets an idea from hearing ""slimy squid"" and tells Franky he has a plan. Sanji and Wanze continue their fight but Sanji grows annoyed by Wanze dodging all of his attacks. Wanze then activates his Men-Kiri Hono Hocho and attempts to attack Sanji with a fiery kick but Sanji blocks it with some kicks. Wanze suddenly screams in pain after being hit twelve times by Sanji. Wanze wonders if Sanji is strong but says that Sanji's swirly eyebrows made him dizzy. Wanze then eats a bunch of more flour and uses Ramen Kenpo Ogi: Men's Formal Suit to make a fighting suit out of ramen. Sanji is angry at Wanze for using food to fight but Wanze says he is a lot stronger now. Sanji promises to make Wanze eat all those noodles.
On top of the Puffing Tom, Franky is seen being confronted by Nero. Franky asks why Nero is waiting on the roof as he would've come inside instead. However, Nero knew that Franky would just skipped past the car. Franky knows that Nero must keep his guard up and suddenly tells Nero to look the other way. Nero does so and Franky attacks him from behind with a punch. Nero says that was a dirty trick and Franky says he isn't the king of Water 7's Underworld for nothing. On the Rocketman, Luffy once again gets onto the top of it. Nami wonders where Luffy went and Zoro is clueless as well. Nami, Zoro, and Chopper wonder what happened to him while Luffy continues going further onto the Sea Train. Luffy eats a piece a meat and says that they're coming for Robin (as Usopp too).
Sanji and Wanze prepare to begin their fight and Wanze attacks with Tonkotsu Spank. Sanji dodges and says it's just the same weak punch but bigger. Wanze attacks again but when Sanji attempts to kick the attack, his foot gets stuck in the noodles. Wanze begins to slam Sanji around in the room and taunts Sanji saying how his noodles are effective. Wanze becomes dazed from staring at Sanji's eyebrows but quickly snaps out of it and viciously slams Sanji to the ground. Wanze then crushes Sanji with Men Soul Press and continues slamming across the room. Sanji is free of the noodles but Wanze continues taunting him and closes in. Wanze attempts to attack Sanji with Ramen Gyoza Set - Clapping but Sanji moves out of the way. Sanji knows the only part to attack Wanze and aims for Wanze's head with Escalope but Wanze fires his Ramen Beam to knock Sanji back. Wanze then prepares to finish Sanji off using Fukumen Spank but Sanji pick up a couple of kitchen knives to chop away at the attack. Wanze is angry that Sanji has chopped up his noodles. Sanji says that a chef must fight without using their hands or knives but Sanji says that since he and Wanze are in a kitchen and that Wanze is using food to fight, the rules change. Wanze attempts to attack Sanji with Senmen Muchi but Sanji dodges it and Wanze yells at him. Sanji apologizes but tells Wanze he is going to show how a real chef handles his kitchen knives.
Back on the roof of the Puffing Tom, Franky and Nero continue their battle. Nero gets in close using Soru but as Franky attempts to attack him with his Strong Hammer, Nero dodges it using Kami-e. Nero uses Rokushiki/Rankyaku on Franky but it seems to have not affected him much surprising Nero. Franky strikes back using Fresh Fire but Nero dodges it by jumping toward the sea but uses Geppo to get back on the Sea Train. Franky wonders how Nero jumped in the air like that and Nero is wondering how the Rankyaku didn't affect Franky. Franky and Nero then charge in at another and both want to know what the other is. Meanwhile, Sogeking is seen on the other side of the Sea Train wearing octoshoes. Sogeking then taps on Robin's window and Robin, seeing Usopp through the disguise, is surprised to see him and wants to know why he is there. Sogeking smiles as his theme plays off.","Kalifa, Kaku, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Blueno, Corgi, Sanji, Wanze, Sogeking, Franky, Nero, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

Those on the Rocketman encounter the discarded cars, and Zoro slices through them so they can pass.","In train car 4 of the Puffing Tom, Sanji taunts Wanze and Wanze comments how Sanji sliced up his ramen suit. Wanze comments how he is CP7's ""ace"" and says he will do everything to ensure Robin isn't saved. Wanze then attacks with Menkui Knocker but Sanji easily cuts up the attack using the kitchen knives. Sanji gets in close and manages to cut up the ramen suit upsetting Wanze. Sanji comments on how even though Wanze is a cook that makes ramen from his nose, he knows how to take care of his kitchen knives.
On the rooftop, Nero is seen trying to attack Franky but he puts up his Star Shield to block the attack. Nero is wondering what is with Franky's body knowing a real human cannot do that. Nero notices that Franky is breathing in air again and thinks it's fire but it turns out to be a bunch of nails (Master Nail). Nero uses Geppo to dodge the attack and says that even though he hasn't mastered the Shigan, he still has another plan. Nero then takes out two pistols but Franky attempts to run away and Nero follows. However, Franky quickly turns around and fires Weapons Left but Nero dodges it saying he saw the attack coming. Nero then fires his pistols at Franky's back and it causes harm to him. Nero smirks and attempts to attack Franky from behind with Rankyaku but Franky barely dodges it. Nero then tells Franky he knows that his back is his weakness but Franky says he has something to block his weakness. Franky lays flat on the ground using Franky Invincible but Nero comments how ridiculous the move is.
In train car 1, Sogeking enters and Robin wants to know why he is there. Sogeking sits across from her and introduces himself to her. Sogeking then tells Robin that he is here to save her and Sanji and Franky are helping out. Sogeking also tells Robin that Luffy and the others are following behind shortly on another Sea Train with a small army. Sogeking, knowing the agents in the train car behind them are strong, attempts to flee with Robin without having to confront them. Sogeking then asks Robin to come with him but Robin refuses. Sogeking gets up and says that the situation changed saying they know what is really happening after being informed by Iceburg, he is also encircled in a metaphoric blue flame, representing the dying merry. However, it dies down very quickly. Robin still says she isn't going with him but Sogeking (now talking in his Usopp voice) says that the Straw Hats wouldn't let this go. Sogeking tells Robin that know they know what really happened, they will follow her to the depths of Hell if they have to, making the blue flame larger and more vehement. Robin angrily tells Sogeking that even if she could be saved that she wouldn't go with them, making the fire disappear. Suddenly, Corgi enters the room telling Robin to calm down. Sogeking has secretly hidden himself within Robin's coat and Robin tells Corgi she is fine (while Sogeking comically makes rabbit ears and other goofy hand gestures). Corgi is shocked to see Robin's reaction and comical goofy-ness, but think he's imaging things. Back on the roof, Nero yells at Franky to get up and fight fairly. Franky says he isn't quitting and tells Nero it's bad luck for him. Franky tells Nero that he is ""super"" this week and it's not a good time to make him angry. Franky then asks Nero if he has ever heard of a creature known as a Centaur and Nero says he has. Franky then modifies his body and converts to the Centaur Mode. Nero yells at Franky saying it's backwards but Franky says he will beat him up.
In Rocketman, Luffy asks where is ""Bashing Tom"" but Nami corrects him saying it's Puffing Tom. Nami tells Luffy to come inside as he is getting wet but Luffy wants to remain up there. Meanwhile, the others are messing around while Zoro yells at them to stop screwing around. Tilestone and Zambai tell Zoro that they are bored and Zoro tells them to do something else. Paulie says he tried to tell them the same thing earlier but they wouldn't listen to him. Suddenly, Luffy speaks up saying that there is another train in front of them.

Corgi, however, says it's not his imagination and can smell out pirates. Corgi suddenly starts walking back toward Robin much to Sogeking's dismay. In train car 4, Wanze can be heard screaming loudly thinking Sanji has cut him with the kitchen knives. Wanze is relieved that he isn't cut and Sanji says that kitchen knives aren't for cutting people and shouldn't be used as swords. Sanji then puts the knives away and, as he turns around, Wanze attempts to hit him by throwing knives at him (Hocho Nage). Sanji dodges and angrily kicks Wanze in the face. Wanze worries his eyes are being pushed in but still wants to fight. Wanze taunts Sanji saying why would he save such a ""terrible women"" and that she has everyone fooled. Sanji kicks Wanze in the face multiple times treating to rearrange his face. Wanze asks Sanji not to do so but taunts him saying that Robin is better off dead. Sanji furiously kicks Wanze over and over in the face (Parage Shot) and sends Wanze flying backwards. Wanze gets up and, after looking at a frying pan, his face completely got rearranged. Wanze yells at Sanji for messing up his face but Sanji then tells Wanze he is guilty of three sins: Wanze called himself a ""chef"" in front of him, he was disrespectful toward his food, and that he insulted his friend. Sanji promises to make Wanze pay.

It is not long before Blueno pulls their car back, though. Franky knocks down the wall so they can escape but ends up on the enemy car. Blueno opens a door back in the Straw Hat Pirates' car.","Sanji and Franky have just defeated their opponents and enter train car 2 where the CP9 agents are. Kalifa comments on how loud it has gotten and Blueno and Kaku say how they underestimated the intruders. Franky warns Sanji that CP9 uses some ""weird moves"" and Rob Lucci walks toward Nero kicking an unconscious Wanze away. Lucci wants to know who the man is and Kaku says that according to Corgi, he's the newest member of CP9: Nero. However, Kaku says that Nero only knows four of the six powers and Nero gets up saying how he is going to take down Franky. Lucci speaks up and Nero recognizes him. Nero apologizes for not introducing himself but decides to kill Franky. Lucci says that Franky must be kept alive and that Nero has let his emotions get the better of him. Lucci says that he'll give Nero three seconds to try and escape but Nero nervously says he doesn't know what's happening.
Lucci reaches ""3"" and Nero attempts to run away using Soru but Lucci quickly catches up to Nero and stabs him in the back using Shigan. Lucci says that in order to be a member of CP9, one must master all of the six powers and sends Nero crashing out the window and into the water. Lucci then tells Kalifa in their report, Nero was too weak to be a member. Sanji is surprised at what just happened and Franky says that he can't tell what side is evil. In train car 1, Corgi continues sniffing at Robin. Robin comments on how Corgi has bad matters but Corgi says he's just doing his job. Corgi notices a pair of legs and tells the pirate to come out. Sogeking comes out and pulls his weapon at Corgi's face. Sogeking introduces himself and Corgi says that he won't get away with that. Corgi attempts to run away calling for Lucci's help but gets shot down by Sogeking. Lucci knows that Sanji is there to save Robin but says it's a mistake. Lucci then says that some people were born better off dead and also says that a sleeping devil exists. Lucci asks Sanji that even if that person is an eight-year-old child, that person should be put to death. Sanji tells Lucci to get to the point and Lucci says that was the story of Robin he just told. Lucci says that the only good Robin can do is to die, as her life is an entire curse. Lucci says that she should've died twenty years ago but her dying soon is good enough. Sanji angrily kicks at Lucci who easily blocks it and Sanji doesn't want to hear anymore. Lucci adds that the World Government will likely spend several years interrogating and tormenting Robin to extract and erase all her secrets.  Sanji says that he will not let that happen but, suddenly, Robin with Sogeking enter into train car 2. Sanji is excited to see Robin again and says he'll beat up CP9 and they can escape together. However, Robin uses her powers to send Sogeking flying and Sanji asks why she did that. Robin stares on with a blank expression after saying to Sanji that her words mean nothing to him.
Sanji, Franky, and Sogeking are shocked at Robin's reaction and Lucci starts laughing evilly. Sogeking suddenly tells Franky to detach the train cars telling Franky and Sanji to run. Sogeking tosses down a smoke bomb that actually stuns CP9. Taking advantage of the distraction, Sogeking grabs Robin and runs toward the previous train car. Sanji and Franky compliment on Sogeking's plan and Sogeking makes it onto the train car with Robin. On board the Rocketman, Luffy can be heard saying to ""turn back."" Everyone inside is confused on why Luffy wants to turn back and wants him to explain himself. Luffy said he wasn't talking about them and was talking to the large frog that hop on the train tracks. Kokoro recognizes Yokozuna and wonders why he is out there. Luffy continues telling Yokozuna to move out of the way but Yokozuna stands his ground and prepares to knock away Rocketman.
Back on the Puffing Tom, Sogeking happily says how they got Robin back. However, Franky doesn't like to run away and Sanji says how the smokescreen was so stupid, it caught CP9 by surprise. Sogeking says that the plan to not fight CP9 worked but Sanji and Franky say it was too easy. Suddenly, the train car is caught by Kalifa's thorny whip and Blueno pulls them in. Lucci reminds Blueno not to kill any of the Straw Hat Pirates as it was in the agreement. Sanji tells Sogeking to protect Robin and Sanji delivers a swift kick to Blueno. However, Blueno uses Tekkai to block it. Sanji then spins on the ground and delivers a powerful kick (Concassé) that stuns Blueno. Kaku comments on how strong the kick was and warns Blueno that even though Sanji doesn't have a bounty, he is one of the Straw Hat Pirates' main fighters. Suddenly, Robin knocks out Sogeking using Ocho Fleur Clutch telling him to leave her alone. Sanji looks away and Kaku, taking advantage of the distraction, fiercely kicks Sanji away. Franky, annoyed but touched at Sanji's actions, uses his strength to push away the train cars leaving himself with CP9. Kaku comments on how that was uncalled for and Lucci asks why Franky would help the Straw Hats out. Franky says he couldn't take it anymore saying that Sanji and Sogeking wouldn't leave without Robin. Franky yells out to Sanji and Sogeking that he has a plan but tells them to find a way to get back to Luffy and the others. Robin says she is not trying to run away but Sanji doesn't understand why she would continue to listen to CP9. Sanji says he knows why she did what she did and, even if it's a Buster Call, they will fight. Suddenly, Blueno appears behind Sanji using his Doa Doa no Mi powers and tells Sanji that if there is a Buster Call, they will be obliterated.","Kalifa, Blueno, Kaku, Rob Lucci, Sanji, Franky, Hattori, Wanze (K.O.), Nero, Corgi, Nico Robin, Sogeking, Sodom, Gomorrah, Monkey D.

Episode 263,The Judiciary Island! The Full Picture of Enies Lobby!,30-Apr-06,"Nico Robin willingly follows Blueno into his improvised door, and Sogeking and Sanji are left alone. For a while, Blueno explains a little of Robin's past involving the Buster Call. Back at the Rocketman, Yokozuna the frog jumps onto the front of the train, knocking them from the rails. After Kokoro speaks with him, he joins the group. CP9, Franky, and Robin finally reach Enies Lobby and disembark.","Blueno appears behind Sanji using his Doa Doa no Mi powers and uses Rankyaku to send Sanji flying backwards. Robin and Sogeking watch in horror as Sanji almost slides off the train car. Sogeking wonders how Blueno did that and Blueno slowly starts walking toward them. Sogeking stands in Blueno's way but as Sogeking briefly talks with Robin, Blueno disappeared. Blueno suddenly appears behind Sogeking and Sogeking turns around in horror.
Franky is surprised that Blueno disappeared but Rob Lucci explains it's because of Blueno's Doa Doa no Mi powers that allows him to create doors even in the air itself (Air Door). Blueno uses Shigan onto Sogeking and Sogeking falls to his knees. Sogeking demands Blueno to let Robin go but Blueno stabs him again with Shigan. Sogeking falls to the ground and Sanji attempts to attack Blueno but he uses Tekkai to block. Blueno comments on Sanji's weaker kick and viciously slams Sanji to the ground. Blueno attempts to attack Sanji again but Robin holds him back using her powers saying she promises that she won't escape and not to hurt them. Blueno says that they keep attacking him and Robin urges him to leave before Sanji and Sogeking gets up again. Sogeking suddenly speaks up saying they will be alright and knows she is still hiding something. Sogeking there is one last thing and that is a pirate isn't allowed to leave their crew without their captain's permission. He then says she can always believe in Luffy. As Robin heard his statement, Robin suddenly remembers an island being destroyed. Blueno kicks away Sogeking and Robin enters through the air door. Sanji calls out to Robin but Blueno cuts him off saying she wouldn't break their agreement. Sanji wants to know why and Blueno explains that, long ago, an island was erased. He continues saying that the Navy issued a Buster Call that completely wiped out the island and that Robin was the only survivor who was a child at the time. Sanji is shocked to be hearing this and Blueno says that Robin was living with that nightmare for years. Sanji angrily says that they knew and are just using her and Blueno says that of course they knew and it's for the sake of justice. Sanji angrily tries to kick Blueno but he already disappears behind his air door. Sanji yells out that it isn't over. Back in train car 2, Lucci tells Robin to take a seat as they will arrive in Enies Lobby shortly. Franky, wanting to know what's going on, follows Robin and Kalifa wonders if it's a good idea to let Franky go into the train car with Robin. Lucci says that there is nothing they can do as they almost reached their destination and all they can do is await their execution.
Back on the Rocketman, Luffy angrily yells at Yokozuna for derailing the train and demands an apology. Yokozuna yells back at Luffy but Luffy starts attacking him threatening to eat him. Yokozuna slams Luffy backwards and, inside, Paulie wonders what is going on. Everyone else are shaken up and Zambai notices that his King Bulls are gone with the rest of the Franky Family. Paulie says that they're the ones that disappeared as their train got derailed. Everyone is suddenly shocked that Zoro is sleeping while Kokoro gets the Sea Train in control. Zambai asks Kokoro if they will be okay and Kokoro tries to get the Sea Train back on course. Nami asks Kokoro if they know which direction to go and Kokoro says of course as the Sea Trains are built with external poses that always point to the other island's stations. Nami says she will watch the sea as she is a navigator and Kokoro is glad to hear it. Kokoro then yells at Yokozuna to get over to her and Yokozuna does. Kokoro talks with Yokozuna knowing he was just trying to protect her but Kokoro informs him that the pirates didn't kidnap her. Everyone is surprised that Kokoro is talking to a frog and, meanwhile, the Franky Family are trying to look for everyone else. Suddenly, one of the members spots a lone train car and prepare to fight. However, upon closer examination, they spot Sanji.
Back on the Puffing Tom, Kalifa informs an Enies Lobby associate that they will be arriving soon. Lucci says how he feels nostalgic about returning to the ""nightless island."" In train car 1, Franky is shocked to hear the Iceburg is still alive. Robin tells Franky that CP9 still believes they killed him and that Franky should keep quiet about it. Franky says that Robin acts tough but she does have a heart. Franky then says that the World Government has got what they want: the only women that has the know-how to bring back an ancient weapon and the man with the only known blueprints for one. Franky continues saying if the government gets hold of those blueprints, the entire world will be turned upside down. Franky says that his master laid down his life to ensure those blueprints wouldn't fall into the government's hands. Franky tells Robin that she must find a way to get back to Luffy but Robin says she can't stay with them, all she will bring is suffering. Franky ensures Robin that she isn't the one that is hurting them but the government is. Franky says that the government may say that Robin's existence is a crime but, no matter how dangerous you are, just being alive and who you are is never wrong. Franky continues saying no matter what you do, you are who you are.
Back on the Rocketman, Kokoro tells Yokozuna it's been eight years since Tom has been taken away. She notices how Yokozuna has challenged the Sea Train every day since then and that Yokozuna wants to get stronger so he wouldn't have to lose the ones he loves again. Kokoro tells Yokozuna it's time to put his training to the test as Franky has been taken away as well. Kokoro asks if Yokozuna is up for a fight and Yokozuna yells out signaling a ""yes"". Kokoro tells Luffy that she found another ally for him and Luffy is glad to hear it. Nami tells Kokoro that she has found a good current to get back on track and Kokoro is determined to get them back on course. Luffy, now on Yokozuna, is ready to go. Meanwhile, the Puffing Tom has arrived at Enies Lobby and the Marines welcome CP9. However, Franky starts to bite on the head on one of the Marines and the rest of the Marines try to restrain him. Robin exits the train as well and Lucci comments on how loud Franky is. CP9 walks down with Franky and Robin and the rest of the Marines and government agents comment on the group. Franky is shocked to see the view of Enies Lobby and notices the waterfall that flows down to nothing.","Sanji, Blueno, Sogeking, Nico Robin, Franky, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Kaku, Kalifa, Monkey D.

Episode 264,Operation Disembarkation Commences! The Straw Hat Crew Rushes In!,21-May-06,"Luffy and the others finally catch up to Sanji, Sogeking, and the rest of the Franky Family as they near Enies Lobby. Sogeking shows off to Luffy and Chopper, which, they both do not see that Usopp is Sogeking. Paulie sits down with the group and talks about their plan. Luffy does not bother to follow the plan, and slingshots himself beyond the gates before the train stops. It also introduces three more members of CP9 - Fukurou, Jabra, and Kumadori.","At Enies Lobby, Spandam is pleased to hear that CP9 is on their way with Nico Robin and Franky. Meanwhile, the Franky Family are trying to catch up to the others on the Rocketman. Sanji just finish telling the other members how Franky sacrificed himself to attempt to save Robin. The members are heartbroken but glad to hear how kindhearted his actions were. Luffy and the others on Rocketman finally catch up to the others and Sanji calls out to Luffy. Luffy notices Sanji but wonders who the other person is (Sogeking). Everyone is prepared for a fight with Zambai informing everyone of it.
At Enies Lobby, Spandam says it's been five years for all eight members of CP9 to be reunited. However, Spandam is furious wanting to know why they assassinate twenty other members of the Revolutionary Army instead of just three. Kumadori suddenly speaks up apologizing saying it's all his fault. Jabra speaks up saying a real man doesn't bow before anybody and agrees to explain what happened. Kumadori says he will take his own life but Jabra speaks up saying they were ready to assassinate as play but the enemy somehow found out about their plan. Fukurou speaks up saying it might have happened when he was talking about the plan all over town and Jabra angrily pulls at Fukurou's mouth. Kumadori says there is no need to blame Fukurou and agrees to take full responsibility. However, he uses Tekkai to stop himself for killing himself much to the annoyance of Jabra. The three other members of CP9 continue to argue and Spandam says he understands before spilling hot coffee on himself. Spandam also says that he heard about Nero didn't work out but he doesn't care.
Back at the Rocketman, Sogeking's theme song plays again and Luffy and Chopper are amazed to see a real life ""superhero"". However, everyone else isn't fooled by Usopp's disguise. Chopper asks for an autograph and Luffy asks what happened to Usopp. Sogeking says that isn't important but what's important is to save Robin. Sogeking, Luffy, and Chopper begin singing and Sanji suddenly tells everyone that they need to know something. Sanji tells everyone about the situation with Robin and that CP9 is using her childhood fears against her. Sanji explains saying he's not using that as an excuse for not saving Robin but Robin may not come with them when they do try to rescue her. Luffy yells out saying it doesn't matter and suddenly blames Robin. Nami hits Luffy on the head saying not to blame her but Luffy says that it is. Luffy says he doesn't care and will do everything to rescue her. Zoro tells Nami to let it go as the main goal is still the same. Luffy says he will beat every one of them saying he has new moves he has to try out.
Paulie suddenly speaks up saying he went to Enies Lobby a while back to do maintenance on the railways and had written a rough sketch of Enies Lobby. Paulie says that the Gates of Justice are located at the far back and they only way to get to them is to go through the Tower of Law. Luffy wonders what is the big hole and Paulie says it's the waterfall. Paulie says that if they don't rescue Robin and Franky before they pass through the Gates of Justice, then it's all over. Luffy says it doesn't matter if Robin passes through them that they will rescue Robin but Nami says that once they pass the gate, the only two places to go are Marine Headquarters or Impel Down. Nami says that they must settle this before Robin passes through the Gates of Justice. Paulie speaks up saying that the Straw Hat Pirates are the only ones strong enough to go against CP9 and says that they should stay behind and give them five minutes before charging ahead. Zambai says that the Franky Family and Galley-La will first break open the main gate so the train can pass through. Zambai knows that the Marines have over 2,000 men but the best chance for victory is for the Straw Hats to go after CP9 while the others take down the Marines. Luffy agrees to this plan and Kokoro speaks up saying they have arrived at Enies Lobby.
Everyone is shocked to see how large the Gates of Justice are and Kokoro says they only open the gates wide enough for the criminals to pass. Kokoro continues saying behind the Gates of Justice lurks Sea Kings where no ships dare to go. Everyone is ready to go and prepare to go along with the plan. However, Luffy has gone missing and the rubberman has already launched himself into Enies Lobby much to the shock, annoyance, and anger of everyone else. Paulie and Zambai thought he understood the plan and Zoro says he should've known Luffy would do that. Zambai orders Sodom and Gomorrah to jump over the fence and break down the gate. Meanwhile, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Rocket to launch himself further into Enies Lobby and the Marines and government agents spot him. Luffy charges forward while Spandam is informed of an intruder. One of the Marines warns the others that the intruder is none other than Straw Hat Luffy and Luffy knocks down some Marines. The Marines are shocked to hear that Luffy is there and Luffy smashes through some more Marines wanting to know where Robin is.","Franky, Blueno, Kaku, Rob Lucci, Hattori, Nico Robin, Kalifa, Spandam, Funkfreed, Kumadori, Jabra, Fukurou, Sodom, Gomorrah, Kairiki Destroyers, Sanji, Sogeking, Kiev, Monkey D.
