Episode 645,Destruction Cannon Blasts! Lucy in Trouble,18-May-14,"The battle royale heats up as more fighters continue to drop one after another and the strongest and most infamous fighters begin to face each other. The standouts among the remaining infamous fighters include Ideo, Jean ""The Bandit"" Ango, the Funk Brothers Kelly and Bobby, the Flower Country's Hasshoken masters and naval warriors Chinjao, Sai and Boo, and finally Lucy, who is becoming a popular underdog.
The audience and commentator Gatz are a mixture of shock and awe by the power and brutality of each fighter's signature skills and techniques, and the question on everybody's mind is which one of these powerhouses will come out on top and earn the right to challenge the other three champions for the Mera Mera no Mi.","Gatz announces with surprise that Hajrudin has been defeated, referring to him as a favored warrior and speaking for everyone when he calls it unexpected. The crowd loves it and starts cheering for Lucy. Meanwhile, Luffy is helping Ucy to safety, saying he is taking the bull to the corner. Cavendish is unimpressed by Luffy's power, while Bartolomeo seems to enjoy the display. Rebecca is completely shocked by Lucy's might. Ideo walks over the unconscious Hajrudin, remarks that the ring is no place for a nap and delivers an explosive punch that propels Hajrudin huge body into the audience stands, panicking spectators before it falls into the water. Gatz was again surprised to see the blasting force of Ideo's punches, referring to him by his epithet ""Destroyer Cannon"". Ideo then declares he will get stronger by eating the Mera Mera no Mi as he blasts away more fighters.
Gatz then turns the crowd's attention to the three fighters from Kano Country, referring to them as famous kenpo users. Sai is then seen shattering a fighter's helmet and shield and knocking him out. Sai is then introduced as the thirteenth leader of the Happo Navy. Gatz refers to the navy's power and centuries of martial experience. Boo is then seen defeating a contender and is introduced as the vice leader of the navy. Chinjao is lastly introduced as the retired twelfth leader of the Happo Navy, while he is being surrounded by a ring of fighters. As the gang attempt to move in on Chinjao, he presses his hands together and knocks out several fighters with Supreme King Haki, stunning the crowd. Other fighters recall his bounty and legendary status as a pirate, and Chinjao turns to them and warns that he is only after one person so they should stay out of his way.
Immediately in front of Chinjao, Jean Ango is seen collecting the weapons of fallen gladiators and thanks Chinjao for incidentally supplying them. He is then introduced as the bounty hunter ""Jean the Robber"". Gatz recalls that Ango is a bounty hunter hated by many pirates in the New World. A fighter charges at him, crying that he won't forgive Ango for sending his partner to jail. Ango simply says that he's a sniper, and the weapons he scavenges are his bullets. He throws a sword clean through the charging man and tells him to attack the prison if he cares so much about his partner, as someone already did two years ago.
Elsewhere, Kelly Funk is mercilessly beating a fighter who is already well past unconsciousness. The crowd dislikes such overkill and shouts at him in disapproval. Bobby tells his brother to stop and tries to grab him but accidentally seizes the victim instead. The brothers are then introduced as killers from the Mogaro Kingdom. Kelly angrily tells his brother the guy he beat up called him a little midget, and asks Bobby for his opinion. Bobby assures him he is not but Kelly once again lays into the unfortunate fighter, and Bobby again grabs the wrong person in an attempt to stop his brother. Kelly finishes his brutal beat down with a threat to gouge the man's eyes out. Gatz mentions that the brothers are notorious in the underworld, adding that the rumor about them is that they were able to handle pirates with bounties exceeding 100,000,000 Beli.
Boo comes up on them, curious to see how a boxer with no formal training fairs against him and immediately sends Kelly Funk flying with a quick jab to the chin. The crowd is stunned by how easily Kelly was sent flying. Gatz once again shows his personal opinion in the commentary, saying that Boo is too strong while one of his booth assistants keeps him from saying more. Boo then turns his sights on Bobby Funk, who reacts fearfully and claims he had never been in a fight, showing his back as Boo swings an axe down on him. To his surprise, the axe shattered, even though he had used Busoshoku Haki to enforce the blade, leaving Boo to wonder how strong Bobby's body is. Bobby tends to his brother, still furious about being mocked for his height, and tells him to ""put it on"". Suddenly, what appears to be a larger, enraged Kelly wearing Bobby's hat turns the tables on Boo, to Sai's consternation, hitting him with a barrage of punches that knocks him unconscious and pummels him on the ground. Gatz cannot tell which brother is actually attacking, guessing that Kelly has transformed into a different person.
Somewhere else, Jean Ango has stolen Luffy's helmet; worrying that his cover is blown, Luffy is forced to use his cape to hide his face and hat. Ango mentions that he heard something interesting about Lucy, and mentioned the rumor that Monkey D. Luffy had snuck into the tournament. Luffy looks to his right and sees Chinjao knocking down fighters to get to him. Gatz announces that about forty people remain in the block, saying it is still anyone's game.","Monkey D.

Kelly Funk's power is revealed but is easily defeated by Sai who prepares to face off against Ideo. Outside of Dressrosa, the Straw Hat Pirates are still dealing with Giolla and the Donquixote Pirates, and back in the Colosseum, the final two of Block C are Lucy and Chinjao, who had just clashed with Haki.","At the Corrida Colosseum, Gatz is heard announcing how Kelly Funk easily took down Boo with his sudden increase in strength. Sai is seen kneeling down to his fallen comarde while Ideo is seen taking out opponents with his explosive punches. Don Chinjao knocks away opponents in a fit of anger while Luffy (as Lucy) is trying to get his helmet back from Jean the Bandit. Chinjao is still chasing after Luffy wanting to get revenge on Garp's grandson and Jean overhears this now knowing Lucy is indeed ""Straw Hat Luffy"". Luffy still chases after Jean and Jean says that he is a bandit and he never returns anything he steals. Luffy almost loses his beard and Jean tries to uncover Luffy more now knowing who Luffy is. Jean starts to attack Luffy by throwing weapons at him but Luffy dodges them all. However, Luffy loses sight of Jean and Jean is seen thinking to himself on how he will win by collecting all of the weapons in the colosseum.
Numerous of competitors are seen getting knocked out of the arena and it turns out to be by Kelly Funk who is using a barrage of punches to send them flying (Rarara Rambo). Gatz wonders where Bobby went and is surprised to see that Kelly has both increased in size and power. A competitor on the ground remembers what happened and a brief flashback is shown where Bobby actually puts on Kelly as a jacket. Kelly then reveals that he ate the Jake Jake no Mi making him a Jacket Human and is able to put his body on the much stronger Bobby to make himself stronger. This was shown how Kelly easily took down Boo. Sai then confronts Kelly saying even though he thinks of Boo as a weaker individual, he is still his subordinate. Kelly attempts to attack Sai with his Rarara Rambo move again but Sai blocks each punch and easily takes down Kelly with a vicious kick. The entire crowd is shocked but pleased at what just happened. Suddenly, Sai is confronted by Ideo who is eager to fight against the strongest man in the colosseum and the two begin to clash.
Just outside Dressrosa, Nami with Momonosuke is seen driving away from Donquixote Pirates on their submarine. Giolla, still on the Thousand Sunny still tells the Straw Hat Pirates to give up. She says that thanks to her Ato Ato no Mi power, she has turned their ship into a work of art and is not able to leave Dressrosa.  Giolla demands them to hand over Momonosuke but, meanwhile, the other Donquixote Pirates wonder where Brook and Chopper went to. Brook and Chopper suddenly appear next to the Donquixote Pirates on their own submarine. Suddenly, weather eggs appear from the sea and hover high above and Nami uses Thunder Breed Tempo to completely destroy the Donquixote Pirates' submarine angering Giolla. Nami then says that no matter how bad the suitation is, they will never leave the Thousand Sunny behind. Nami then tells Brook and Chopper to fight but they both comment they cannot fight in their current form and Brook calls out to Luffy. Back at the Corrida Colosseum, Luffy is seen to be in shocked as Jean the Bandit as collected a large mass of weapons. Jean then challenges Luffy to a battle.
Luffy, knowing he cannot do anything else to hide his identity from Jean, attempts to get his helmet back but Jean tosses weapons at him that miss Luffy but hits the other competitors. Jean continues to toss weapons at Luffy while thanking Luffy for helping him make so much money over the past two years. Luffy (who is dodging all of the weapon throws) is confused by Jean's claims and Jean says he managed to turn over almost all of the prisoners that broke out of Impel Down. Jean says he still intends on turning in Buggy, Jinbe, Crocodile, Ivankov, and Shiryu, intending to make a name for himself. Luffy wonders how Jinbe and Ivankov are doing while Jean continues saying he'll even turn over those that escaped from Level 6 of Impel Down. Jean is surprised that he hasn't managed to hit Luffy yet and continues to throw weapons, this time, with his eyes close. However, when he runs out of weapons, it turns out that some of them got stuck to Chinjao. Jean is horrified at what just happended and an angry Chinjao takes out Jean with a headbutt, eliminating him from the competiton (with Luffy taking back his helmet before Jean was knocked away).
Meanwhile, Ideo and Sai are seen clashing and are evenly matched. Gatz and the crowd are excited to see two warriors battling it out on equal terms. Chinjao is seen finally confronting Luffy, wanting to exact his revenge on Garp by killing his grandson. Luffy still is confused at Chinjao's claims but Chinjao says that killing Garp will be too easy on him and to kill someone he loves will be even greater. Cavendish is seen yelling about not being able to compete in Block C in order to kill Luffy while Bartolomeo looks on. Luffy, seeing no other choice, enters Gear 2 and prepares to fight Chinjao. Luffy says that even if it's not a personal matter, he has to win the tournment so that he will win the Mera Mera no Mi as he does not want anyone else to have Ace's Devil Fruit. Both Luffy and Chinjao charge in, harden their arms with Armament Haki and clash. The force of the punches are so great that it emits a shockwave, knocking away all of the competitors and some of the crowd members.

Episode 647,Light and Shadow - Darkness behind Dressrosa!,1-Jun-14,"In the Colosseum, Chinjao told Luffy that the King of the Pirates is one who conquers all the conquerors in the New World. He then started crying over his lack of memories of what Garp did to him and demanded an answer from Luffy who knew nothing about it.
Outside in the streets, Sanji and Kin'emon are watching Luffy's fight while observing in disguise the numerous marines surrounding the colosseum waiting to arrest any criminal that exits the stadium. However, not a single loser of the battle royales came out, confusing even the present vice admiral Bastille over what's happening inside.
Elsewhere, Thunder Soldier explains that ten years ago when Doflamingo took over the island, he imposed a strict curfew between humans and toys. Confused, Franky asks why would he separate them like that until the toy soldier reveals that every toy in the island were once humans who became forgotten to their loved ones and that Doflamingo brought a Devil Fruit user that caused those transformation.
At Green Bit, Trafalgar Law is barely holding his defense against Issho and Doflamingo's assault. Their battle is felt shaking the Tontatta Kingdom while the dwarves believed it to be Usopp's Haki. When Usopp questions their war with Doflamingo, the dwarves thought it was a joke and explains that 500 of their people including their princess are held as slaves in Doflamingo's dark factory and their goal is to rescue them and destroy the factory revealed to be hidden in the Corrida Colosseum basement, right underneath Luffy's feet.","Don Chinjao is impressed by Luffy's Supreme King Haki. Luffy tells Chinjao that he aims to be the Pirate King and Chinjao scolds him, saying that there are many people in the sea with the right qualities to become king and he must conquer all the conquerors for that to happen. Chinjao asks Luffy who taught him haki and Luffy says it was Rayleigh. Chinjao is surprised that Rayleigh is still alive and hits Luffy, telling him that he doesn't want to remember the past. Don Chinjao starts crying that his treasure was in front of him but he couldn't reach it. Gatz and the crowd are surprised to see the legendary pirate start to cry. Chinjao then angrily demanded answers from Luffy as to what Garp did to him, but Luffy shot back that he should neither cry about it or get angry since Luffy himself had no idea of Garp's life in his golden years.
Meanwhile, Sanji and Kin'emon are watching Luffy's battle from the big screen in town. Kin'emon then asks Sanji to help him to save Kanjuro from the toy house but Sanji says it is too dangerous now as Bastille and the Marines are surrounding the Colosseum. Though the marines surrounded the colosseum since the start of the first battle royale, not a single loser of Block A and B left the stadium, and there was no word of any development from their spy Maynard who was a fighter in the tournament and they worried about any unknowns that could surprise them. The scene switches to the Thunder Soldier explaining to Franky about the two rules imposed by Donquixote Doflamingo since he became king of Dressrosa ten years ago. There is a curfew at midnight. No one can be out after that hour and Toys and humans must not go into each other's houses.
Franky is surprised by this because the toys and the humans get along so well. Suddenly, Esta is seen yelling at a toy, saying that he caught the ""human illness"". The toy insists that he used to be Esta's boyfriend, but Esta's current boyfriend slaps it away and the town soldiers took the toy away to be thrown into the scrap bin. While being carried away, the toy yelled that he's a human to no avail. After that scene, the two then turned their attention to a boy is telling his toy dog Wanpoko to let him ride on him, but Wanpoko refuses, saying that the boy is too heavy. Wanpoko is in truth Milo, and he used to be the boy's father and the husband of the boy's mother. Thunderous Soldier of Rage then asks the mother and son if they have a husband and father, respectively, and they answer that they do not. Franky was clearly confused over this and asked the toy soldier over what is going on here, and the soldier revealed that the toys were forgotten humans who were turned into toys by a Devil fruit user under the employment of Doflamingo's family since he came to power on the island ten years ago. This revelation shocked Franky to the core and asked if the toy soldier was human once, but it told him that he will continue to tell him more as soon as they reached flowerhill.
On Green Bit, the fight is continuing against Law's favor, and Law is failing to contact Nami via Den Den Mushi. In the Tontatta Kingdom, the ground is rumbling from the battle aboveground and Leo is confusing it for Usopp's ""Haki"". Leo then quickly stitches all the furniture in his house to an secure surface. After everything in the house is secured he then leaves the house forgetting that he accidentally stitched his grandma to the shelf as well. Leo asks Usopp and Robin if they are hungry and they reply that they are not. Usopp asks Leo why they want to battle with Doflamingo and Leo answers that 500 dwarves are held captive in the dark factory on Dressrosa, including the kingdom's princess, Mansherry. Leo then shouts that the decisive battle will be in the dark factory, under the Corrida Colosseum.","Monkey D.

Episode 648,Making a Sortie - The Legendary Hero Usoland,8-Jun-14,"Usopp, Robin, and their dwarf allies are preparing for battle with the Donquixote Pirates to rescue their 500 captured dwarf comrades. As they leave, Gancho reveals to the two that the dwarves' past with Dressrosa began over 900 years ago.
Meanwhile in Dressrosa, there exists a field of sunflowers and below the field, Thunder Soldier and Franky are rallying several toys. It is revealed that they are in an alliance with the dwarves. Zoro is there as well and is watching the C block battle royale fight between Luffy and Don Chinjao.
Back at the Sunny, Nami is fending off Giolla but finds her Clima Tact turned into yet another piece of art as Giolla reveals that she ate the Ato Ato no Mi and became an art human. At Green Bit, the fight between Doflamingo and Law is still going on with Law being barely able to keep up with Doflamingo's might.
Back at the Corrida Colosseum, Jesus Burgess approaches Bartolomeo and Cavendish, wondering who ""the little runt"" is.","In the beginning, beneath the Green Bit where lies the Tontatta Kingdom, Leo tells Usopp that there's a subterranean way that connects Green Bit and Dressrosa which they would use as their way of transportation. The dwarf then brings Usopp and Robin to the kingdom's airport, Tontatta Airline (TAL). Both Usopp and Nico Robin are impressed by whole airport system and its transport, which appears to be ridable insects and animals. Kabu and Bian appear, saying that they are ready to take off and that Leo was late. Kabu is revealed to be the Yellow Kabu Squad Leader and the user of Mushi Mushi no Mi, Model: Kabutomushi, allowing him to transform into a rhinoceros beetle. Bian is revealed to be the Pink Bee Squad Leader and the user of Mushi Mushi no Mi, Model: Suzumebachi, allowing her to transform into a hornet. While Usopp seems to be fascinated by the kingdom's insect transport (wishing to show them to Luffy too), Kabu and Bian comments that Usopp and Robin are too big, so the two of them have to ride the Linear Foxes that generally are able to hold 20 dwarves and runs very fast. Usopp comments that the ride makes him feel like a royalty while Robin comments that the foxes' fur is very beautiful. Leo shouts that with the great Usoland by their side, they shall rescue their fellow dwarves.
While they are heading forward, Usopp and Robin suddenly hear a voice. It turns out to be chief Gancho, who came out of Robin's breasts, only to be scolded by Usopp. Gancho says that there was a thing he didn't clarify yet. He first expressed his gratitude for Usopp and Robin's help and he told them that the history between the dwarves and the Donquixote Family started not ten years ago, but dates back even to 900 years ago.
The scene switches to Dressrosa, where beneath a field of sunflowers lays a Dwarf Army, called the Riku Royal Army (or the Anti-Doflamingo Army) led by the Thunder Soldier. He introduces Franky to his brothers-in-arms, the dwarves, who thought of Franky as a strong-looking toy and great aid to the incoming war. Franky appears totally confused by the concept of the dwarves, and Thunderous Soldier of Rage explains to Franky that the dwarves' strength won't lose to his, and with their blinding speed, they are known by the Dressrosa citizens as fairies. Franky is surprised to understand that the ones who took Zoro's sword were actually the dwarves, but he quickly gets distracted by Wicca who screams to Zoro, who is already there and is watching the tournament. Zoro is angry that Luffy didn't bring him along, claiming that his swords are just itching to fight. Wicca is surprised to see her commander and Zoro greets Franky nonchalantly, then the cyborg himself scolds Zoro for what the hell he is doing there. Three dwarves report to the soldiers that the enemy's movements as well as those of ""Sugar"" have been identified.
One of the dwarves reports that two Legendary Heroes have arrived, namely Robiland and Usoland, and he says they are heading over there right now. He states that they have other friends, who are Luffyland, Zoroland, Namiland, Sanland, Chopperland, Fraland and Bonesland. Zoro and Franky thinks to themselves that it is definitely Usopp who is able to tell such lies. The two of them then tell the dwarves that they are Zoroland and Fraland respectively, and the dwarves appears to be amazed by it. Zoro suddenly realize that it is not the time for him to be with the dwarves, and that he must go back to Sunny to save Nami and the others. Wicca says that that was what she was trying to tell him all along.
The scene switches to the Thousand Sunny, where Nami is fighting against Giolla, but clearly she is on the losing side. She tries to release a Weather Egg to produce snow clouds, but her Clima-Tact is transformed into a useless object. Nami seems disgusted by the new form of her weapon, calling it a ""toy"". Giolla angrily asks Nami who she is calling a supermodel, to which Nami replies that she never did. Giolla proceeds to explain that her power is not to turn things into toys, although there is someone like that in the family. She explained that she has eaten the Ato Ato no Mi, which made her an Art Human and allows her to turn things into works of art. On the other side, Chopper's horns have been turned into wings and his hooves into rabbits, rendering him useless. Momonosuke says that they want to capture him, and Brook answers that he would never surrender the boy, but even his Soul Solid has been transformed into art. Giolla yells at the remaining pirates to stop acting like victim and be happy to be turned into an art, despite being angry later that her crews and submarine are badly damaged. Giolla proceeds to ask them which type of Artistic Death Penalty they want to repay her with and a Den Den Mushi starts ringing in the background. Chopper answers the Den Den Mushi: it's Law calling. While Chopper immediately asks Law for help, Law ignores him and orders the crew to reach Green Bit, where he will give them Caesar. After that, he cuts the call. Nami comments that the guy is almost as reckless as Luffy, doing whatever he wants and not listening to anybody.
Outside of the Colosseum, Kin'emon is cheering for Luffy, resulting him to be scolded by Sanji. Kin'emon replies him with his belief that a man must be cheered in order for him to win.
On Green Bit's surface, Doflamingo appears to cut numerous stones and asks a tired Law who he just called, and tells him that he should return Caesar's heart, claiming it is meaningless for him to stay there and buying some time. Also he is informing Law that Luffy fell right into his trap. He says that Luffy is having a lot of fun in the tournament full with the strongest people (mainly outlaws), but the ones who lose in it will fall straight to hell and will never make it out of the tournament. Doflamingo exclaims that their alliance is finished.","Usopp, Nico Robin, Leo, Kabu, Bian, Gancho, Franky, Thunder Soldier, Inhel, Cotton, Baxcon, Roronoa Zoro, Sanji, Monkey D.

Episode 649,The Fierce Battle Coming to the End - Lucy vs. Chinjao,15-Jun-14,"Luffy's battle with Chinjao rages forward as they both use Busoshoku Haki in the ongoing fight. During the match, Chinjao explains and then occurs a flashback when his head was functioning like a powerful drill. After some time, he lost a duel against Garp and had his drill suppressed in his head, which eventually was the main factor towards losing his fame, money, and power.
After the flashback, Luffy and Chinjao prepare for their final showdown. At the ending, Luffy delivers a punch imbued with Busoshoku Haki towards Chinjao's head, bringing back its drill shape. Chinjao falls unconscious and breaks the platform into two as a result of landing headfirst on it. Lucy is declared the winner of Block C.","The crowd is abuzz with excitement and Gatz is amazed with the fight commenting on the speed of the fight and how words are escaping him in trying to describe it, calling it one of the greatest fights ever to take place in the colosseum. Back in the arena, Chinjao is berating Luffy for being like the rest of his generation and having a big head merely because he is labeled as part of ""the worst generation"", saying that they are nothing compared to his generation. Chinjao then surprises Luffy by telling him that he is familiar with Blackbeard, next he tells Luffy that he is not ready to fight with him and that he should just give up on being a pirate. He then goes on to berate Rayleigh for believing Luffy could lead the way for the new generation, calling him out of touch, then he praises the marines for killing Ace, which angers Luffy immensely.
Chinjao then tells Luffy to come down and receive ""a baptism by fire"", saying that with the rage he has built up for Garp in the past 30 years will make Luffy feel the full weight of his strength.
Chinjao proceeds to tell Luffy the events of 30 years ago, where it is revealed that he used to have a pointy head and was once on a continent of ice, which could not be broken by fire or brute force. Some thieves are seen trying to break the ice so they could get their hands upon the treasures that lay beneath, but all of their efforts were fruitless. Chinjao then shows up and told them that to crack the exterior you have to concentrate an incredible force into a single point. He proceeds to do so and actually cracks the ice, sending the robbers pluming in the sudden chasm and onto the sea or treasure. Chinjao then orders his crew to tie up the treasure hunters and to throw them into the sea, he then proclaims that with happiness and fortune, everything he desires in life can be found within the frozen room. The room is revealed to be filled with several hundred years worth of treasure from Chinjao's clan and that the ""key"" to getting into the room is his drill head. Later on a different island, Chinjao and Garp meet and proceed to taunt each other before dueling, Garp throws a Haki-imbued fist to counter Chinjao's Haki-imbued headbutt. Both men seem to put all of their strength into these attacks and Garp comes out the victor when his punch, pushes Chinjao's pointy forehead back into his skull, surprising his crew and forcing them to retreat. After recovering, Chinjao speechless at the lack of a point in his skull, travels once again to the ice continent, only this time he is unable to make the ice crack open no matter how hard he tries, much to his dismay. His crew begs him to stop and he does, crying over the fact that he is no longer able to reach his gigantic wealth, he then curses Garp saying that he will never forgive him or even his grandchildren.
Chinjao finishes his recollections after he had quit being a pirate, but Luffy says that has nothing to do with him as he should talk to his grandfather about his grudge. Luffy finally makes a move and hits Chinjao with a Gomu Gomu no Hawk Rifle on his stomach. The crowd seems to cheer for him while Chinjao appears to cough some blood from the said attack. After Chinjao falls down and hits his head upon receiving Luffy's devastating attack, he quickly gets back up and commends Luffy on his fighting prowess to which Luffy responds that he will not lose to Chinjao.
Chinjao then asks Luffy if he thinks he has what it takes to defeat the admirals, the yonko and succeed Roger. Luffy who has become furious due to these rantings, grabs onto Chinjao's head and uses a Gomu Gomu no Rocket to launch himself upwards, surprising Gatz, the crowd and Chinjao.
Chinjao then makes a silent promise to Garp that he will take his precious grandson's life and while imbuing his skull with Haki, he demands that Luffy repents for what his grandfather had done with robbing him of everything with only one punch. Luffy however is in no mood to take pity on Chinjao, stating that his grandfather had hit him more times than he could count. Chinjao then ascends to meet Luffy's punch with his headbutt and the two forces collide, with Luffy's punch causing Chinjao's skull to grow a point like it had years before, totally astonishing the crowd. The force of Luffy's punch sends Chinjao plummeting towards the colosseum arena and his new point manages to crack the floor, which surprises everyone even more, Chinjao then technically falls out of bounds causing him to be disqualified from the fight, leaving Luffy as the winner of the C block battle royale.
Elsewhere, Cavendish remarks that the next time he meets Luffy, he will not let him get away, though Bartolomeo reminds him that he will not let him kill Luffy, to which Cavendish declares that if he gets in his way he too will suffer his wrath.

As they hide, Luffy overhears Jesus Burgess talking to his captain, Blackbeard, and tells the Emperor that he will not let him have Ace's devil fruit. As Rebecca and Luffy talk, she reveals some of her past.","The winners from the previous blocks of the Corrida Colosseum: Jesus Burgess from Block A, Bartolomeo from Block B and Luffy still in the disguise of Lucy, are mentioned once again. Due to the repairs on the destroyed arena caused by the fight between Luffy and Chinjao, the start of the Block D competition is delayed by fifteen minutes.
As Luffy leaves the ring, Cavendish attacks him with Durandal, but Luffy dodges all the strikes.The fight catches the attention of Bartolomeo, who is annoyed with Cavendish for wanting to kill Luffy. A couple of competitors overheard Cavendish mentioning Luffy's epithet, and mock Luffy not being able to save Ace in the ""War of the Best"". Bartolomeo uses his devil fruit powers to crush the man against a wall, as the man threatens that he is a noble. Bartolomeo grabs the competitors tongue and says that Luffy will become the future Pirate King. He begins to explain his past with the pirate.
Two years ago, Bartolomeo was at Loguetown, when Luffy was about to be executed by Buggy on the same platform where Gol D. Roger was executed. At the last second, a lightning strike hit the sword, destroying the platform and saving Luffy's life. This amazed and inspired Bartolomeo, who started to read every news story about the Straw Hat's actions in the Grand Line. Eventually, after the events at Marineford, he set out to become a pirate, forming the Barto Club. Bartolomeo then threatens the noble's tongue with a knife, before beating him up.
Meanwhile, Luffy manages to grab Cavendish's sword, and the two struggle to overcome one another. Bartolomeo tries to get Cavendish's attention, but is too awestruck by Luffy to speak properly. Chinjao, Sai and Boo, leaving the ring, call to Luffy to thank him for returning Chinjao's drill-shaped head. The old pirate says that he will not hold any grudge against Garp anymore, and bows his head, accidentally splitting the floor.

After escaping from them, Luffy is found by Rebecca, who leads him away. While he is running, Luffy spots Jesus Burgess talking to his captain, Blackbeard. Burgess tells Blackbeard that he cannot trust Aokiji, to which Blackbeard notes the same can be said of their crewmate, Shiryu. After Burgess notifies Blackbeard of Luffy's presence, the Emperor tells Luffy that Burgess will win the Mera Mera no Mi, and brags that it will be just like having Ace in his crew. As Rebecca leads Luffy away, he says to her that Burgess will not win the fruit. He passes by a stall and starts eating, asking if there are any more free samples. Rebecca buys some of them for him, and Luffy thanks her. When they stop to eat, Rebecca tells Luffy that they are in the quarters of the gladiators, and mentions that some of them call it a prison.
When Luffy asks Rebecca if she is hungry, Rebecca remembers some of her childhood. When she was a young girl, she said to her mother that she was hungry, and her mother replied that they have not had anything for two days. Rebecca remembers seeing her dead mother, and replies to Luffy that she does not get hungry. One of the convict gladiators grabs Luffy, and he asks Rebecca what is going on. Rebecca picks up her sword and attacks Luffy. He avoids the attacks and pins her down, without dropping his food. Rebecca tells Luffy that he can do what he wants and that her real intention is to kill him, but he says that she had no intention of killing him. Luffy is surprised by the convict gladiators, since they are all injured and covered with bandages. The convict gladiators tell Luffy that they fought in the Colosseum because they went against the Donquixote Family and according to the king, they will only be released when they win a thousand fights. After hearing this, Rebecca announces her desire to win the tournament and kill Donquixote Doflamingo.","Gatz, Jesus Burgess, Bartolomeo, Monkey D.

Episode 651,Protect You to the End! Rebecca and the Toy Soldier,29-Jun-14,"When Rebecca was little, her mother died when Rebecca said that she is hungry. The two had not eaten for two days because they were on the run from the people hunting down the former nobility. She left Rebecca in the Flower Field, saying that she will be back with food. Unfortunately, she was discovered by the hunters and was killed. The Thunder Soldier carried her mother back, saying that even though he couldn't protect her mother, he will protect Rebecca forever. The rest of Rebecca's childhood is shown, including the two of them living together, and Thunder Soldier teaching Rebecca how to fight.
As Rebecca walks into the arena, she is booed by the audience. Luffy is angered and says that she is a nice person. One of the prisoners replies that everyone despises her because of her grandfather, the former King who destroyed the country many years ago.","As Rebecca lies on the ground sobbing, a bewildered Luffy asks about her sudden breakdown. She then explains to him that her friend, the one-legged soldier Luffy met outside the Colosseum, will soon die. A perplexed Luffy finds such shocking news very strange, though finds that the fact that the toy is alive in the first place is even stranger. Rebecca tells him that Luffy, just as every other newcomer to Dressrosa, cannot fully understand. She proceeds to explain how toys in the country are treated the same as people, capable of befriending the friendless, becoming brothers to those without brothers, and becoming lovers to the loveless. She does note the fact that toys and humans are not allowed to live amongst one another, which she finds confusing. Ever since her mother Scarlett died 10 years ago, ""Mr. Soldier"" out of grief and kindness began to raise Rebecca as his own. Gatz then announces that the arena has been fixed, while the other gladiator prisoners tell Rebecca that the upcoming D block battle royale will soon begin. Rebecca then notices Luffy eating his spilled food off of the ground. He explains that although he spilled his food in the scuffle earlier, he eats it anyway as an apology to Rebecca for having to pay for his food, calling it delicious. Gatz then mentions how the D block battle is full of veterans, and as Rebecca proceeds to enter the arena she tells Luffy that she will meet him in the final match.
As she enters the arena, Rebecca recalls living with her mother as a young girl, specifically a day where she helped her mother sell some flowers and afterwards shared a meal together. She then recalls how the king's palace was ravaged and burned down as she and her mother fled from a younger Diamante and some other members of the Donquixote Pirates. Fortunately, they managed to escape their attackers, finding a place of refuge in some nearby woodlands.
After a while, Scarlett decides to gather food for the both of them, leaving Rebecca behind, though promising to return shortly. Days later, Rebecca hears movement in the bushes, discovering a battered and bruised Thunder Soldier with a bloodied Scarlett in his arms, shocking Rebecca. The Thunder Soldier explains how Scarlett was attacked, and although he tried to protect her, she was ultimately killed. The Thunder Soldier gives Rebecca some food, though she instead begins to cry. The bewildered Thunder Soldier initially does not know what to do, though immediately clamps his hand on her mouth to keep her quiet as Doflamingo's troops storm by, looking for Rebecca. Later on, the Thunder Soldier tells Rebecca that her mother was an important person, and as her daughter, she is also just as important, which is why Doflamingo is after her. He then tells her that since he could not protect her mother, he will protect her, even at the cost of his life. Rebecca is not concerned with herself though, fixated on the death of her mother. She begins to sob for her mother as the Thunder Soldier attempts to cheer her up, all while trying to run back to her old home. The Thunder Soldier, however, realizes that her home has been occupied by Doflamingo's troops by now. Back at the village, Donquixote Doflamingo is shown as the new king, having usurped the throne from the previous Riku family, who had governed for centuries before their usurpation. It is also revealed that in the most recent years, the previous regime of Dressrosa was hated by its subjects for increasingly high taxation. Doflamingo promised to destroy the old ways and bring wealth back to the country.
The Thunder Soldier then tries to take care of Rebecca who resists at first, but over time comes to accept him. He then finds a place for Rebecca to live and tells her that although he cannot live with her, he will always be there beside her. To prove his statement, he will always drop one flower petal every morning from the window into her bedroom. Over the years, the two are very happy together, until Rebecca is kidnapped, forcing the Thunder Soldier to attack her kidnappers and retrieve her. In the process, he becomes a wanted man. The two then find another place to live and Rebecca promises to one day live in the same house as him. Deciding that Rebecca should learn how to fight and protect herself from danger, the toy begins to teach her how to defend herself.
The flashback ends with Rebecca stepping into the ring, thinking about how the soldier always protected her. Gatz then announces her arrival as people jeer and scream at her. Rebecca then hopes for the future and well being of the Thunder Soldier, promising that she will not lose.

Violet then shows up in disguise and informs them of their ship being already taken towards Green Bit.
At the Colosseum, Rebecca is ganged up by five warriors but defeats all of them while tossing them out of the ring declaring she'll win the Mera Mera no Mi and kill Doflamingo.","The audience is still shouting hateful slurs at Rebecca while talking poorly of her grandfather. Luffy says that her being the former king's granddaughter is a moot point, thinking about Chinjao and his own grandfather. The convict gladiators agree with him. One of the competitors gives Rebecca a backhanded compliment, calling her beautiful but an even bigger nuisance than Bartolomeo while another one muses that killing her would make him a local hero. A voice calls out to stop. Cavendish enters the arena, sword drawn, mounted on his horse, Farul. Gatz enthusiastically announces his arrival as women in the audience begin to swoon from his presence. Gatz commenting saying that Cavendish has not lost his touch from three years ago as a spectator calls for Cavendish to make Rebecca suffer. Cavendish waves Durandal at the audience and tells them to shut up. He does not know why the audience hates Rebecca, but she still has the resolve to fight for her life in the ring, which the audience does not. Cavendish tells the audience that they who are not fighting have no right to speak ill of her and anyone who wants to back up their threats should pick up a weapon and step into the ring, adding that the words of those with no resolve fall only as noise against his ears. Cavendish goes on to say that even though he has his reasons to compete this time, he hates contests such as this, believing that a warrior's life is not something that should be used for entertainment. The crowd is visibly moved by Cavendish's speech as he dismisses his horse. Even Luffy was impressed by what Cavendish said, but not enough to start liking him.
The audience's mood has changed and they start cheering for Cavendish as Gatz comments that Cavendish's charisma is palpable. Another gladiator tries to compliment him, saying even though he did not predict the audience would not react this way and that their behavior is quite fickle, however, he does not get to finish his compliment. Cavendish suddenly realizes he suddenly has popularity for the first time in three years, catching the gladiator off guard. Rebecca comes up to Cavendish and thanks him for what he just did. Cavendish tells her he only did it because they irritated him and that she should ignore it because they are now enemies. His imagination then runs away with him, and he asks if there are any reporters nearby, saying it would be ""tragic"" if this event made it into the papers and the press got an interview with him. Gatz announces that everyone in Block D has assembled, a total of 137 people, only one competitor having been dropped prior to the start of the round as the starting bell goes off. The gladiators start fighting as seven of the favored fighters from earlier are shown: Cavendish, Suleiman, Mummy, Rolling Logan, Damask, Orlumbus, and Rebecca.
Meanwhile, Law continues to struggle with Doflamingo and Fujitora. Just as Doflamingo pins him, Fujitora stops him from killing him, stating he wants to arrest Law. Doflamingo then retrieves Caesar's heart and decides to tell Law more about himself.
The scene changes to the Flower Field where Kabu's and Bian's squads have just arrived. Leo declares that the day of reckoning is upon them.

This meant nineteen countries had to elect new royalty and new families were established. He says that the new ruling family in Dressrosa was the Riku Family, while the family that left for Mary Geoise was the Donquixote Family.

At Green Bit, Doflamingo confirms his status as a former World Noble. Law manages to escape Fujitora's gravity and makes a run with Caesar in order to send him to the Straw Hats' ship, and then to stall Doflamingo on the bridge to Dressrosa. Doflamingo, however, sees through his plan and moves to attack the ship, but Sanji intercepts him at the last minute.","On the ship, the Straw Hats and Momonosuke, aboard a restored Thousand Sunny, are finished beating up Giolla, and head for Green Bit.

The sound of the thunder bolt attracts the attention of Fujitora, who asks Doflamingo if he can see any clouds overhead. When Law realizes that it is probably Nami, he escapes the Admiral's gravity powers using Shambles, switching places with a rock, and successfully retrieving Caesar Clown. The rock he swapped places with is crushed by Fujitora's ability, and Law starts to run with Caesar, while Doflamingo chases them.

Episode 655,A Big Clash! Sanji vs. Doflamingo,3-Aug-14,"Sanji put up a valiant fight but was ultimately defeated by Doflamingo. Before Doflamingo could deliver the killing blow, Sanji was saved by Trafalgar Law who teleported themselves back to the Thousand Sunny. With Caesar Clown back in their control, Law ordered the Straw Hats to head to Zou immediately.
Though the Straw Hats were reluctant in leaving their remaining friends behind, they were forced to agree when they were assaulted by a flying Marine battleship, courtesy of Fujitora, and another one of Doflamingo's hand whips. Law reveals that Doflamingo cannot pursue them in cloudless areas with his Ito Ito no Mi and advises them to find one fast.
Once the Straw Hats escaped with Caesar Clown and the Marines heading to Dressrosa, the two Shichibukai have a showdown on the iron bridge. Law told his former leader that he is ending the alliance with the Straw Hats because once they stop the production of SMILE, Kaido will wipe out Doflamingo. Law also reveals his goal was to make Doflamingo pay for what he did 13 years ago, even if it cost him his life.","Sanji attacks Doflamingo with Diable Jambe and Doflamingo easily dodges while casually asking if the person attacking him is ""Black Leg"" Sanji. Sanji uses Premiere Hachi and Doflamingo dodges again. Doflamingo then uses his Goshikito attack on Sanji and lands a hit. He then turns his sights back on the Thousand Sunny, much to the horror of those watching from it. As Doflamingo is about to go to the ship, Sanji uses Poèle à Frire: Spectre. Doflamingo blocks the attack but admits it is pretty powerful. He then takes control of Sanji. His crew mates panic at seeing him immobilized while Giolla simply laughs and says that all who fight her master while remaining ignorant of his abilities are reduced to, being immobilized and at his mercy. Nami yells at Sanji to run. A whip extends from Doflamingo's hand and he is about to use it on Sanji in a move called Overheat. Nami and Brook ready their weapons in an attempt to do something to help, but Sanji tells them to leave him and run, ordering Nami to use the Coup de Burst to escape.
From the shore, Law sees the events transpiring in the air, and quickly throws a log while using Shambles, having put a Room around himself, Caesar, Doflamingo, and Sanji. Law quickly switches places with the log and then moves everyone out of Doflamingo's path. Doflamingo has no time to halt his attack, and releases Overheat with such power that it reaches all the way to Dressrosa and slices a building in half, surprising and confusing any bystanders. Law, Caesar, and Sanji make a rough landing onto the ship's deck. Caesar is mortified to be back on the ship and orders Giolla to help him, but she cannot, having been placed in the same situation. Doflamingo is heading back to the ship now, unhappy that he let his guard down. Chopper cries out that Doflamingo is coming back again. Law asks Sanji how destroying the factory is going. Sanji tells him they know where it is, but destroying it won't be so easy. Momonosuke asks Sanji where his father and Kanjuro are. Sanji tells him that they are also at the factory and Law realizes they need more time. Caesar sees Law holding a heart and asks if he just took that from the boat. Law tells Caesar that the heart in his hand is his own, and he was hiding Caesars in his own chest cavity.
Law tells the crew to take Caesar and head for Zou right away. Nami is confused and Law explains that he already gave them a Vivre Card that would lead them there. Brook asks what will happen to Luffy and the others if they go now. Law assures them that they will follow the ship as soon as the factory is destroyed. Nami is against this idea, saying they cannot leave without their captain and that they are called the Straw Hat Pirates for a reason. Before the argument can continue, from out of Green Bit comes a Marine battleship, flying over the island. To make matters worse, Doflamingo is now in range to attack on the other side. Law tells them they can stay if they want, but cannot hand Caesar over no matter what. An officer gives the order to fire, which the ship's cannons are, however, something else is descending on the Thousand Sunny, meteors. A frightened Nami tells Law that the ""Spiral Hat"" Pirates are ready to go. Sanji tells Law that he understands him wanting to keep Caesar away, but Dressrosa was supposed to only be a small stepping stone for the overall plan, and tells Law he seems to be a little too fixated on Doflamingo.
Law uses Tact to redirect a meteor into the hull of the battleship. On board the ship, a soldier reports to Admiral Fujitora that the ship had been hit. Issho, while eating a bowl of noodles casually observes that the hit was due to his miscalculation, having not planned for Law to be with them. He gives the order to head back to Dressrosa, noting how the tides have turned. Doflamingo uses Overheat again and makes contact with something on the Thousand Sunny's deck. Law has intercepted the rope and it is now wrapped around Kikoku. Law tells Sanji to find a place without clouds and stay there. Doflamingo ate the Ito Ito no Mi, which allows him to wield strings, which includes casting them through clouds as a means of moving across the sky. Chopper yells for them to go as Law holds his sword at Giolla's neck to keep Doflamingo at bay, even though she told Doflamingo not to worry about her. Coup de Burst is activated and the ship takes off.
On the bridge between Green Bit and Dressrosa, Doflamingo asks Law the point of only letting half the crew escape, saying he could easily use the remaining members as hostages. Law tells him that doing so would only make Doflamingo a part of the many people who would regret underestimating that crew. Law tells Doflamingo that his alliance with the Straw Hats is now over, much to Doflamingo's surprise, as it cuts to a shot of Luffy cheering followed by a shot of those aboard the Thousand Sunny trying to contact the others. Law tells them that the alliance was purely to halt the production of Smile, cutting to shots of Zoro and Kin'emon as well as Robin, Franky, and Usopp. Law tells him that even if he dies here, as long as the factory is destroyed, Doflamingo will still have to face Kaido's wrath. Doflamingo is impressed by Law's plan. Law tells him that as much as he would love to watch the chaos following the factory's destruction, getting revenge for what Doflamingo did thirteen years ago comes first.","Donquixote Doflamingo, Sanji, Brook, Momonosuke, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Giolla, Trafalgar Law, Caesar Clown, Issho, Roronoa Zoro, Kin'emon, Bartolomeo, Gatz, Cavendish, Rebecca, Acilia, Monkey D.

After this, Kanjuro suggested they flee the island, but he was captured in the process, prompting Momonosuke to worry about his safety.
Sanji listens passively as he thinks about Violet.

Tank weeps in happiness once this is revealed as he was a former soldier within the Riku army, even having entered the tournament to keep a watch over Rebecca. Elizabello II is likewise happy to see him and hugs him forcefully, stating that Doldo used to help out his kingdom in time of need. Sai, Boo and Chinjao are less accommodating however, and they confront King Doldo with the knowledge that Doflamingo rose to power due to his actions, which lead his prominence as a black market arms dealer who would supply weapons to the enemies of the Kanokui Kingdom. Sai also states this is the reason why the Happo Navy are in Dressrosa, to find and cripple Doflamingo's weapon supply. Daguma likewise talks ill about Doldo, but Tank steps forth and defends his former king. The pair argue, with Lepanto stating the events concerning Doldo's fall and Doflamingo's rise are uncertain, but Doldo stops him and makes both of them back down. Most of the gladiators also reveal that they are former members of his army. A few of the broken toys unexpectedly arise from the pile and they, along with the former soldiers, bow to Doldo to the shock of everyone present. Hack reports to someone on a Den Den Mushi.
Suddenly, a glob lowers onto Sai and snatches him into the ceiling, and before anyone can react he is dragged through a tunnel into a dark room. An unseen process occurs, including Trebol ordering him to a factory; at the end of which, Sai finds himself turned into a toy monkey without control over his body, compelled to follow Trebol's orders as he marches out of a door into the public.
Back at the Flower Fields, Gancho explains the past of the Tontatta Kingdom. 900 years ago, the dwarves had come to Dressrosa to find resources for their people. The former rulers, the Donquixote Family, had promised to help them, but in truth they enslaved them and forced them to make jewels and trinkets for them alone, away from the public eye. Not even they are certain of the events of that time, as it occurred during the Void Century, but eventually at the end of the 100 years the Riku Family took over as the rulers of Dressrosa. On learning of the plight of Tontatta, the king pleaded for forgiveness and offered to help them. The kingdom flourished during those peaceful years, with the dwarves granted lease to take small items from the humans of the island in the guise of fairies in return for small acts of kindness and the planting of flowers across the kingdom - until Doflamingo, heir of the Donquixotes, came to the island and through treachery overthrew the Riku Family and regained the throne. The tribe is determined not to go back to those dark days and plans to fight with all they have. After being told this, Robin asks Thunder Soldier about Rebecca and why the people hate her. He reveals it was due to the actions of Riku Doldo, who believed he was doing the best he could for the country, but who was misled into doing something terrible. The truth was hidden from the common citizens, who were led to see him as a bad and unfit king and revile him. The soldier tried his best to protect his granddaughter, but ultimately she was caught and thrown in the coliseum. Usopp then asks who he really is, to which the soldier reveals that he is Rebecca's father.","Monkey D.

Episode 659,A Horrible Past! The Secret of Dressrosa,31-Aug-14,"While the fight for block D continues, Thunder Soldier explains to the Straw Hat Pirates how King Riku lost the throne and respect of Dressrosa. Ten years ago Doflamingo appeared in the king's chambers, asking for a 10 billion Belly ransom, in order to leave the country alone. Riku sent his soldiers to ask of the citizens' money, but while they were willingly trying to help their king, Doflamingo controlled Riku and his soldiers with his ability, and made them attack their own people against their will. In the shadows, Doflamingo and his crew are waiting for the right moment to interfere and act as a saving hero in the eyes of Dressrosa's confused citizens.","While Rebecca continues her fight in Block D, the Thunder Soldier explains to Usopp, Franky and Nico Robin, how the former king Riku lost the faith of his people and, eventually, the throne. Dressrosa used to be a fairly poor country but the people were happy and grateful for their king, whose family had managed to keep their land out of war for a whole 800 years.
One night, however, ten years ago, Doflamingo appeared in the king's chambers. Riku recognized him as a descendant of the Donquixote family, and commented on his feats as a pirate, which include stealing money from the Celestial Dragons and blackmailing the World Government to attain the position of Shichibukai. Doflamingo states his demand, asking for a 10 billion Belly fee by dawn, in order to leave the country alone. Riku panics at first, but then decides there is no other way, if he wants to avoid a war, so he gathers his soldiers and asks them to collect all of the citizens' money, without informing them of the situation.
Tank Lepanto, as commander of the army, takes on his king's will and spreads his men across the island, asking for the people to give their fortune, as the king needs it right now. The people are reluctant at first, but seeing their king begging on his knees, via a video Den Den Mushi, they are eventually persuaded. Tank is moved to see everyone giving away their treasures, without even asking for a reason and marks that this shows huge faith.
Just as the money was being gathered, Riku appears in the city of Sevio, riding his horse. The king, with tears in his eyes, starts attacking innocent people and destroying everything in his path, while begging for everyone to stay away from him. Soon, the soldiers follow the king's deeds also unable to control their movement. In the shadows, Doflamingo is seen,along with his crew, using his Devil Fruit ability to control Riku and his soldiers, waiting for the right moment to interfere and act as a saving hero in the eyes of Dressrosa's confused citizens.","Bartolomeo, Monkey D.

Episode 660,A Nightmare! The Tragic Night of Dressrosa,7-Sep-14,"While Doflamingo continues to control Riku Doldo III, his subordinates manage to take control of the castle with the help of an inside spy, who also took princess Viola hostage. With the people's trust in him in tatters, and his spirit broken, King Riku begs for death. Then, Doflamingo appears with his strongest subordinates and defeats the king and his army, setting the grounds for his takeover of the island.
After telling the Straw Hat Pirates of the tragedies of the past, Thunder Soldier explains that the king is still alive since Viola pledged her service to Doflamingo in exchange for the King's life. He, also, explained that although the toys of Dressrosa were once people who despised Doflamingo, they still remember who they were, but not each other and that the drive for revolution is still in them.
In the underground chamber, almost all of the fighters were transformed except for Riku and Chinjao, with the latter having mysteriously forgotten that he had grandchildren.
In the Colosseum, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kin'emon with the help of Bartolomeo, although he was nowhere to be seen.","The citizens of Dressrosa plea for their king to stop attacking his own people, saying the least he could do is spare their lives after they so willingly gave him all their money. The officers at the palace are confused about what to do. One of them states the king looked strange when he left the palace, but never imagined he would do something as awful as that. Another officer deems the problem to no longer be an internal matter and orders that the Marines be called. He is told that Captain Vergo is on his way as Doldo's daughter looks on nervously. She then notices that it is snowing and asks Monet what she is doing, having opened the palace doors without permission. Monet, addressing the woman as Princess Viola, simply laughs and says that if the princess knew how to use her Senrigan properly, she would know that by opening the gates, Monet is welcoming in the new royal family. Guards report a fire in the eastern tower, declaring that pirates have invaded the palace and that Viola has been captured. Monet is then seen holding Viola hostage as several prominent members of the Donquixote Pirates barge through the gates. The guards try to stop them, ordering Monet to let the princess go. Giolla simply jokes that things are about to get busy for them while Lao G more bluntly states that they need to purge the palace.
Meanwhile, king Riku's rampage continues. The king is lamenting the atrocities he is committing, begging someone to kill him. Citizens and guards alike are in tears over the actions being committed. The people wonder why the king is doing this now after always being such a benevolent ruler. The people then begin to curse the Riku name, calling their king human trash. The army is charging through the streets, toward a man on the ground tending to an injured woman. Another man yells for him to run, but the first man only cries out for help. Just before the guards reach him, three large legs appear and kick them away. Someone asks who they are, and Donquixote Doflamingo, sitting atop Diamante, Trebol and Pica, declares that they are there to save the country, and then introduces himself. The people are shocked that pirates of all people would come to their rescue, even though they did defeat the Riku army. Doflamingo secretly is wishing for the people to embrace the violence going on. Doflamingo, after kicking Riku off his horse, orders Trebol, Diamante, and Pica to get rid of the people that are making this country so toxic. The people start cheering for Doflamingo as Thunder Soldier ends the flashback, explaining how Doflamingo took over in just one night.
Usopp comments that the story is something only seen in nightmares. Robin remarks on how truly cunning Doflamingo is while a crying Franky calls his actions unforgivable. Gancho sadly admits that, at the time, the dwarves had believed Riku to be bad as well, saying how ashamed he is to have doubted the king. Usopp then concludes that Riku was probably charged for his war crimes and executed, but Thunder Soldier tells him that in fact the king is still alive. He explains that Doflamingo really liked Viola's ability, which Viola used to her advantage and struck a deal with him. She would follow his orders as long as he did not kill her father. She now serves as a subordinate for Doflamingo, working in his executive staff under the name Violet. The soldier adds that the king is still alive somewhere in the country thanks to her. But one cannot possibly know the suffering she and her father have gone through. He adds that the same is true for the loyal soldiers involved. Robin asks if they were executed and Thunder Soldier replies that some were while others declared their loyalty to Doflamingo then and there, becoming his personal guard. Franky gets angry at the soldiers for their disloyalty. A brief flashback shows Doflamingo exonerating the soldiers, saying that they were under orders from the king, and asks the people if he could take them in as subordinates. Thunder Soldier adds that he also made a difficult decision. He explains that those who were killed and those who defected only make up a small portion of the country's army.
The soldier goes on to say that he, too, should have lost his memories, asking Franky if he remembered what he saw in town, recalling their conversation with the toy Milo. He explains that while toys retain their memories, everyone around them completely forgets their existence. The soldier declares this to be the greatest tragedy of Dressrosa, and is even worse for those who are toys. Robin asks if that means that some toys have forgotten who they are. And the soldier tells her she is correct. He goes on to say that all those who become toys remember their hatred of Doflamingo. Doflamingo might have put those with rebellious ideas in the shadows, but by the same token is also making a powder keg ready to explode. The key to the dwarves' strategy is the number of tragedies caused by Doflamingo. Franky realizes that the plan is to shift the battle in their favor by having every toy rebel and fight with them. Usopp interrupts, reminding them their objective is to destroy the factory, after which they can oust Doflamingo out of the country. Usopp tries to get Robin on his side but she declares Doflamingo's actions unforgivable.
Leo begins to rally the troops, saying that what happened this morning can only be seen as a call to war, adding that it cannot be a coincidence that ""Usoland"" arrived when he did and it is a sign from above to fight now. Upon further inquiry, Usopp learns that the event from this morning to which Leo is referring is Doflamingo's fake resignation. The army saw it as a miracle, only to find out that the newspapers ran a false report, crushing their hopes. That was when they decided to put an end to their oppression this day. Usopp, Robin, and Franky look at them in shock, all apologizing for their actions in their minds.
Changing to the scrap heap under the Colosseum, Riku is talking to Chinjao, saying he heard the pirate retired, yet he still is in charge of his fleet. Chinjao replies he needs someone to inherit the Happo Navy since he doesn't have any grandchildren. Riku comments that no one has it easy these days, while thinking to himself that something felt off about Chinjao's statement, remembering the same feeling ten years ago. While they are talking, Boo, Abdullah and Jeet have all been turned into toys. Outside the building, Luffy is calling while laughing to Zoro and Kin'emon through a window.","Riku Doldo III (flashback), Viola (flashback), Monet (flashback), Buffalo (flashback), Senor Pink (flashback), Machvise (flashback), Gladius (flashback), Baby 5 (flashback), Giolla (flashback), Lao G (flashback), Dellinger (flashback), Sugar (flashback), Donquixote Doflamingo (flashback), Trebol (shadowed, flashback), Pica (shadowed, flashback), Diamante (shadowed, flashback), Rebecca, Thunder Soldier, Usopp, Franky, Nico Robin, Leo, Gancho, Bomba, Cotton, Rampo, Inhel, Tank Lepanto (flashback), Chinjao, Boo (as toys), Abdullah, Jeet (as toy), Monkey D.

Episode 661,A Showdown Between the Warlords - Law vs. Doflamingo,14-Sep-14,"As Luffy talks with Zoro and Kin'emon, Bellamy begins approaching Luffy, saying he finally found him. Bellamy is about to attack Luffy, but begins having second thoughts. Just then, Dellinger interrupts him, claiming he has orders from Doflamingo to dispose of him, since Bellamy is considered a nuisance.
At the iron bridge, Law and Doflamingo continue their fight, with the latter having the upper hand. Diamante calls to inform his captain about Violet's betrayal, which Doflamingo had already figured out. He orders Diamante to send Lao G to guard the entrance of the factory and prevent the Straw Hat Pirates from destroying it, while Diamante handles the crowd's entertainment by himself.
The Marines see through Zoro's disguise and suspect that Lucy is in fact Straw-Hat Luffy. However, they seem to have no memory of the fighters that have been turned into toys.
The Straw Hat Pirates have a meeting via Den Den Mushi and share their knowledge so far. Sanji and his team decide to head back to Dressrosa and Franky asks permission to assist the Riku army's revolution, to which Luffy urges him to go all out.
While Admiral Fujitora arrives at the shores of Dressrosa, there is a big ruckus in the city, with explosions and buildings being cut in half. Doflamingo has Law beaten on the ground, right outside the Colosseum. He then takes out a pistol and shoots Law three times.","As Luffy is talking with Zoro and Kin'emon about everything going on, Bellamy is approaching him from the side, saying he finally found him. Bellamy is about to attack Luffy, claiming it is nothing personal, but he is doing it to become one of the leaders of the Donquixote Family. However, he begins having second thoughts and begins to back out. Dellinger appears behind him revealing that Bellamy is considered an eyesore for the family, and that he intends to kill him. He also admitted, by a slip of the tongue, that the order for Bellamy's disposal came from Doflamingo himself. He then kicks Bellamy and begins to punish him.
At the iron bridge of Dressrosa, Law and Doflamingo are seen clashing. Law manages to scar Doflamingo in the face, but Doflamingo has the upper hand in the fight overall and manages to knock Law down. Diamante calls to inform his captain about Violet's betrayal, to which he replies that he had that already figured out, since he saw Black Leg showing up out of the blue. Doflamingo orders Diamante to send Lao G to the entrance of the Smile Factory and handle the entertainment of the crowd in the Colosseum by himself. Doflamingo has Law's plan figured out. He knows Law wants to stall him there in order to provide time for his allies to destroy the factory, but still wonders why, although he claims to be using them, he has so much faith in Luffy and his crew. Law answers that he believes ""D"" will bring forth another storm.
Luffy meets with Zoro and Kin'emon at the Colosseum and Zoro complains to Luffy for not inviting him to participate at the tournament. Some marine sees through Zoro's disguise and informs Vice Admiral Bastille, who figures out that Lucy is none other than Straw Hat Luffy, but still decides to do nothing for the time being, not wanting to compromise his mission to arrest all the fighters of the tournament. Going through the list of fighters they are supposed to arrest, however, the Marines find it odd that they only recognize Don Chinjao's name.
Kin'emon calls Sanji via Den Den Mushi, who in turn calls Usopp, so that all the Straw Hat Pirates can have a meeting and discuss their stories so far. Franky informs his crew mates that an anti-Donquixote army exists, the Riku army, consisting of dwarves and led by Thunder Soldier (whom he and Luffy met earlier at the Colosseum), who intend to act fast and overthrow Doflamingo today. Luffy realizes the soldier is the same Rebecca was talking about and, fearing for his life, asks Franky to prevent the army from acting. However, Franky states that he sympathizes with the Dwarves and wants to help them defeat their oppressor and reveal the darkness under Dressrosa's bliss, despite that going against their original plan. Hearing their crew mate's plea, Sanji orders his group to turn back and head for Dressrosa, and Luffy allows Franky to go all out, saying that they soon will come to join them.
Fujitora and his subordinates have arrived at the shores of Dressrosa on their ship. A marine informs the Admiral that there is a skirmish in the city, to which Issho states that they must hurry. In the city, Kin'emon and Zoro witness huge buildings being cut in half and wonder what this is all about. Suddenly, a huge explosion takes place right in front of them. When the smoke clears, they see Doflamingo standing and on the ground a badly beaten and bleeding Law. Doflamingo, wearing a serious face mocks Law for thinking he was a match for him. He then takes out a pistol and shoots Law three times, to everyone's surprise. Luffy calls his ally's name in desperation. Law is thinking of someone named Cora while slowly losing consciousness.","Monkey D.

Episode 662,Two Great Rivals Meet Each Other! Straw Hat and Heavenly Yaksha,21-Sep-14,"Doflamingo lies to the shocked citizens that witnessed him shooting Law, telling them that Law was actually responsible for the morning's fake news about Doflamingo leaving the throne. When asked by Luffy what he is doing to Law, Doflamingo responds that Law was originally his subordinate and as such, it is his responsibility to ""educate"" him.
Zoro and Kin'emon attempt to save Law, but before the Marines make a move to stop them, Admiral Fujitora appears, blocking Zoro's sword and sends him underground, using his Devil Fruit ability. Luffy attempts to help, but is blocked by the Colosseum's bars, which are made of Seastone. The rest of the crew, who are listening to the events, are shocked to learn that Doflamingo has an admiral on his side. Fujitora and Doflamingo pick up Law and head for the palace, in order to finish their conversation. Zoro tells Luffy to find a way out, as they try to outrun the Marines.
At that point, Sanji's group is attacked by what appears to be a singing ship, which belongs to the Emperor Big Mom. On the ship are Tamago and Pekoms, who reveal that their goal is Caesar Clown.
The Straw Hat Pirates realize they have to keep their new enemies away from Dressrosa if they want to destroy the factory. Luffy gives the order for the Sunny to head to Zou, Sanji asks permission to return fire to the Emperor's ship and Franky leads the way for the factory destruction team. Finally, Luffy states in anger that they will head to the palace to save Law and defeat Doflamingo.
Meanwhile, a mysterious figure appears in the Colosseum.","As the Straw Hat Pirates yells out across the Den Den Mushi, questioning what the commotion is about, Doflamingo soothes the citizens, blaming Law for the ""Abdication Incident"" that occurred earlier that day. When Luffy angrily demands to know what the Shichibukai has done, Doflamingo states that it is none of his business and that, since Law was his former subordinate, he is entitled to ""discipline"" him.
Zoro then quickly charges at Doflamingo, asking Kin'emon to take Law out of danger. The marines ask Vice-Admiral Bastille permission to apprehend the pirate hunter, but he orders them to stay put. The samurai quickly informs everyone across the line of what has happened while agreeing with Zoro that they both should be on their toes. Doflamingo recognizes Kin'emon and assumes that the boy he saw on the ship was his son, Momonosuke.
As Zoro tries to land a swing on Doflamingo, Admiral Fujitora appears out of nowhere and blocks his attack. Using his ability the Admiral pins Zoro down, however the swordsman responds sending a flying slash, which gets repelled rather effortlessly. At the same time, Kin'emon manages to reach Law, but before the samurai could recover him, Doflamingo kicks him back. Luffy tries to help his friends, but only then realizes that the bars in the windows of the Colosseum are made of Seastone. The entire crew is then shocked to find out that the man assisting Doflamingo is actually a Marine Admiral.
Doflamingo and Issho float above their opponents using their abilities, taking Law with them, and plan to head towards the palace. The Shichibukai promises to explain everything to the Admiral, who replies that he will reserve judgment until their conversation is complete. Zoro and Kin'emon realize the Marines have seen through their disguise and decide to make a run for it. Luffy claims he can still hear Law's voice and Zoro tells him to hurry up and find a way out, while they distract their pursuers.
It is then, that they hear the crew members aboard the Thousand Sunny panicking over the Den Den Mushi. Their ship is being approached by, what seems to be, a huge talking ship, which belongs to the Big Mom Pirates, although Sanji can not tell if the Emperor herself is on board. Pekoms and Tamago confirm that Caesar Clown is on the Sunny and state their intention to sink the ship and retrieve the scientist. Caesar explains that he once stole research funds from Big Mom in the past, and that is probably why he is now being targeted. As the ship opens fire, Franky asks the Sunny team to lead the Emperor away from Dressrosa so that their mission does not get compromised.
Nami explains that they need to head to Zo, for three reasons: firstly to keep Momonosuke and Caesar away from Doflamingo; secondly because if they lead the Emperor's crew towards Dressrosa, the chaos will ruin the revolution; and lastly, to ensure that Law's sacrifice is not in vain, and to allow Franky, Robin and Usopp to carry out the plan and destroy the SMILE factory.
Luffy approves of the plan to head to Zo and gives Sanji permission to fire back at Big Mom's ship. Franky's group prepares to head towards the SMILE factory, while Luffy plans to head to the palace with Zoro and Kin'emon in order to defeat Doflamingo and recover their ally.

As Luffy is looking for the colosseum's exit, he runs into Bartolomeo and Bellamy, and are shortly approached by Sabo. Promising to retrieve the Mera Mera no Mi, Luffy gives Sabo his disguise so the latter may fight in the Colosseum. Bellamy leads Luffy to an exit as Luffy, Kin'emon, and Zoro head to the Flower Field in disguises.","Dellinger is seen brutally harming Bellamy as he mocks him. Bellamy attempts to run stating he needs to hear this from Doflamingo but Dellinger easily catches him. Just as Dellinger is about to give the finishing blow, Bartolomeo shows up and protects him.
Bellamy is seen panting and hurt badly on the ground, with Bartolomeo having formed a barrier to protect him from Dellinger. Dellinger injures his leg trying to break through the barrier and shouts to Bartolomeo to get out of the way and let him finish his mission, but Bartolomeo refuses. Having been given a new mission by Diamante to go and guard the SMILE factory, Dellinger decides to leave Bellamy be but promises to deal with both of them later. Bellamy wonders why a stranger like Bartolomeo was helping him, to which Bartolomeo replies that once he fights along with someone, he considers him a friend.
Back at the Flower Hill, Thunder Soldier is briefing everyone about his plan, called Dressrosa Operation SOP. He goes on to explain the existence of a secret underground world operating in Dressrosa, which involves illegal transactions. The factory, which is also tied to the underworld, function with the labor of the captured Tontatta citizens and the people turned to toys. The resistance has been building a secret tunnel, which they will now use to enter the area and destroy the factory. Before that, however, they must succeed in defeating an agent of Doflamingo, in order to make her power lose effect thus returning the toys into their human selves and restoring the citizens' memories. Hopefully, by achieving that, more people would join their cause. When asked by Usopp where that Devil Fruit user is, Thunder Soldier answers she must be at the underground port and, due to her Devil fruit's side effect, which has kept her from aging, she is guarded by Trebol himself. Usopp rejoices, when he hears he is up against a little girl and a pumped up Franky asks the Dwarves to take them to the underground tunnel.
Back at the Colosseum, Luffy, who was looking for an exit, bumps into Bartolomeo and Bellamy. Bartolomeo, excited to meet his idol again, asks him reluctantly if he met with Zoro. When Luffy states his desire to find an exit, Bellamy tells him that such a thing does not exist in the Colosseum, because it was built in a way to prevent the contestants from escaping once they enter. Luffy, surprised, asks Bellamy to show him the exit, since he must know where it is, being Doflamingo's subordinate. Bellamy shouts he would never betray his captain, but says that he will be heading for the exit himself, so if Luffy was to follow him he could find the exit, too. Bartolomeo wonders why Luffy would give up the fight for the Mera Mera no Mi, to which Luffy replies that his friends' lives are more important. Bartolomeo promises to get the fruit and give it to Luffy, which was his original plan anyway.
At that point, a man walks in stating that the fire fruit cannot go to Straw Hat Luffy. Bartolomeo confronts him for speaking to his idol like that, but the man simply pushes him away. Upon looking at the mysterious man, Luffy is greatly shocked and starts shedding tears of joy.
When Luffy finaly finds his way out, he meets with Zoro and Kin'emon again, with the latter providing animal outfits for the three of them, in order to escape the Marines and leave the area unnoticed. Zoro is irritated by Luffy's non-stop crying and tells him to cut it out. Luffy, still sobbing and shocked, wonders how is it possible for ""that man"" to be still alive.
A young woman is seen sitting on top of a bunch of defeated men, speaking through a Den Den Mushi, stating that Robin is in this country and that she desires to see her again. The woman is none other than Koala, who has become a member of the Revolutionary Army and is a Fish-Man Karate assistant instructor. She goes on to ask the receiver of the call, if he met the man he was looking for and if he had any news on the situation underground. Then the man is shown, who is the same man seen talking to Luffy earlier, wearing ""Lucy""'s attire, stating that he has to go get Ace's fruit back and inherit his will.
A flashback of Ace's grave is then shown, with three cups in front of it, confirming that the mysterious man was none other than Sabo, who was presumed to be long dead by his brothers.","Bellamy, Dellinger, Donquixote Doflamingo (flashback), Bartolomeo, Diamante, Nico Robin, Franky, Usopp, Thunder Soldier, Gancho, Bomba, Rampo, Inhel, Cotton, Flapper, Issho (image), Nubon, Leo, Sugar (imagination), Trebol (image), Monkey D.

Leo apologizes mentioning large humans weren't meant for the passage. Franky asks how he can find another way in and the soldier reveals he can go through the Toy House above ground, but is against that idea. He reveals it's only called a house because of its appearance, but there are no beds inside and all the toys continue to work even in night. Usopp then asks if that means that all the toys over Dressrosa are tired even now from working all day and night and the soldier says its true with the exeption of himself. Franky decides to go through the house alone stating if he causes a commotion up there then they can take out Sugar much easier.
Franky arrives at the toy house as the lower members recognize him as ""Cyborg Franky"". They then report to Senor Pink. Pink is seen eating a tomato while a woman tells him not to eat it since it will get messy. But he ignores her and rips her swimsuit off to use it as a napkin. However, the women are swooned by him while he tells him they should go after younger men despite their claim. When he says he doesn't like children, they swoon again calling him ""hard-boiled"".

Episode 666,Winner Decided!? A Surprising Result of Block D,19-Oct-14,"The last standing fighter is revealed to be Rebecca, making her the winner, much to the dissatisfaction of the disbelieving audience. Rebecca was the only one to saw what really happened during the fight. Cavendish fell asleep in the midst of the fighting, but before the other fighters could take advantage, Cavendish woke up with a sinister face, and moved as fast as the wind, cutting down every fighter. Rebecca dodged a fatal strike from Cavendish, who then fell asleep again. Outside the Colosseum, Vice Admiral Bastille explains that Cavendish's actions is, in fact, the actions of his alter ego Hakuba, who is notorious for his speed. At the palace, Doflamingo boasts to King Riku that Luffy is trapped in the Colosseum, and his men will stop the Straw Hat Pirates. Unbeknownst to Doflamingo, Robin and Usopp infiltrate the basement harbor, and elsewhere, Luffy's group runs into Viola who wants to help them break into the palace.","In the D block battle, after 20 contestants are knocked out, Gatz sees that someone is attempting to stand in the middle of the block, and that person is Rebecca. As it is announced that Rebecca is the block winner, the crowd begins booing her claiming that she must have cheated. Meanwhile, at the prisoner gladiator quarters, Rebecca's friends cheer for her victory.
Outside the Colosseum, Vice Admiral Bastille tells a marine about the Kamaitachi of Rommel. He says that sometime ago in the kingdom of Rommel a strange wind was blowing during the night, that had the power to cut people up. After a series of mysterious events, the Marines decided to send a battle ship to investigate the matter. Many Marines lost their lives to that ""wind"" but they finally managed to find out that the culprit behind the wind was actually a man named Hakuba. Despite not being able to capture him, they deduced that Hakuba appears in the towns where a certain pirate stops.
In the Colosseum, Rebecca sees Cavendish unconscious before her and she remembers that as she was fighting Suleiman in the battle, suddenly Cavendish fell asleep. The other gladiators noticed this and took the opportunity to take him out. As they were about to attack him, Cavendish woke up with a sinister expression and slashed all the other gladiators so fast, that they didn't even see him coming. However, Rebecca was able to see through his movements and barely managed to avoid his strike, which hit her helmet instead. Cavendish then fell asleep again returning to his normal form.
Back outside the Colosseum, Bastille continues with his explanation about Hakuba, telling the soldiers that Cavendish turns into Hakuba when he falls asleep and that Hakuba was the one who went out to sea after committing various crimes. The other Marines start sympathizing with Cavendish, but Bastille corrects them saying that Cavendish actually enjoys the popularity his alter ego offers him. Finally, Bastille notes that while Cavendish is a strong swordsman, Hakuba is even better than him in terms of strength and speed and it's just unfortunate for him that Cavendish's ability doesn't work well in a match-style fight.
In the Colosseum the crowd accuses Rebecca of secretly carrying a gun. Lucy who was watching this, next to Bartolomeo, says that it probably wasn't just luck that allowed Rebecca to avoid those attacks, but anyways he wouldn't let anyone touch the Mera Mera no Mi.
In the palace, Doflamingo and the captured Riku Doldo III are observing the outcome of the battles. Doflamingo is certain that Luffy won't make it out of the Colosseum and that Franky, who is causing a ruckus at the moment, will be defeated by his associates.

Sabo who is dressed as Lucy says that he more or less knows about Rebecca and that things could get messy in the finals and he cannot guarantee her safety. He also mentions that he does not mean any harm and that everything in Dressrosa is just a facade similar to the place where he was brought up.
At the Royal Plateau near the entrance to the lift, Viola, who just met Luffy , Zoro and Kin'emon, states that she has a pass that will allow them to board the lift leading to the Royal Palace, but if they get discovered it will all be over and in their disguises, Luffy, Zoro, and Kin'emon will draw too much attention.

Franky fires a missile and Senor takes it right on the face without making any attempt to dodge it. Everyone wonders why didn't he try to avoid the hit, but one of his soldiers says that the real reason he took Franky's attack was to save his comrade. Then from behind him Machvise, who is complaining about his stomach hurting, jumps in the air and smashes on the ground in at attempt to crush Franky, but Franky dodges him. Suddenly, a group of Marines along with Vice-Admiral Bastille appear surrounding the area intending to arrest Franky.
At the Royal Palace, Doflamingo tells Admiral Fujitora that he made a wise choice and that he does not intend on forming an alliance with him. Fujitora replies that if Luffy decides to fight him there will be a lot of destruction and protecting the citizens from that destruction is his ""Justice"" and that is what he has utilized the Marines for. As for Doflamingo he will deal with him later. Doflamingo is surprised by this statement but, Fujitora continues and says that he accepted the position of Admiral because there were certain things that he wanted to change and one of those things is the total discarding of the Shichibukai system! He also reveals that he knows about the story of Doflamingo hijacking Dressrosa and it is only because he was allowed to run rampant that the country reached such a state.
Upon realizing that Fujitora knows all about his secrets, Doflamingo begins to attack him. Fujitora blocks his attack and continues saying that the balance of the Three Great Powers will be shattered and if Doflamingo keeps on committing crime after crime, the bounty on his head will keep on increasing after the Shichibukai system is abolished. After finding out his true intentions Doflamingo says that he is going to kill him but Fujitora says that they should continue being friends for the time being. From that point onwards he would protect Dressrosa and ignore all its malpractices. He also says that no matter how much Doflamingo wants the world to be stable it is bound to stir up because it is the year of the Levely.
Luffy is surprised to learn that Viola is a princess and assumes that since she's is a princess and Rebbecca is the granddaughter of the King so she must be Rebecca's mother but she tells him that Rebecca is her sister's daughter and therefore her niece. She then knocks open a door leading to a secret passage whose location was known only to the Riku Family. In order to use the lift, Zoro suggests Luffy would take a boulder and go to the top and then the others would stand on the platform and due to his and the boulder's weight they would reach the top. However, Viola does not seen to be comfortable with this plan.

However, the group is interrupted as three gladiators rush at Rebecca, saying that they refuse to be beaten by her and that they cannot accept such an outcome. Diamante steps in, telling the gladiators that ""results are results"" and holds his cape in front of his body. The gladiators rush at him but only injure themselves and break their swords. Diamante announces that this is a result of his Devil Fruit, the Hira Hira no Mi. He reveals that his cape is actually made of steel, only fluttering like a cape due to his powers. Consequently, he 'flutters' his sword into a bull shape and defeats the gladiators easily.
Diamante also informs them that the new fighting fish are ""befitting"" for such an occasion and are sensitive to the smell of blood. Indeed, a fighting fish charges onto the bridge section and takes the gladiators with it. Gatz informs the audience that these reach contestants inside the ring and are more deadly as they are the ""boss class fighting fish of each school"". He also reveals that one fish carries a chest with the Mera Mera no Mi inside.

Meanwhile, at the Underground Factory, Usopp notes that toys just keep coming out of the Factory proving that Sugar is in the Factory. He then asks the Dwarves what the tentacle-like things that are connected to the tower are. They explain to him that the one in the center is a lift that leads to the palace while the pipe-like things are tubes that reach the Scrap Heap. It takes people and broken toys from various places and drops them into the Scrap Heap which is below the Officer Tower.

Usopp, Robin, and their group of dwarves reach the room where Trebol and Sugar are located. The dwarves state that Sugar loves eating grapes. So their plan is to put a solid ball of the world's hottest spice, Tatabababasco, which they've made to look like a grape, into her basket of grapes. The seasoning is so spicy that when it was tested 50 times on the dwarves all of them fainted and 18 of them were on the verge of dying. Usopp tells Leo to go ahead and execute the plan and he will stay back and cover him although in his mind he intends to run away if the plan fails. Leo steps up to place the ball of Tatababasco into the basket as the other dwarves cheer him on. He says that when Sugar cries out, it will be the sign that all the toys will become human again and all their forgotten memories will return and the evil deeds of Doflamingo be brought to light and his true colors will be revealed to everyone!

Inside the SMILE Factory, an overseer is forcing the dwarves to work in the SMILE fields. He remarks that even though five hundred dwarves were kidnapped, their comrades still did not notice anything due to their naïveté; and since he is not going to get any more slaves, he will work the current ones to his heart's content. The man complains that they are too slow and whips them. As he inspects the fruits they have collected in a wagon, he notices that they have not even become SMILEs yet. He kicks the wagon, knocking the fruits to the ground, and berates the dwarves. Although the dwarves are good with growing fruit, they complain that SMILE is an unusual fruit, but he is unconvinced and says they are just making excuses. One of the dwarves begs him to let his companion rest, and that the food they were given was rotten. The overseer lies and tells them that the only medicine that can heal their princess is SMILE, and that only one out of every ten SMILES can be used. They ask if they can be allowed to see the princess, but the man pretends to cry, saying that the ""rare disease"" might be infectious. The dwarves believe him, and, moved by his affection, and say that they will try their best to grow SMILEs.
Outside the executive tower, Leo is angry at Robin for stopping him, but she explains that if he were to just run in, he would have died. The fly that Trébol shot was hit clean between the eyes, meaning he could easily have attacked Leo. It is still too dangerous to target Sugar while she is being guarded by him.
Bian creates a distraction at the port with some pink hornets, and Robin reports the disturbance to Trébol, saying that some pirates are demanding to speak with an executive about their payment. Hearing this, Trébol wonders that they do not fear Joker. He notices that Robin is not the usual person reporting, but she simply lies, saying that the other person has gone to eat. She also says that some people have been wounded. Trébol leaves to take care of the situation, but posts extra guards with orders to notify him if anything happens.
As they reach the executive tower, the dwarves ask Usopp why he will not fight Sugar. He bluffs that if he were to fight, the battle would be over instantly. He also says that this will help them gain confidence, but if anything happens he will be there to help them defeat Sugar.
Entering the tower, the dwarves quickly surround Sugar. They tell her that they will take back their companions enslaved in the factory, and that they will make her pay. She replies that she does not know what they are talking about, and the dwarves believe her without wondering about it. Usopp tells them she was fooling them, and Sugar wonders who told them, as they are too naïve to realize it by themselves. She drops her basket of grapes, saying that she didn't expect them to do anything for at least a year, and that somebody must have encouraged this, The dwarves charge at her, with the aim of holding her down and opening her mouth to feed her the tobasco ball. Sugar is upset somewhat that the dwarves seem to think she's weak, just because she's a young girl. Some of the dwarves charge in, but she turns them into toy bears. She makes a contract with them, forcing them to obey her orders. Usopp, watching this, is shocked, but the rest of the dwarves lose all memory of the dwarves who were turned into toys, and it appears to them that a group of toys suddenly appeared before them. Sugar gives the toys orders to slaughter everyone in the tower. The toy dwarves do not want to fight their companions but cannot disobey the orders given by Sugar due to their contract. The dwarves charge at the toys, who try to tell them that they are their allies but are unable to.
Sugar calls Trébol on a Den Den Mushi, telling him return immediately, and that it is a trap. As he turns back, Robin points out that the pirates that were creating trouble are right before them. Trébol leaps at them, preparing to stop the fight, but they tell him that the disruption was due to hornets in the cargo, and they were holding up their end of the bargain. He turns around to see Robin running, and realizes that he has been tricked. He leaps again, catching her in his slime, but it is a decoy clone.

Usopp is baffled at the dwarves putting all their faith in a simple toy soldier, but Leo reveals that Thunder Soldier was the first to be turned into a toy and as such, was not given a contract, which is why he leads the resistance, and his human identity was of the legendary gladiator, Kyros.","The dwarves, Usopp, and Sugar are all shocked as a giant ship crashes into the room. Even the toy workers stop to look at the incident in astonishment. Trebol's subordinates cry out that he has lost it, and comment on how the tower is now in ruins.
Meanwhile Zoro is continuing his fight with Pica while Luffy and Viola run off fending off Pica's stone strikes.
Robin finds Usopp, who is apparently pretending to be knocked out, and wakes him up. He says that a ""duck came flying through the roof,"" and Robin tells him to keep quiet, and that Leo's group has been captured.
Sure enough, the dwarves are being interrogated by Trebol and Sugar (who angrily kicks him for throwing the ship). They claim that they will never reveal their partners' names, though Trebol lies that Usopp is his dear friend, prompting Leo to give away the name. As he mocks that Usopp isn't his friend Leo screams in horror that he fell for another trick. A similar situation follows with Sugar asking about Thunder Soldier.
Trebol notes that the dwarves have quite a plan in action, to which they respond that it doesn't matter since the Donquixote Pirates are already done for. The officer simply drops some of the sticky substance onto them, which is flammable. After throwing his lighter into the substance it explodes. Usopp finds Leo seriously injured and advises that he and the dwarves get out of the harbor. Leo laments that he can't beat Trebol, but says that Operation SOP must be completed, because if so then Thunder Soldier can crush Doflamingo. He says that the ""captain is waiting for them"".
The scene changes to the fight between Lao G and Thunder Soldier, with the former almost finished defeating the latter. Knocked down, Thunder Soldier recalls the events that morning. The prisoner gladiators and the dwarves cheer as the newspaper claims Doflamingo has quit the Shichibukai, but Thunder Soldier only sadly says that it is not true.
Then he tries to console Rebecca, who is upset about the entire thing and cries about being ""cast down from the heavens to hell"". She says that everyone's spirits are breaking, even remembering someone saying that the only thing to look forward to is execution, and angrily cries that achieving a thousand wins in the colosseum to be freed is not hope but rather a wall of despair. She even remarks that the statue of Kyros is nothing but a lie made by the prisoners as a preservation of hope, and if she has to dream the impossible, she would rather put all her hopes into the competition for the Mera Mera no Mi. Thunder Soldier scolds her that she is only 16, and that she is too young and weak to take on the competition. Rebecca tears up and says that he is not her real father, that he is the one who is going to get beaten up, and that he is nothing but a toy soldier. He simply agrees, and walks away; Rebecca quickly apologizes and pleads him not to start the operation.
Back in the present, Rebecca, who has not yet gone to the offensive side, seemingly angrily attacks Diamante. He notices that the sword is blunt; he mocks that the battle is one of life and death, and simply smashes her with a club he made with a folded sheet of iron. The crowd cheers the Hero of the colosseum, while Lucy orders ""Muscle Melon"" to protect Rebecca, to which he barks that his name is Bartolomeo. Meanwhile Diamante laughs and sarcastically asks if he knew how her mother, Scarlett, died. He says that he even got a little emotional seeing Thunder Soldier cry so hard. Rebecca remembers her mother saying that she will be back with some food, but came back dead and carried by the toy soldier.
Back at the palace Lao G gets distracted by the tremors Pica is causing, and soon ambushed by Kabu's group. The dwarves tell Thunder Soldier to go ahead, though he worries about their safety and notes that they will all die. Kabu reassures the captain by saying that Leo is almost done with their part, and that all he needs to do is shoot Doflamingo.
Underground Usopp asks Leo why they are so reliant on the toy. Leo explains that while the other toys where all assigned contracts to obey Doflamingo, Thunder Soldier was the only exception. And because he was left with a free will, he is the only one capable of fighting against Doflamingo. In fact if it weren't for him the dwarves would have all become slaves as well, due to their naïvety. He ends with a speech in which Thunder Soldier reveals himself to be Kyros, the strongest gladiator in the Colosseum.","Leo, Flapper (as toy), Bobomba, Chicory, Trebol, Sugar, Usopp, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

In the trading port, Leo and his dwarves try once again to poison Sugar, but Trebol stops them, and Sugar has her toys attack them further. Robin subdues the two so Leo can poison Sugar, but Sugar turns Robin into a toy by touching the latter's arm.","At the royal palace's first floor, after fighting through several of Doflamingo's men, Rampo, Kabu, and Thunder Soldier were intercepted by Gladius. The two dwarves attempted to attack him in order for the Thunder Soldier escape, but the officer effortlessly caught them. Gladius then attacked them with his Devil Fruit powers, knocking them out with the explosions by rupture of his arms. He then went after Thunder Soldier, stating he can't outrun him as a toy. He tackled the toy soldier from behind and, while explaining his ability, inflated the soldier's head. Right before it exploded, Luffy knocked Gladius away with a Jet Stamp, saving Thunder Soldier from certain demise. Luffy was about to continue the fight with the officer, but Viola pulled him away, stating that Gladius was too dangerous. Upon seeing Viola, Gladius ranted about her betrayal and exploded his helmet, hurting her with the helmet's shards, managing to wound Viola which forced Luffy to carry her. Seeing no stairs to advance further up, Viola, Luffy, and Thunder Soldier jumped out a window and Luffy used his leg to stretch to the second floor conveniently outside the Room of Suits. As they overheard Doflamingo trying to get Law to tell him what the Straw Hats' plan was, Luffy asked if he can attack Doflamingo, only to be denied and told to wait by Viola, while Thunder Soldier places his faith in Usopp to gon with the plan.
After losing sight of them, Gladius ran into Kin'emon, disguised as the Doflamingo with Wicca hiding in his pocket. Fooled by the disguise, Gladius informed him that Kanjuro had disappeared from the scrap house.
At the underground trade port, Robin used her Devil Fruit powers in an attempt to knock out Sugar with the spice the dwarves were going to use. Unfortunately, she let her guard down for a moment and Sugar touched one of her arms, transforming her into a toy.

Leo and his comrades keep trying to tell Trebol that Usoland will save them, their speech transmitted across the port via Den Den Mushi. Trebol merely mocks the dwarves and begins stomping them, but eventually, Usopp returns and yells at the dwarves. He tells them he's no hero and he really was lying, for he's the sniper of the Straw Hats, Usopp. He finally decides to fight for them as he launches a Shuriken Star that cuts Trebol to pieces.","At the underground trade port, Robin used her Devil Fruit powers in an attempt to knock out Sugar with the spice the dwarves were going to use. Unfortunately, she let her guard down for a moment and Sugar touched one of her arms, transforming her into a toy. While wandering in the trade port, Robin wondered where Usopp went and put her hopes in him as well.
At the toy house, Franky decided to remain at the toy house to battle the Marines, because going to the underground world with them after him would jeopardize Thunder Soldier's plans. He also placed his faith in Usopp.
With all the dwarves incapacitated, Leo also put his faith in Usopp. However, Usopp decided to run from the scene and angrily asked himself why Franky wasn't coming.
As Usopp runs off in fear, Trebol tells the toys to get back to work, but they are shaken by the dwarves' rebellion. The barely conscious dwarves then call on Usopp, still hoping that he will save them. Usopp hears their call and freezes up as Trebol and Sugar question Leo about this ""Usoland"". Leo tells the two that Usopp is a legendary hero that gave his word to save all the dwarves and toys, and will do so. Trebol laughs at the dwarves' naivety, telling them that ""Usoland"" abandoned them. The dwarves are shocked, but Leo refuses to believe that Usopp would abandon them, trusting in their ""hero's"" word to the end. Trebol then steps on Leo, angering the dwarves even more. Suddenly, Usopp appears, telling the dwarves to quit the charade about him.
As the toy Robin and the dwarves see Usopp, the pirate confesses the truth: he is not Usoland, the heroic descendant of Montblanc Noland, but Usopp, one of the Straw Hat Pirates. The dwarves struggle to believe this revelation and begin to weep, but then Usopp tells Trebol that he is still gonna save the dwarves. Before, he had realized that he wouldn't have been able to rest knowing that the dwarves had always been counting on him, and that it would be good to die if it was a noble death. He then declares that he is Usopp, the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and that they should put their faith in him, as he has decided to become the legendary hero of the Tontatta. With the rest of the toys wondering if he has come to save them, he launches a new pop green at Trebol; Hissatsu Midori Boshi: Platanus Shuriken, telling Trebol that it is time to sink or swim as the attack cuts him in half.","Trebol, Sugar, Leo, Nico Robin (as toy), Franky, Dellinger, Bastille, Machvise, Senor Pink, Viola, Monkey D.

Episode 675,A Fateful Encounter — Kyros and King Riku,21-Dec-14,"While Usopp faces Trebol, the Thunder Soldier recalls his time as Kyros. After much time as a gladiator, Kyros manages to become King Riku's captain of his guard and later marries his eldest daughter Scarlett and they together conceive Rebecca. As they have a happy life together as a family, Doflamingo ruins it as he attempts to take over Dressrosa that night 10 years ago.","Usopp's attack on Trebol is revealed to have done nothing, as the latter easily puts himself back together and toys with Usopp.
Meanwhile, Thunder Soldier flashes back to his life before he was turned into a toy. At the age of 15, Kyros was arrested for the murder of two people. King Riku showed him mercy and allowed him his freedom after fighting 100 battles in the colosseum, to which Kyros agrees to. Within four months, he was able to win his freedom. However, Kyros continues to fight in the arena after realizing that there was no other place for him since the people still reviled him as a murderer. After 1000 victories, Riku asked why Kyros wanted to battle so much. Kyros sadly replies that all people will remember him as is a murderer. He also wishes that people would just forget about him and his past. Ironically, this wish would be fulfilled years later. Later on, it is revealed that he began to have nightmares over the blood he shed as a murderer with King Riku silently observing him.
Kyros stays for 9 years in the arena, winning battle after battle without any injury and winning the people's admiration over time. King Riku under the pretense of Ricky, competes against Kyros and his 3,000 wins and loses after giving him a single injury on the head when Kyros is shocked upon recognizing him. Kyros realized that it was the king who was fighting him all along and wondered why did it. The King told Kyros that even though Kyros taught him how to fight with a sword, he doesn't want him to spend his entire life fighting in the colosseum and convinced him to join the army as the captain of the guard. However, Scarlett (the princess of Dressrosa) is distrustful of him since his past as a murderer is well known to her and told him that he will never come near nor touch her or her sister, even though she is under his protection. This changes when pirates kidnap her and Kyros saves her. As a result, Scarlett falls in love with him and begins to spend more time together (much to Kyros's chagrin). Eventually, he reciprocates her feeling and they end up marrying.
Due to Kyros' past as a murderer, Scarlett convinces her father to fake her death so she can live happily with Kyros. She eventually bears him a child who she named Rebecca. The family spend their days living in the flower field where Riku comes to visit them regularly. Kyros himself couldn't bear to touch his daughter since he believes she is too pure to be touched by a murderer and wear gloves routinely when he does play with her. Despite this quirk, they continued to live a life filled with more happiness than Kyros had hoped for. However, one day, Kyros and his family notices the palace burning and questions what is happening.","Trebol, Usopp, Leo, Cotton, Bian, Bomba, Sugar, Nico Robin (as toy), Trafalgar Law, Baby 5, King Riku Doldo III, Buffalo, Donquixote Doflamingo, Thunder Soldier/Kyros, Viola, Monkey D.

Trebol quickly tells Doflamingo via Den Den Mushi about what has happened, telling him that the effects of the Hobi Hobi no Mi were nullified, with Doflamingo showing massive concern and asking him if he was joking. The people in the streets panic due to the unexpected transformations happening all at once. Some citizens embrace their lost family members, but others run in fear from the wild animals and pirates who had just changed back from becoming toys, and some of the other toys that were turned back were revealed to be former Dressrosa soldiers, government officials, marines, beasts and leaders of other nations. Upon hearing reports of the panic, Fujitora and Bastille prepare to restore order while the wounded Franky gives a weak laugh as Senor Pink who is accompanied by Dellinger and Machvise chastises Sugar for being defeated so easily and wasting 10 years of planning, but takes back his statement by hoping that she has been not severely injured.

The dwarves celebrate Usopp making Operation SOP a success, weeping in gratitude and promising to build a statue of him, proclaiming him a hero. The barely conscious Usopp boldly proclaims that everything went ""according to plan"" and is confident that his crew can deal with the rest, knowing that the real fight has only just begun. Doflamingo, meanwhile, is severely frustrated and knee-deep in worry as he receives numerous calls via Den Den Mushi from all corners of Dressrosa.
With Doflamingo panicking at the turn of events, many Dressrosa citizens begin to revolt against their king and begin attacking, along with various other pirates attacking the grunts of the crew while informing the other citizens of Doflamingo's true nature. In the port all the colosseum combatants begin taking their revenge and attack the Donquixote members. Doflamingo in turn, looks out to the island from a window, utterly furious that his 10 years worth of planning and work has been undone just like that.
Meanwhile, the Thunder Soldier turns back into Kyros, which causes Rebecca, Viola and Riku to remember, while the former king begins to cry finally remembering his former friend and army commander. As Luffy and Viola stare at the man before them, Kyros vanishes from Luffy and Viola's side and rushes toward the palace suits room, with Luffy questioning who he is to Viola who suddenly bursts into tears after finally remembering who he is due to the Hobi Hobi no Mi curse being lifted. She answers him by explaining the power of the Hobi Hobi no Mi and how everyone's memories were regained after Sugar was defeated and proclaims him to be the ex-commander of Riku's army and champion of the Colosseum, Kyros.

Meanwhile, in the Colosseum, Gatz expresses shock at the sight of the toys in the audience turning into humans and animals as a large gorilla scares away several citizens. Watching the dispersing crowds, Diamante notes Trebol must have left Sugar unguarded for this to occur. Bartolomeo asks Rebecca how much longer she is going to cry, only for Rebecca to reveal she has finally remembered her father while recalling several memories of her parents. As Bartolomeo wonders what she is talking about, Sabo notes this must have been the plot that was undermining the country and claims any situation can change if you strike its core. Sabo decides to end this fight and hardens his arms with Armament Haki before driving them into the arena, creating several large cracks that extend all the way to the edges. As Gatz wonders what he did, Sabo uses Dragon Claws Fists: Dragon's Breath, which obliterates the arena. The rest of the fighters land on chunks of rock in the water as Diamante demands to know what Sabo did, prompting Sabo, who is standing on a pillar in the center, to tell him that he is going to win this.
Watching from the stands with a smile on her face, Koala receives a call on her Den Den Mushi from Hack, who asks her if Sabo did something reckless again, prompting Koala to reveal he is going to head underground now. Meanwhile, Gatz notes that the water appears to be draining and admits they can no longer guarantee the safety of the audience before telling everyone to evacuate. Bartolomeo and Rebecca realize the water must be draining into cracks in the foundation of the ring before being thrown off their chunk of rock when it collides with another one. Though Bartolomeo manages to grab onto another chunk of stone, Rebecca wraps her hands around his throat in order to not fall off as well, prompting Bartolomeo to tell her to get off. As Jesus Burgess leaps from rock to rock while proclaiming this is nothing, a large chunk of rock hits him in the back of the head, sending him flying into the water.
When a Fighting Fish leaps toward him, Sabo sees the chest strapped to its back and realizes he has found the one with the Mera Mera no Mi.

Watching from below, Diamante curses Sabo, who leaps toward the chest. Diamante pulls out a club while proclaiming that he will not let Sabo have it, but the rock he is standing on buckles, causing him to fall into the water and lose his strength. As Diamante reveals they were never intending to give anyone the Mera Mera no Mi, Sabo destroys the chest, revealing the fruit, before grabbing it and landing on the pillar once more. Proclaiming that he is the winner, Sabo points out how the rules stated that whoever got the fruit would be the victor, prompting Gatz to announce to the fleeing audience that ""Lucy"" has won.
Sabo takes a bite of the Mera Mera no Mi and states it is disgusting before noticing Bartolomeo losing his grip on the rock and falling. Leaping toward them, Sabo grabs Rebecca out of the air and lets Bartolomeo fall onto one of the rocks below. When Bartolomeo asks him for help, Sabo claims he must help himself because he is a man before announcing that he is going to make one more attack. Sabo takes off his beard, glasses, and helmet, prompting Diamante to recognize him as a member of the Revolutionary Army. Summoning fire around his fist, a surprised Sabo notes he can really create fire as Koala realizes she still has his clothes and leaps into the arena. Sabo proclaims he is a fire now before using Hiken, which destroys what is left of the arena while breaking through its foundation into the Underground Trade Port.

Leo runs up to Usopp and asks him if he is okay as Nico Robin tells the Dwarves to look after him. As the Dwarves carry Usopp away, Leo tells them to not let Trebol lay a single finger on him. Noting they want to destroy the SMILE Factory, Trebol uses Beta Beta Chain, but Robin creates several hands around herself before pushing up a large chunk of rock, which absorbs the force of the attack.

As Hajrudin states it must have been painful to live has toys for over 10 years, Usopp tries to tell him that he is hurting him and to not move his body, but Hajrudin hears ""You do"" instead and points out how they would have lived as slaves were it not for Usopp. Holding Usopp up by his arms, Hajrudin proclaim this is the hero who broke the spell on them as Usopp tries to tell him to stop moving him. The ceiling begins to crack as Hajrudin proclaims this is Captain Usopp, prompting the Dwarves and former toys to cheer.

Doflamingo then unleashes his Birdcage, sealing the entire island in strings. The strings then latch onto people and take control of them, forcing them to attack each other. Pica then rearranges the whole island, levitating areas such as the palace and the Flower Field. Doflamingo announces a game to kill him to break the cage, unless they kill all of the people he is about to name.","Several former toys run through the streets while demanding to know where Doflamingo and proclaiming their intention to destroy the SMILE Factory. At the factory, three guards watch the approaching mob and wonder what they are supposed to do, but one of them points out how no one can enter unless they have a key to the building. As several Dwarves carry Artificial Devil Fruits across the floor of the factory, one of the guards notes that the buildings will remain undamaged even if the ceiling collapses on them because they are made of Seastone. Meanwhile, Diamante and Trebol stand before the oncoming mob. As several warriors rush toward him and attack, Diamante swings his steel cape in front of his body, causing their swords to shatter upon hitting it. Several other warriors prepare to fire at Trebol, who claims it is useless before piercing their bodies with mucus. While Diamante transforms a nearby wooden pole into a large hammer using Lock, Trebol binds more warriors with Beta-Beta Chain. Smashing the rest of the mob away, Diamante berates them for pushing their luck as Trebol slams the bound warriors into the ground with Beta-Betamu. The guard watching from above proclaims that no one can defeat the two of them.
Meanwhile, in Dressrosa, former toys and Donquixote Pirates underlings clash in the streets while the chuckling head of Donquixote Doflamingo notes that they need to do something. As a shocked Trafalgar Law looks at Doflamingo, Kyros proclaims this is creepy before leaping toward Doflamingo and Pica while demanding to know how Doflamingo is still alive. However, he is caught off-guard when Doflamingo appears behind him with his head still attached and asks Kyros if he wants to learn how to kill a person. As Monkey D. Luffy and Viola call out to Kyros, Doflamingo swings his leg toward Kyros's head while stating that this is how it is done. Riku Doldo III yells Kyros's name as the towers of the palace are cut in half, revealing Luffy has pulled Kyros down just in time for Doflamingo's kick to miss him. Noticing Luffy, Doflamingo prepares to swipe at him as the fake Doflamingo's body does the same, causing Baby 5 to realize there are two of him.
Doflamingo and his clone use Goshikito, prompting Luffy to roll out of the way as the joint attack kicks up a large amount of dust. As Kyros apologizes for letting his guard down, Luffy rushes toward Doflamingo, who hardens his coat with Armament Haki, before activating Gear 2 and using Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling, which Doflamingo effortlessly defends against for several seconds before his clone appears behind Luffy and cuts him across the back with Goshikito. Seeing Luffy flying toward him, Doflamingo hardens his fist with Armament Haki before punching Luffy in the face, sending him flying several meters back into a wall. As Doflamingo and his clone stand over Luffy, Kyros wonders what the clone is as the clone begins to unravel into string, causing Viola to note it is like a string marionette. Unraveling the clone with his finger, Doflamingo looks at Riku and asks him if he remembers how he felt when Doflamingo stole his kingdom 10 years ago. When Riku confirms this and demands to know why he is asking, Doflamingo claims that what will soon occur will not be small-scale like that night was.
As Law expresses shock upon hearing this, Riku demands to know what Doflamingo means, only for Doflamingo to state it is time to let them go before ordering Pica to throw everyone out. The ground begins to roll and shift, causing those present to be thrown around before two giant stone hands grab them and move them outside of the castle. While Luffy, Viola, Kyros, and Law fall to the ground below, Riku manages to grab onto the stone and begs Doflamingo to not cause further harm to Dressrosa before being thrown off as well. However, Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Fusen to cushion everyone's fall. Meanwhile, in the castle, Baby 5 and Gladius stand next to Doflamingo, who stops manipulating his clone before deciding to bring an end to everything and gesturing upward with his finger, causing the string composing his clone to begin shooting high into the sky as Doflamingo smiles.
Below the castle, a panting Luffy notes that Doflamingo had them thrown into the garden of the Rampart Tower as Viola states they cannot get near Doflamingo as long as Pica is there. Upon seeing the string spiraling into the sky, a shocked Law notes the Birdcage has begun, causing the others to look at him. Upon reaching a point high above Dressrosa, the string begins falling down in an arc shape toward the edges of the city. Upon seeing the strings piercing the rocks around the city, a pirate asks his captain what it is, only for the captain to decide to get out of the country as soon as possible because they will only be crushed if they stay. However, despite the warning of another one of his crewmates, the captain runs into one of the strings, which slices the top and bottom of his face. Wondering what these bars of string are, the pirates attempt to break through the cage with cannonballs, but the balls are merely sliced to pieces on contact.
Meanwhile, Luffy asks Law what the Birdcage is, prompting Law to reveal that Doflamingo plans to kill everyone on the island before the truth about Dressrosa leaks out, shocking the others. Looking up at the Birdcage, Vice Admiral Bastille wonders what it is as one of his subordinates informs him that he cannot reach Marine Headquarters on his Den Den Mushi. As another of Bastille's subordinates confirms this report, Doflamingo smiles as several Marines and civilians suddenly stiffen up. Something rushes toward Admiral Issho, but he catches it and opens his hand, revealing a string. As Issho realizes what this is, he is distracted by a nearby explosion as people run screaming out of a burning house. When asked why he shot the house, a Marine frantically explains that he cannot control his body before firing at his fellow Marines, causing another explosion. Another Marine tries to stop the fighting, but he stiffens up before taking out his sword and cutting down another Marine near him, confusing him. As a man fires a gun into a crowd while tearfully telling them to duck, Doflamingo moves his fingers up and down before revealing that he is using Parasite.
As Bastille wonders what is going on, a subordinate reveals that people are harming each other at random all over Dressrosa and that some Marines are rampaging as well. The subordinate proclaims that many citizens will die if nothing is done before being interrupted by an explosion, which draws the attention of those present to The King's Plateau sinking into the ground. When Luffy asks him what is going on, Law reveals this is the work of Pica and explains how he can change the geography by merging with the stone in the land. Turning around, Luffy notices the Royal Palace is shifting away and tells it to stop moving. Meanwhile, near the SMILE Factory, the former toys run away from the factory, which is moving up, while wondering what is happening here. The Flower Field begins moving up as well, causing the whole town to be pulled in toward it and leaving hundreds of citizens to fall to the ground below.
After the shifting has stopped, Doflamingo picks up a Den Den Mushi and begins speaking to the citizens and guests of Dressrosa, whom he informs of how he could have ruled with terror from the start as his image appears on screens and on the strings around the country. Doflamingo acknowledges that many of them likely want to kill him now that they have discovered the truth before revealing that he has prepared a game to kill him for them. Stating that he is in the palace and will not leave, Doflamingo admits the game will end if they kill him before revealing that the game will also end if they kill all of the people he is about to name, each of whom he will award a large prize for killing. Stating that it is kill or be killed, Doflamingo proclaims that everyone in the country will become hunters because it is only possible to survive if they kill someone.","Diamante, Trebol, Donquixote Doflamingo, Pica, Trafalgar Law, Kyros, Monkey D.

Episode 681,The 500 Million Man — The Target is Usoland!,8-Feb-15,"As citizens and Marines are forced to attack each other in the streets of Dressrosa, Doflamingo reveals to the island a hit list on the Straw Hat Pirates and their allies, surprisingly, with Usopp having the highest reward. Robin, Usopp, Sabo, Koala, and Hack head for the SMILE Factory, Bartolomeo holds off the freed toys, and Kin'emon leaves to look for Kanjuro. Franky leaves the Toy House and goes to destroy the factory while Trebol and Diamante regroup at the palace. At the palace plateau, Kyros abandons the group to go after Doflamingo. Rebecca contacts Luffy, asking about her father, and Luffy states that he promised to end this game and beat up Doflamingo.","Doflamingo continues his broadcast, informing the Dressrosa citizens that escaping from his Birdcage and communicating with the outside world is impossible. While various citizens try to call for help or to stop them, many scream for others to stay away from them since they can't control themselves. He asks them if they will all be killed because he is using his powers to make random citizens kill others or if they will manage to end his game.
As Issho puts down the controlled Marines, the ex-toys at the underground port are shocked that the SMILE Factory has risen into the air. However, they are confident that this gives them a chance to escape thanks to their ""god,"" Usopp. Meanwhile, Kin'emon, Bartolomeo, and Rebecca meet up with Robin, Usopp, Sabo, Koala, Hack, and the Dwarves in the port. Bartolomeo, while sucking up to Robin, notices that Usopp has a long nose, much like Sogeking, his alias. Robin tells him they are the same, causing Bartolomeo to scream in awe, immensely annoying Sabo and Hack (as the latter is in disbelief his arm was broken by a fool like Bartolomeo). Kin'emon checks on the dwarves, commending them on their battle skills while they check on Kabu and Rampo, who got back from the palace incapacitated.
The carnage in the streets of Dressrosa continues, with many citizens reflecting that this was a lot like the incident he caused ten years ago. Likewise, the controlled citizens and their victims draw similarities to the incident, finally understanding that King Riku and his Army were being controlled that night. As King Riku continues to plead that Doflamingo stop the carnage, Doflamingo offers an ultimatum to the former toys and people screaming for his head: make the wrong choice and come for his head in a never-ending game, or ""bring justice"" to the 12 people on the island that represent the greatest threat to the Donquixote Family. Each target is worth a certain number of ""Stars,"" Doflamingo will pay a bounty of 100,000,000 per star. The bounties are assigned as follows:
1-Star: Rebecca, Nico Robin, Kin'emon, Viola, Franky
2-Stars: Roronoa Zoro, Kyros
3-Stars: Sabo, Monkey D. Luffy, Trafalgar Law, Riku Doldo III
The announcement of the bounties causes a flurry of mixed reactions of shock, disbelief, and excitement; both that some of the targets are even still alive after all this time (King Riku and Kyros), and others that the people are even present on Dressrosa (such as Sabo). Back at the Trade Port, just as Usopp begins to rejoice in being left out, Doflamingo reveals the one who angered him the most and put them in this horrible game, offers a final, extraordinary 5-star bounty just for ""God"" Usopp for his role in the preceding events. This immediately brings horror to Usopp and the Dwarves but great delight to the former toy slaves. Seeing Usopp and various other criminals with stars on their heads, they quickly turn their attention to Robin, Sabo, Rebecca, and Kin'emon for their bounties, who surmise that they must escape quickly, to which Usopp is annoyed over how they worshiped him earlier and now they want him dead. However, while everyone else moves to make it above ground, Kin'emon decides to jump further down to the Scrap Heap under the pretense that Kanjuro may be there.
Doflamingo further asserts that the clock is ticking, as people are being killed by the second due to his manipulation. We are brought back to the streets of Dressrosa, where the citizens who have come to understand King Riku's actions ten years ago now find themselves torn over what to do. Also, Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger notice that Franky has somehow escaped their sight. Franky is on the move to the factory with backup cola, but many pirates go after him for the reward, much to Franky's disgust at the lack of gratitude for Usopp's help. The citizens also see him and try to kill him, but Franky shoves them off and covers himself with his coat, proclaiming Usopp did his part and now he'll destroy the factory. Back at the Trade Port, Bartolomeo urges Robin's group to press on to the above ground as he creates a significant barrier to prevent the former toys from pursuing them. Zoro calls Robin via Den Den Mushi, revealing that he has met up with Luffy and the others who were expelled from the palace by Pica. Luffy takes over the conversation with Robin, bringing each other up to date on current events. They notice that Kyros has gone missing.
Luffy's referring to Kyros as ""Soldier-San,"" as well as Rebecca's memories of the toy soldier, leads her to the revelation that the soldier, the statue at the Corrida Colosseum, and Kyros are her father. As she begins to break down, Luffy encourages her to remain strong. He apologizes that she couldn't eat the Mera Mera no Mi, but in place, he promises to defeat Doflamingo and restore order to the country.","Donquixote Doflamingo, Issho, Bartolomeo, Usopp, Nico Robin, Rebecca, Koala, Hack (Fish-Man), Sabo, Kin'emon, Bobomba, Cotton, Bian, Baxcon (K.O.), Flapper, Inhel, Rampo (K.O.), Kabu (K.O.), Wicca, Leo, Riku Doldo III, Trafalgar Law, Viola, Monkey D.

As Trafalgar Law and Monkey D. Luffy argue over what to do next, Koala investigates the underground trading port and the Marines attempt to restrain the people being controlled by Parasite.
Donquixote Doflamingo meets with his top 3 executives, where he reveals that the Marines will not hinder them in their activities for now. Luffy, Roronoa Zoro, and Law land near several Marines and Donquixote underlings, but they are confronted by Issho.","Nico Robin moves toward the palace with Usopp and Rebecca, while Sabo and Koala split to complete different tasks.
At Luffy's location, Law asks him if he knows what he is going to do and points out how their goal was to destroy the SMILE Factory in order to provoke a conflict between Donquixote Doflamingo and Kaidou. Law claims that Kaidou will turn his anger at losing his SMILEs to them if they kill Doflamingo now. Luffy states that this is not an issue now before demanding to know what will happen to Dressrosa if he stops now.
Meanwhile the citizens of Dressrosa hunt for the people whom Doflamingo placed bounties on. As the Marines escort several captured citizens away from the rest of the soldiers, Bastille asks Issho if they should be trying to capture Doflamingo, only for Issho to order him to tell all units to restrain as many rampaging people as possible and focus on the Straw Hat Pirates-Law alliance.
Back at the plateau, Luffy grabs Law and Zoro in either arm and states they will go, only for Law to remind him that he is still in seastone handcuffs. Viola states she will get the key, revealing that she saw it when they were falling. She states it must be somewhere on this plateau before stopping mid-sentence in surprise upon seeing Luffy running toward the edge of the plateau.
At the underground port, Koala boards one of the ships. She finds a chest filled with firearms and rips off a skull-and-crossbones sticker to reveal the seal of the Kingdom of Doerena. Koala takes a picture and, hearing voices, she hides as several men walk past while discussing what they will do if the Marines find out about their trade with Doflamingo. One of the men states that they just need to destroy the evidence along with the ship. Koala quickly defeats all of the men with ease.
In the city above, the citizens and Marines continue to attack each other against their will as Maynard asks Issho why they will not arrest Doflamingo despite his inability to maintain his status as a Shichibukai after this. Issho notes the Marines have been doing the same thing over and over and states Maynard has been a member for a long time before asking him if he has been listening to these cries of anger all this time. Issho demands to know if the World Government believes it is God, shocking Maynard, who falls back as Issho asks him to honor his decisions.
Meanwhile, at the palace, Diamante notes that the Straw Hat Pirates and Law's target is the SMILE Factory, prompting Trebol to ask Doflamingo if they should not be protecting the factory right now. Doflamingo points out they can not open the doors because they are made of seastone. He then reveals he has the keys to the factory with him before cutting the keys to pieces, which shocks Baby 5 and Trebol. Trebol and Diamante apologize for failing in executing their duties and Doflamingo forgives them. Doflamingo then reveals that he already talked with Issho, and that the Marines will not pursue them, before stating that Issho will die once they are done using him.
In the city the Marines are ordered to restrain those who are still out of control as several of them learn of their orders to pursue the Straw Hat Pirates and Law. Watching the Marines run past him alongside Senor Pink and Dellinger, Machvise notes that the Marines are not antagonizing them. Senor Pink expresses disbelief at Franky having still had the energy to run away and wonders where he went. Elsewhere, Franky runs through the city with his shirt pulled over his head and notes that what he sees in the distance must be the SMILE Factory.
Luffy and fall through the air and are noticed by Senor Pink's group. Luffy and Zoro begin running away from the assembled soldiers. Dellinger catches up to Luffy and disappears from sight before kicking at him, who manages to leap away in time. However, Senor Pink catches Luffy by surprise by swimming in the ground underneath him and grabbing his legs. Machvise appears in the air above them and uses 10-Ton Vise. Luffy manages to stretch himself far enough away for Machvise to miss his body, though his feet become pinned.
Dellinger tries again to hit them, only for Zoro to kick him in the back, causing Dellinger to stumble forward before accidentally kicking Machvise instead, which forces him off of Luffy's feet. As Zoro tells them to go, they are confronted by several warriors who intend to take their heads for Doflamingo's bounties. As they begin opening fire, Zoro rushes forward and effortlessly defeats those in his way while Luffy defeats the others with Gomu Gomu no Gatling.

Robin's group continues to run away from the former toy slaves and intend to make their way to the royal plateau. The fight with Fujitora ends as Pica emerges from the ground as a huge golem. When he speaks, Luffy bursts into hysterical laughter resulting in the latter punching Luffy causing a large shockwave sending him and Zoro flying.","Luffy demands Fujitora move, but he refuses, so Luffy puts Law down, engages in combat with Fujitora, and embeds his arm in Busoshoku Haki.
At the palace, Doflamingo hears Luffy fighting Fujitora, and Pica offers to take down all their enemies. Pica offers to take down all their enemies alone, but Pica's high-pitched voice catches a subordinate off guard, and he struggles to hold in a laugh as another tells him hurriedly that laughing will get him killed. Doflamingo says there's no need to be hasty, as he is confident that his game will cause the citizens to choose the Donquixote Family over the Riku family. As Pica begins to reply, the subordinate can no longer control himself and laughs. This action immediately catches the attention of Doflamingo and the senior executives, much to the soldier's dismay. As Pica is about to entomb the subordinate in stone for his laughter, Baby 5 instead shoots him to prevent Pica's wrath from going out of control, knocking the subordinate off the plateau. Doflamingo explains that he lost his mother at eight years old and killed his father at age ten and that the executives and above have shared joy and sorrow with him therefore considers them his closest family; they are all which Doflamingo has therefore he will not tolerate anyone laughing at his family which his subordinates quickly comply with.
In the Colosseum, Robin's group continues to evade the former toys chasing their bounties, with Bartolomeo and Hack backing them up. Robin determines that the landscape shift has placed the Colosseum next to the Royal Plateau, so they meet with the others. While Viola locates the key to Law's cuffs, she is happy to see Rebecca below, while Tank Lepanto protects the latter. The commotion on the island catches everyone's attention until, eventually, Pica emerges from the landscape to tower above the island. As he says he will deal with those who stand against his family, Luffy starts laughing at the high pitch of his voice, infuriating Pica. The soldiers of Doflamingo's crew shout at Luffy to stop laughing about Pica, as the latter has a complex about his high-pitched voice. An enraged Pica then aims a fist at Luffy as the citizens run away in fear. Issho notices something terrible is happening, though he is oblivious to what exactly. As Luffy, Zoro, and Law run from Pica, the latter two tell the former to stop laughing at Pica, though they are trying hard to keep from laughing themselves.

As Zoro prepares to draw his sword, Cavendish recognizes Law and attacks him because he is one of the Eleven Supernovas, which stole his fame. Luffy stops Cavendish, saying that Law is his friend, which Law loudly denies. Luffy asks Cavendish if he still hates him, to which Cavendish replies no due to Usopp rescuing him from being a toy. Cavendish then hands Law his hat, which he found in front of the Colosseum, and offers to put it on for him, which Law quickly declines. Cavendish then tells Luffy that as repayment for rescuing him, he'll kill Doflamingo so the Straw Hat Pirates can hide. Luffy declines the offer, saying he has to defeat Doflamingo to repay Rebecca for giving him lunch, leading Law and Cavendish to question his motives. Cavendish believes Luffy wants to defeat Doflamingo to become more popular and gain the press' attention.
Suddenly, Chinjao, Sai, and Boo appear, their grudge against Luffy gone, and now they are ready to defeat Doflamingo to repay Usopp, which annoys Luffy due to him wanting to defeat Doflamingo.

Dagama tries to give a strategy for Pica but mentions that running is their best option for surviving for now.
The fighters run away from Pica's second attack, which destroys more of Dressrosa, and the fighters are at a loss on how to get through Pica to Doflamingo's castle.

Robin's group reaches Viola and Doldo's location and plan their next move. Rebecca and Bartolomeo offer to give Law's handcuffs key to Luffy. Doldo is hesitant to trust pirates, but with Viola's and Leo's persuasion, believing the pirates are the only ones who can help them since the Government has allowed Doflamingo to do as he pleases, they believe the Straw Hats are the only ones who can save them. Meanwhile, Franky tries to destroy the factory but is interrupted by Senor Pink, and they engage in another battle.","The fighters below notice that Pica's stone body has frozen, and take advantage of this to head for Doflamingo's castle, intent on his head.

Suddenly, Law snaps out of his thought, admitting to Luffy that his plan had been a detour to crush Doflamingo, but that he, too, wanted to repay the Shichibukai after losing to him before. He then tells Luffy how Doflamingo took away the most important person to him 13 years ago. This person was Corazon, his benefactor and the former top executive of the Donquixote family, as well as Doflamingo's biological younger brother.
Pica's larger stone body remains still due to his confrontation with Roronoa Zoro, allowing the Colosseum group to push forward. The Donquixote Family subordinates attempt to hold them off, but to no avail.

A map of Dressrosa is shown, showing the locations of: Zoro as he battles Pica; Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law as they reach the first level of the palace; the Colosseum group advancing towards the Marines; and Kyros fighting his way through individually. The Dressrosa citizens attempt to reason with Kyros to give himself up without a fight. They explain that they aren't interested in his bounty, but that their deaths are guaranteed if all of the bounties aren't collected. Kyros empathizes with their logic, but tells them that he too must accomplish something, charging at them. At the former Royal Plateau, Nico Robin's group reach King Riku and Viola from the Colosseum, along with Tank Lepanto. Bartolomeo is disappointed that Luffy is not there, while Leo and the Tontatta are confused by Pica's larger form and the new location of the Royal Palace. Rebecca points out that they still have pursuers, but Robin easily dispatches them by making the net she had created for climbing up the plateau disappear.
Viola finds the key to Law's handcuffs, and expresses her intent to free him. King Riku attempts to persuade her otherwise, because Law and Luffy are pirates, but she replies that is precisely why they are the ones who can truly help their country. She goes on to say that the World Government granting Donquixote Doflamingo a special status and protection as a pirate is precisely how their country ended up in this predicament, and therefore she has no interest in their definition of justice. She claims they only listen to the cries of the people when it is convenient for them, whereas the Straw Hats have acted from a place of sincerity. The Tontatta agree, and bring King Riku up-to-date on how Usopp was responsible for the lifting the curse of the Hobi Hobi no Mi. They tell him that they also support the Straw Hats wholeheartedly. Rebecca decides that she will get the key to Luffy, with Bartolomeo enthusiastically asking to come along as well so he can see Luffy again. Viola warns her niece of the danger, but Rebecca assures her that she will be fine. This prompts Leo and Kabu to also offer to accompany Rebecca for further support. Everyone agrees to meet up again at the Royal Plateau afterwards.
Franky finally reaches to the factory, and prepares to fire his Radical Beam. However, before he can release it, Senor Pink emerges and attacks him, wishing to continue their previous fight.","Monkey D. Luffy, Abdullah, Jeet, Trafalgar D.

Bastille warns his men to back off as he faces Sabo, whose martial skills are more than a match for the Marines and the vice admiral. Issho provided support by calling down a meteorite but forgot about the Birdcage and the resulting damage was wider than expected. Sabo then walks out of the fire, having defeated Bastille and ready to fight Issho.","At the Royal Palace, the Colosseum group has begun to climb the palace. This alarms the executives, as they were confident that the attackers would not make it through the Marines. As Luffy fights his way through level 1 of the new royal plateau, the Colosseum group catches up to him. Baby 5 notices that the Marines are being held back by a large wall of flame. Fujitora asks Sabo if there's no way he can convince the Revolutionary to move. As a member of the Revolutionary Army , Sabo explains that he will not let anyone pass who attempts to bring harm to Luffy or his allies. He then corrects himself, saying that he is also doing this as a big brother. This leads Fujitora to question just whose brother Sabo is.
Bastille warns his men to stay away from Sabo due to him being a Logia user. The Marines shoot at Sabo but his body is immune to damage because of his Logia powers. One Marine notes comment's on how strong Sabo's fingers are but Sabo corrects him calling them ""claws"" as he crushes a bazooka with one hand. He makes the bazooka explode as Bastille tells them to move as he'll deal with the Revolutionary. Sabo easily breaks Bastille's blade with his fingers as the vice admiral curses him. Sabo then grabs his head and states he can crush a skull like an egg as he breaks Bastille's mask. Just then, Issho brings down a meteor wondering if it can break through Doflamingo's Birdcage. However, the cage merely slices the meteor to bits causing great destruction to the kingdom. Fujitora realizes his mistake and hopes no one was hurt while his men ask that he warns them before he uses his powers again. He then asks Sabo if he's aware of the predicament he's in but Sabo merely notes he's still having trouble controlling Ace's powers as he reveals he beat Bastille.
Fujitora notes that Ace was Luffy's brother and realizes Sabo is the same. Sabo confirms this stating they shared drinks together and have an unshakable bond which causes several Marines to be shocked by Luffy's brothers. Sabo mentions that should Luffy ever need help, he will be there for him. He has a flashback how he discovered Ace's death and refuses to let anything happen to his loved ones again and clashes with Fujitora.","Orlumbus, Sai, Boo, Cavendish, Blue Gilly , Elizabello II, Ideo , Dagama, Chinjao, Dellinger, Machvise, Gladius, Baby 5, Suleiman, Lao G, Monkey D.

Episode 688,A Desperate Situation - Luffy Gets Caught in a Trap!,12-Apr-15,"At the palace hills, Luffy is still riding Ucy towards the palace but was dejected to see that the rest of the colosseum fighters are ahead of him in the race to fight Doflamingo. After a little help from the Funk brothers pointing out a shortcut, Luffy and Ucy enter a tunnel. While inside, Law warns Luffy that facing Donquixote Doflamingo while he is still handcuffed will be suicide. A call from Robin solves that issue as she is sending Leo, Rebecca, and Bartolomeo to deliver the cuff keys to them.
At the plateau, Bartolomeo, Robin, and Rebecca are taking an unorthodox method of traveling to the palace hills flower field by ""jumping"" through the use of the beetles provided by Leo.
Back in the tunnel, the two captains find themselves in a dead end and are surprised to see Doflamingo waiting for them there.","Meanwhile, on Level 1 of the platform, Luffy, Ucy, Abddullah and Jeet and Law charge through the soldiers of the Donquixote Family. Just then, Luffy sees Cavendish as he states they found a short cut and are going ahead of Luffy. The other fighters charge forward fighting the other soldiers. As Luffy and Ucy are being shot at, Kelly Funk (while using Bobby Funk's body) fights them off telling them to stay away from Straw Hat. After Kelly reintroduces himself to Luffy he tells him he found a secret passage that will lead them to the top of the castle. As they run Law questions Luffy when he will have the key to his cuffs off. Law questions if he really intends to fight Doflamingo while he's handicap but Luffy states it will all work out but Law retorts how Luffy can remain so positive. Kelly then leads them to the passage and as they enter Abddullah and Jeet fall off Ucy, much to Law's and Kelly's shock. Luffy and Law keep going as Luffy gets a call from Robin as she informs Luffy they have the key to Law's cuffs. Robin states they'll reach them with Rebecca and Bartolomeo at the Sunflower fields. Though Luffy reaffirms Law that this worked out Law states only cause of dumb luck.
Back at the former royal plateau, Bartolomeo, Nico Robin, and Rebecca are confused by the Tontatta's suggestion to take stag beetles to the Flower Field on the 4th level. Leo explains that the beetles provide ""jumping service"" instead, since humans are too big to fly. They jump off the cliff, and notice that the beetles fly in a circle among each other to not fly them, but keep them afloat in the air. Leo further explains that if they land on a roof, they can then jump to receive more altitude and continue to float. They head to the Flower Fields, with Leo warning them to be wary of attacks from below.
At the SMILE's factory, Franky continues his fight with Senior Pink but the latter can't seem to harm him as Pink continues swimming out of reach. The Dwarves notice this as Inhel prepares a plan.

Luffy's Tide-turning Elephant Gun,19-Apr-15,"Doflamingo's ambush for Luffy and Law is cut short when he is skewered by Abdullah and Jeet, only to be exposed as another string clone. The two captains then learn how Kelly Funk betrayed them, only to be betrayed by Doflamingo in return. Luffy then decides to make his own shortcut by punching a hole in the roof and carrying Law, while leaving Ucy with the two bounty hunters.
At the SMILE Factory, the dwarves can help Franky in opening the doors, but first he has to deal with Senor Pink. Sabo is locked in a struggle with Issho. Doflamingo, still at the top of the palace, talks with Diamante and Trebol, reminiscing when they first met Law when he was a child, who wanted to join his crew to destroy everything in sight because he doesn't have much time to live.","Donquixote Doflamingo confronts Monkey D. Luffy, Trafalgar Law, and Ucy, as they have fallen into a slanted well on the first level of the royal plateau. Angered by his presence, Luffy immediately attempts to punch Doflamingo but he blocks it effortlessly. After mocking them for getting caught into the trap, Doflamingo fires multiple string shots at the bull that incapacitates him and also knocks Luffy into the water. He mocks them further about how easily they were defeated, but in spite of this he commends Luffy for his ability to gather allies, especially under these circumstances. He wonders why Law would choose Luffy, and chides Law for being a coward. This upsets Law, who shouts that he will never be like Doflamingo, after having been ""saved"". As Doflamingo prepares to fire another bullet string, he is slashed and pierced from behind by Abdullah and Jeet.
Meanwhile, Kyros is on the move and is taken aim by a bounty hunter. Luckily, an old man stops him and Kyros saves the old man. Though the civilian now holds the gun on Kyros, the latter convinces him to let him go and take down Doflamingo.
Back at the tunnel the Doflamingo turns out to be a clone as well, but Abdullah and Jeet instead get Luffy, Law, and the Bull out of the water. After saving them, Jeet reveals that Kelly Funk betrayed them; however the clone Doflamingo showed up and slashed him down. Abdullah updates Law and Luffy that the Colosseum army has reached the 2nd level, meanwhile Kyros makes it to the first level. The Donquixote executives notice that none of the Colosseum Army has been halted by the Marines, and brace themselves for battle. Luffy punches through the ceiling of the well, creating his own passageway to the second level right in front of the Colosseum army. As Gladius berates the Donquixote subordinates for getting distracted, Chinjao takes advantage of the chaos in wake of Luffy's actions and presses toward the third level.
Bartolomeo, Nico Robin, and Rebecca continue marching forward and are shot at from below. Bartolomeo scares them away by taking his pants off and prepare to pee on them like at the Coliseum.
At the SMILE Factory location, Inhel and the other Tontatta have arrived. They announce to Franky that they have a plan for getting in, but require him to deal with Senor Pink first. He agrees to do so, while being slammed by Pink from behind. On the ground level, Sabo is still clashing intensely with Admiral Fujitora.
In the royal palace, Doflamingo comments that his clone was not able to accomplish its objective. He asks Diamante and Trebol if they remember the day they met Law. Diamante reflects on how crazy he was, while Doflamingo laments that he must kill him, as he remembers how Law used to resemble him. He recollects his first memory of a young Law: a young child has infiltrated his lair, with his entire body covered in explosives. He asks Doflamingo to let him join his crew, as he wants to destroy everything that he sees. He goes on to say that he was raised in the white city, and doesn't have much time to live.","Monkey D.

In the meantime, the Pink Bee Squad informs the dwarf slaves in the SMILE Factory that they have been tricked, and the enslaved dwarves are now fighting against their overseers.
Meanwhile, the colosseum fighters are struggling against the officers while Cavendish offers Luffy and Law a ride to the palace. Kyros joins Luffy's party, and they arrive at the battle taking place in the palace's plateau. Realizing they have no chance against Doflamingo themselves if they cannot even easily beat the officers, they put aside their pride and allow Luffy and co. to move forward, while improving their progress in the fight by working together.","Bellamy reaches the palace rooftop, and Doflamingo asks him why he came. Bellamy then asks if it was really Doflamingo who sent Dellinger to kill him, wondering if he can no longer do anything for Doflamingo. Doflamingo laughs, and tells his former underling that the two of them had different goals from the start. While Bellamy was content to be an ordinary pirate, Doflamingo's main goal was to destroy the world, which seemingly horrifies Bellamy.
Elsewhere, the Corrida Colosseum fighters continue toward Doflamingo's castle. However, Dellinger focuses on one fighter: Suleiman. Several apparitions of Dellinger surround Suleiman, and the Donquixote officer rams into the combatant, stabbing him with his horns. The other fighters are shocked to see Suleiman go down, and turn their attention to the other officers. Chinjao, however, pays them no mind, as he has already climbed to the third floor of the palace. However, Gladius uses his powers to blow up part of the wall, causing Chinjao to fall. Boo is shocked at this turn of events, and does not notice a ten-ton Machvise falling on top of him until it is too late. The Dressrosa soldiers cheer as the tables are turned on the Colosseum fighters, while Lao G and Baby 5 deal with Orlumbus and Dagama, respectively.
In the south of the Dressrosa village, the citizens of Dressrosa manage to tie down one of the citizens who had been controlled by Parasite. The controlled citizen tearfully apologizes for all the atrocious actions he was forced to do, but the other citizens know it was not his fault. Just then, another citizen races toward them, exclaiming that he knew where King Riku and ""God"" Usopp were. Eager to end Doflamingo's game as soon as possible, the citizens take up arms and prepare to capture the two alive, using their ""prisoners"" as bait.
At the SMILE Factory, the overseers force the enslaved dwarves to clean up a spilled SAD container, and attempt to draw their attention away from the chaos outside by whipping them and continuing to tell them about Princess Mansherry's ""illness"". As the overseers bark out orders, however, the dwarves notice words on the outside of their cage, asking them to open the lock from the inside. The dwarves realize that the words were formed by pink bees and that Bian, Inhel, and Wicca were trying to contact them. The three dwarves on the outside see that the dwarf slaves noticed their message, and Bian instructs the bees to form the next message, which explains that they have been tricked. This message greatly confuses the dwarf slaves, and the overseers start to get angry at them for not working. Just then, the pink bees' final message forms, ordering them to fight. The dwarf slaves, though not entirely sure what is going on, know that their friends would never lie to them and start attacking the overseers.
Meanwhile, Cavendish, Luffy, Law, and Kyros (the latter of whom is unseen to the former three) ride on Farul toward a wall behind which are the Doflamingo officers. Luffy is intent on defeating them right away, while Cavendish intends to climb up to the third floor. Suddenly, the two of them notice Kyros sitting behind them, which causes Cavendish to get angry and Luffy to get excited. Kyros says that he had followed the trail that Luffy had made, and an angry Cavendish calls him a stalker and yells at him to get off because Farul cannot hold three people. Luffy tells Kyros that they will be meeting up with Rebecca soon, and the former combatant is shocked and angry to find that his daughter is behind enemy lines. He asks Luffy why he did not stop her, since Rebecca is on Doflamingo's wanted list. Luffy reassures him, saying that Rebecca was with one of his crewmates, and Kyros states that there is only one thing he wants to do: kill Diamante, the man who killed his wife. Luffy asks Kyros if he intends to die, which Kyros denies, and that coupled with Cavendish's pleas for one of them to get off his horse cause them to take their eyes off the path. Before they know it, they are in the midst of the Colosseum combatants—Donquixote agents battle.
The arrival of Luffy causes the Colosseum fighters to become more organized in their attacks, surprising the Donquixote agents.

Kin'emon has finally found Kanjuro who was hiding in the walls of the scrap heap. After a brief reunion, Kanjuro uses his ability to create a poorly drawn sparrow to fly them out to the surface, but the trapped Dressrosa citizens and soldiers begged to be taken along as well to which Kanjuro makes rather crude ladders for them to climb out. Once Luffy and co reached the third level, the group ran into several giant puppet soldiers blocking their path to the fourth level.","The arrival of Luffy causes the Colosseum fighters to become more organized in their attacks, surprising the Donquixote agents. The fighters unanimously agree to hold off the Donquixote agents in order to get Luffy, Cavendish, and Kyros to Doflamingo. Elizabello, Blue Gilly, and Ideo block the soldiers allowing Luffy and the others to move per command by Dagama. Annoyed, Dellinger headbutt-stabs Dagama, shocking Luffy, but Dagama suddenly wraps himself around Dellinger, trapping the Donquixote agent. He yells at the four of them to keep going, and Luffy and Cavendish use the Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling and Biken: Saint Exupery to blast the Dressrosa soldiers away.
In the scrap yard of Dressrosa, Kin'emon finds his friend Kanjuro and, as a result of the reunion, sheds tears of joy. Dressrosa soldiers note how Kanjuro came out of the wall while Kin'emon apologizes for making him wait. Kanjuro states there is no need for apologies and states he knew he would return for him, as he eats a self-drawn cabbage in hand. He offers some to Kin'emon, who refuses, stating his cabbage makes his stomach hurt. He tells Kanjuro that he has much to tell him and that they must leave immediately due to the situation on top of Dressrosa. Kanjuro agrees and draws a bird on the wall and shouts ""come forth"" as his drawing comes to life, much to the shock of the Dressrosa citizens and soldiers. They note that despite the fact that the sketch is alive, his artwork is terrible and seems hardly capable of flight. Before they leave, one of the trapped citizens asks the samurai to let the others accompany them, stating they all have family on the island and wish to reunite with them. Kanjuro helped the trapped citizens and soldiers by drawing crude ladders towards the surface (though they complain about how horrible the ladders were drawn).
The scene changes back to the battlefield of Dressrosa as members of the Donquixote Family try to stop Luffy, Law, Cavendish and Kyros (all riding Farul) from moving forward, only to end up getting kicked back by Blue Gilly. Dellinger then rushes from behind and kicks him with his Decapitation High Heel and defeats him. Luffy notices this but is told not to get distracted by Cavendish. He goes on stating Doflamingo's whole Bird Cage game is a farce and that even if they deliver all 12 of the people on Doflamingo's hit list, he will never let anyone live now that the knowledge of his arms dealing and toy operation is out. In other words, everyone is guaranteed dead. He states that Doflamingo will stop at nothing to make sure that that information isn't leaked out, effectively isolating the island of Dressrosa from the rest of the world. In other words, the only way to survive and make it off the island is to take Doflamingo's head. He states that though Doflamingo is one step ahead of everyone, his grave error is having so many powerful fighters on the island, including Sai, Ideo and Hajrudin, who face off against the Donquixote Family Officers. Once Cavendish states that he will be taking Doflamingo's head, Luffy, Law and Kyros all disagree and reply that they will be taking Doflamingo's head. Luffy reminds Kyros that he wanted to have Diamante's head, but Kyros replies that by taking Doflamingo's head, he would be restoring King Riku's honor, and would be repaying his 10 year debt. This prompts Law to state he has a thirteen year old debt and Luffy stating he has a thirty year old one, which has Cavendish snapping at him for lying to make himself look good. Once they arrive at the third level they are confronted by large toy puppets.","Cavendish, Farul, Monkey D.

Rebecca takes notice of Pica in fear while Robin asks Zoro to keep Pica busy so they can reach the fourth level. Zoro agrees just as Bartolomeo notices Pica has merged once again with the large stone body. Pica aims his fist at them as Bartolomeo panics, stating he won't be able to block something so large. Zoro then uses Santoryu: 1080 Pound Cannon on the large stone arm, finally injuring Pica. As Rebecca and Robin stare in relief and amazement, Zoro tells Pica that the Straw Hats biggest threats aren't composed of just ""God Usopp"" and ""Straw Hat Luffy"", but himself as well, stating he will one day become the greatest swordsman in the world and that Pica was never in his league to begin with. Bartolomeo then weeps uncontrollably at Zoro's actions.
At the SMILE factory, the Dwarves continue to fight against the Donquixote staff. The staff member who whipped Chao, trying to defend himself, lied to the dwarf, saying that Mansherry would not be healed.

Usopp says she should be out cold after his face for at least two or three days. Viola worries since Luffy doesn't know of her ability and they are in trouble. At the palace, Sugar screams in terror seeing a foot soldier with a long nose and giving her sausages for food to which Sugar yells at him that people with long noses should die and she won't eat anything that looks like a long nose and only wants grapes. She then turns him into a nutcracker toy while frustrated over failing Doflamingo and swears she'll turn everyone in the country into toys, especially Usopp. Usopp tells his crew about the seriousness of Sugar back on the loose. He remembers how he forgot Robin when she was turned into a toy, and is desperate not to forget Luffy as well. He is prepared to do anything at any cost to protect his captain from Sugar, but Kanjuro asks him how he is going to do anything when he is so far away from the palace and especially since Luffy and Sugar are within the palace walls. Usopp replies that he has no other choice as he readies his Kabuto, and is ready to fulfill his role as the Straw Hat Pirates' sniper by providing support from afar.
As they reach the third level Robin notes there are some black balls heading towards them as she tries to warn Bartolomeo, but the latter is too entranced with working together with the Straw Hats and is attacked in explosions. As Bartolomeo falls Kabu warns them of the Pamu Pamu no Mi as Robin begins to fall as well. Gladius sees them and goes after Rebecca noting he didn't see people coming from above, but Robin uses her powers and grabs him telling Rebecca she'll deal with Gladius and tells her to move on ahead. Just then, Luffy sees something falling from the sky as Bartolomeo lands on a soldier as Robin flies herself down. As Robin gets reacquainted with Luffy, Law demands the key to his cuffs. Gladius falls down to as he curses Rebecca escaping while musing she was able to escape by herself swearing he will finish her himself.

Rebecca stays to wait for Luffy, but her brief respite turns to horror when she sees her mother's killer, Diamante, standing before her. Gladius first attacks with multiple rupture balls sent at Luffy, but Bartolomeo blocks them with a large barrier, which he then converts into a long staircase towards the 4th level.
Sabo's fight with Fujitora continues as the Admiral creates a horizontal gravity force that pushes Sabo back. Sabo, on the other hand, wonders if the Admiral is hiding something.
As Luffy climbs the stairs, Gladius attacks him again, but Bartolomeo takes it head on, leaving him injured. Robin thanks him for helping Luffy since the Straw Hats always knew Luffy as their winning trump card. Cavendish remains behind to stall the nutcrackers while Kyros moves ahead to the 4th level.","At the flower fields Rebecca's group makes it while she worries over Robin but Leo reassures her that she and the crew are strong. Leo says they must go to save Mansherry and asks Rebecca if she'll be fine on her own. She says she'll be fine that Luffy and his friends should be at the fields any minute. As Leo and Kabu leave Rebecca notes that her father is out there somewhere also. Just then a noise is heard in the fields as a figure gets up from the thick flower field. The figure reveals himself to be Diamante who smiles at Rebecca's sudden appearance while Rebecca is horrified by his presence.
On Level 3 of the Royal Palace Plateau, Gladius fires several Rupture Balls at Luffy's party, but Bartolomeo blocks them with a barrier. He then creates a staircase using the barrier, excitedly telling an excited Luffy to use it. Luffy thanks Bartolomeo, and the latter thinks about his adoration of the former, thanking him for his mere existence.
Elsewhere, the fight between Fujitora and Sabo continues. The admiral asks Sabo about his objectives, but Sabo knows he is not acting seriously. Fujitora asks Sabo to sympathize with him because he is blind, but the Revolutionary says that he will not treat him differently from any other enemy. Fujitora, states that he has a title to keep and decides to be serious, unleashing Gravity Sword: Fierce Tiger which creates a gravitational force that presses on everything to his left. Sabo races to attack Fujitora, excited that he was able to get the admiral serious, while wondering what his true plan is. Fujitora manages to counter his strike, and states that if Sabo wants to play this ""game"" against him, he must be prepared to forfeit his life if he loses.
At the flower fields, Diamante explains he top executives are guarding the palace thinking no one would reach them but is surprised to see Rebecca. He takes delight laughing seeing Rebecca while the latter can't say anything too horrified by Diamante's appearance.
Picking up the still-handcuffed Law, Luffy races up the stairs, but the toy nutcrackers attempt to climb up the sides and block them. Kyros, however, races ahead and slashes their heads off at the mouth, before continuing ahead up the stairs first. Cavendish tells the three that he'll take care of the rest of the nutcrackers while they go ahead, citing his desire to avenge Farul as the reason.
Suddenly, Gladius throws some Rupture Balls at the staircase, but Bartolomeo blocks it, this time using his body instead of his barriers. Cavendish angrily asks him why he didn't use barriers, but Bartolomeo explains that there's a limit on the surface area of his barriers, and the stairs took up all of it. He states that he would gladly do anything, even give up his life, for Luffy. Cavendish is angry, but says he'll fight alongside the combatant until he can use his barriers again. Suddenly, a nutcracker tries to attack Bartolomeo, but it is quickly finished by Nico Robin, using Cinco Mano: Spank without even looking at it. Robin empathizes with Bartolomeo, stating that Luffy was worth betting their lives on, before going on the declare that he is the winning trump card. Scenes of various allies and crewmembers in the midst of their battles are shown as Robin makes her statement.

After meeting with Rebecca, Luffy and Law head for the palace. Diamante attempts to stop them, but the two manage to escape into the palace. However, Sugar is heading for them, eager to turn the two into toys and gain revenge.","Luffy and Law race up Bartolomeo's staircase, with Luffy intent on beating Kyros to get to Doflamingo. However, Law tells him to focus on the nutcracker pursuing them.
On the Flower Field, Diamante brutally attacks Rebecca, the force of his attacks sending her sprawling on the ground. One of his strikes sends her reeling a large distance, causing the key to Law's handcuffs to fly away from her, and Rebecca remembers how she was entrusted with the key. Diamante taunts Rebecca, mocking her performance in the Corrida Colosseum finals and saying that she would be no match against Doflamingo, but that he would gladly battle her if she intended to avenge Scarlett. To his surprise, Rebecca runs away, carrying the key with her. Despite Diamante's taunts, Rebecca knew that she was no match for the Donquixote executive and all she could do now was give Luffy the key. However, Diamante uses his Devil Fruit powers to elongate his sword and slash Rebecca in the back, sending her crashing into the ground.
Diamante then stands over Rebecca, eager to finish the gladiator off. However, he decides to pull out his gun so he can kill Rebecca the same way he killed Scarlett. A bawling and desperate Rebecca then calls out Thunder Soldier's name as Diamante pulls the trigger. Right then, however, Kyros reaches the Flower Field and rushes at Diamante, slashing the Donquixote executive across the midsection. As Diamante falls, Rebecca looks at Kyros and remembers how he raised her as a toy, even when she did not know his identity, and taught her to fight despite her not wanting to. Kyros then apologized to Rebecca for forcing her to fight, as she was a peaceful person like her mother. Kyros assures his daughter that now she would never have to fight again, as Diamante gets back up. Kyros and Diamante attack each other, furiously exchanging blows.
While Rebecca watches the two fight, she suddenly hears Luffy calling out her name and sees Luffy approaching the staircase while being chased by the nutcracker. Luffy yells at Rebecca to throw him the key to Law's handcuffs, as he bounces off the nutcracker and flies through the air. With the nutcracker leaping after him, Luffy uses his Devil Fruit powers to take the key from Rebecca's hand before he and Law are swallowed by the nutcracker. A shocked Rebecca sinks to her knees, when suddenly Law activates ROOM around the nutcracker and cuts it to pieces. Luffy and Law then descend down to the Flower Field, and Law expresses relief at the removal of his Seastone handcuffs.
Diamante sees the two and in a fit of rage rushes toward them, but Kyros intercepts him. Kyros tells Luffy and Law that he has his hands full with Diamante, asking them to go after Doflamingo for him. Luffy asks Rebecca if she is glad to see her father again, which she tearfully affirms. Luffy and Law then head toward the palace, but Rebecca cries out to Luffy again, asking him if he is really going to defeat Doflamingo. Luffy simply puts on his Straw Hat and says to Rebecca that he is not Lucy, revealing that he is Straw Hat Luffy and that he will become king of the pirates. This enrages Diamante further, and he uses his Devil Fruit powers to extend his sword towards Luffy and Law. However, Law uses Shambles to switch himself and Luffy with a barrel, thereby teleporting them into the palace.
Inside the palace, Law uses Mes to remove the bullets that Doflamingo shot him with, bitterly realizing that they were made of lead. Down the hall, a Donquixote Pirate reports back to Sugar on a Den Den Mushi that Luffy and Law are in the palace. Sugar gleefully walks down the palace hall, spotting her two targets. On the King's Plateau, meanwhile, Usopp desperately tells Kanjuro to hurry up with his drawing, as they barely had any time left. Sugar draws nearer to the unsuspecting Luffy and Law, eager to gain revenge for her ten years of work being undone by turning them into toys and effectively erasing their existence.","Monkey D.

He has Viola use her ability while Doldo, Hack, Tank, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro hold the citizens off as long as they can. Scared that he will lose his captain and friend, Usopp will attempt an impossible shot at Sugar from the plateau before the citizens stop him. With Viola's insight, he prepares to fire the special shot prepared with Kanjuro's help but at the last moment sees Luffy's aura and fires before the Dressrosa citizens catch him and everyone else with him. Viola watches as the shot successfully reaches Sugar, where it takes the shape of Usopp's face, which first defeated Sugar, scaring her again into unconsciousness. With the last obstacle gone, Luffy and Law finally reach Doflamingo himself.","Kanjuro finishes his artwork and Usopp uses it as ammunition he dubs as ""Bagworm"". He is aided by Viola's ability to snipe at Sugar. Usopp replies that he has no other choice as he readies his Kabuto, and is ready to fulfill his role as the Straw Hat Pirates' sniper by providing support from afar. Kin'emon asks if there is any way they can help, and Riku tells Hack and Tank Lepanto to help him protect Usopp and himself from the bounty-seeking mob, who are getting closer and closer using Kanjuro's net, but also tells them not to hurt any of the people. Usopp prepares his shot with the help of Viola's powers, when the mob reaches the top of the plateau.
The mob prepares to capture Riku, Viola, Kin'emon, and Usopp and take them to Doflamingo, and Kin'emon offers his assistance against them. Right then, Sugar approaches Luffy and Law, and the former wonders who she is. She feigns innocence claiming she's lost as she tries to get closer to them. As Riku unsuccessfully tries to get the mob to stop, Viola guides Usopp towards Luffy, Law, and Sugar's location. The Kabuto aims for the lower part of the center palace window, and as Sugar draws closer and closer to Luffy and Law, Usopp takes aim, determined not to lose his captain. Not wanting to let Sugar get his way, Usopp prepares to fire his Great Black Kabuto, when suddenly he realizes with a shock that he can see Luffy, Law, and Sugar's auras. As the mob gets closer to him, Usopp finally fires his Bagworm Star.
The mob finally gets their hands on Usopp, but all he can think about is the shot's trajectory. Knowing there is a slight tailwind, Usopp put in two gunpowder boosters to help the shot go farther, and made sure that the outer wrappings would fall away so that his shot would definitely hit Sugar. However, he knew that even if it missed a little, it would still work as the shot was meant to induce trauma. This becomes clear when the shot is revealed to be a replica of the expression Usopp made that knocked out Sugar the first time. It works, and Sugar is once again scared into unconsciousness. This shocks the Donquixote Pirates and confuses Luffy and Law as Usopp's face projectile is absorbed into the wall and becomes a drawing, and it is revealed that the projectile was a drawing made by Kanjuro. With her defeat, the giant nutcrackers are turned human again. Back at the King's Plateau, Viola congratulates a tied-up and beaten Usopp, and it is revealed that the mob managed to tie up all their targets, but were sent into shock by Viola's arrival. Viola confirms that Law and Luffy have managed to reach Doflamingo.
At that moment, Luffy and Law stand face to face with Doflamingo and Trebol, with Bellamy unconscious on the ground. The Shichibukai asks them why they have come, and they both reply that they have come to beat him.

At the palace, Doflamingo questions Luffy's decision to help a former enemy like Bellamy, but he tells him that the past is behind him. Doflamingo then berates Bellamy, calling him a lowlife. Angered, Luffy tries to kick Doflamingo but hits Bellamy instead when the Shichibukai uses him like a shield. Law admonishes Luffy to not get angry since Doflamingo likes to provoke his enemies. Doflamingo then tells the duo that he is sick of them ruining his plans and that they remind him of the anger he experienced 13 years ago. Law says if it weren't for that time, he wouldn't be standing here, but Doflamingo retorts that if he didn't do it, he would have been the ""third Corazon"" and then attacks Law with a string clone. All the while, Luffy fights a controlled Bellamy. Mad at the Shichibukai for sitting through the fight, Luffy tells Law that he is going to take down Doflamingo and readies an attack on Law. Law then creates a ROOM and switches with Doflamingo, causing him to be struck by Luffy's ""Red Hawk."" Trebol is shocked by this surprise before being incapacitated by Law's ""Radio Knife.""

Shortly, the nutcrackers turn back into people, with eight people being used to make each nutcracker. Bartolomeo rejoices that he can make barriers again, Cavendish expresses anger that Sugar used her own servants to make the toys, and Gladius reflects with annoyance that Sugar was defeated once again. Meanwhile, Sugar's servants crowd around her, shocked to see her knocked out again. The servants who Sugar turned into toys talk about how they were worried they would be toys forever, but Gladius reassures them that they would have been turned back, though he knows that that would have been impossible.
On the fourth level of the palace, Luffy sees an injured Bellamy lying on the ground and expresses his worry, amusing Doflamingo who knew that the two used to be enemies. Luffy states that that was all in the past, and tells Doflamingo to let go of Bellamy. Doflamingo replies, saying Bellamy came to him with a death wish and that this was the way he deals with things, as Luffy remembers Bellamy's total devotion to Doflamingo. Doflamingo tells Bellamy that the latter was always a failure, and failure would be punished by death. Luffy replies angrily that Bellamy had changed and uses his powers to strike Doflamingo with his foot, despite Law warning against it. However, Doflamingo uses Bellamy to shield him from Luffy's kick, and Luffy kicks Bellamy in the face, much to the former's shock.
Luffy hastily apologizes for injuring Bellamy, and Law yells at him to control his anger, otherwise he would fall into Doflamingo's hands. Law states that for Luffy to lose control of his emotions would be the same as losing his life, as the same thing happened to him, and he calls Doflamingo a heartless man. Suddenly, Trebol breaks out in laughter over Luffy kicking Bellamy, making Luffy angrier. Doflamingo replies to Law's accusation, saying he is not heartless but rather has reached his boiling point due to Luffy and Law destroying his SAD Factory, killing Monet and Vergo, kidnapping Caesar Clown, freeing all the toys, and trying to destroy the SMILE Factory. Now that Luffy and Law are also trying to take his head, Doflamingo says that things have gone overboard, both in their actions and his anger. Doflamingo states that his anger is where it was 13 years ago, and Law states that he would not have been here if it were not for that event, and Doflamingo says that if it had not happened, Law would have been the third Corazon and have been right at his side.
Suddenly Doflamingo uses the move ""Black Knight"" to make another string clone of himself, which then attacks Law. Luffy then resolves to go after the real Doflamingo, when suddenly Bellamy attacks him with two swords. Luffy is confused and shocked at what the pirate is doing, but Law knows that Doflamingo is using his powers to control Bellamy. A weeping Bellamy apologizes to Luffy for what he is doing and tells Straw Hat to stop him.
All across Dressrosa the Coliseum fighters continue fighting the officers and soldiers while neither is gaining any advantage against one another.
Doflamingo also goads Luffy in that direction, but Luffy refuses, saying again that Bellamy is his friend. Doflamingo laughs about how even a single punch could kill Bellamy in his condition, and alludes to what Law had previously stated to Tashigi - the weak cannot choose how they die.
Luffy gets more angry that Doflamingo is not even bothering to fight them himself, and tells Law he is abandoning their plan. Law angrily berates him, and is angrier to see Luffy preparing an attack in his direction. Trebol laughs that Luffy is betraying his comrade, when Law suddenly activates Room, and switches his position with Doflamingo. By the time Doflamingo realizes Law's plan, it was too late, as Luffy hits him in the midsection with Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk.
Seeing his master attacked, Trebol desperately calls his name. Now sitting at Doflamingo's throne, Law looked up towards Trebol, before rolling upward and sliced him apart using a technique called Radio Knife.

Trebol is having difficulty reforming himself after being cut to pieces by Law. Before Law can attack him again, Doflamingo stops and brutally skewers Law with strings. Luffy tries to fight, but Doflamingo overcomes him and binds him, leaving him at the mercy of the controlled Bellamy. Doflamingo tells them that he hates people looking down on him and reveals his family's past, of how his father made the family leave the life of luxury and how his mother died of illness because of their fallen status. Doflamingo held his father with disdain and killed him, hoping to return to the life of a World Noble but was rejected by them, leaving him to swear to destroy the entire world ruled by them.","At the King's palace, Doflamingo is seen recovering from Luffy's Red Hawk to which he spits blood out. Law tells Luffy that all the damage they've managed to inflict are superficial wounds, stating that the strategy they used won't work a second time.
In Dressrosa Koala finds Sabo and sees if he's alright. Sabo says he is while Koala scolds him for not maintaining his position stating he should not be fighting an Admiral just because of his emotions. She says he could put the Revolutionary Army at war with them but Sabo retorts stating all that mattered to him was saving Luffy. Koala then violently pinches his cheeks and continues scolding him. Sabo then recalls his talk with Fujitora as the Admiral states that the Marines in this country cannot become heroes. When Sabo asks what others will think of his opinion and he states then he'll use the excuse of having been compromised. Sabo says that's a gamble, adding that he hopes the admiral has good luck. Back in the present, Sabo, who hasn't been paying attention to Koala continues to be pinched by her while she shouts that Hack and herself are always the ones that suffer in his place when people are annoyed by his selfishness.
At Usopp's location, the citizens begin to take Usopp and the others to Doflamingo's location to lure out the other criminals, when pirates show up and start killing off civilians to get the bounty on their heads. Despite the civilians trying to reason with them, the pirates continue killing them as Riku steps in and fights them. He releases Hack and Tank as they fight off the pirates and save the civilians. Seeing this, they all release Usopp and the others much to their confusion. They go on to state that by just manipulating Doldo for one night 10 years ago Doflamingo was able to turn the whole country against him and his bloodline. They state that after realizing the truth they just want to be saved from Doflamingo's cruel game. They go on stating that they were confused and don't know what to do, begging their former king to help them. The citizens then bow before Doldo stating if he wants them to fight they will do so. Doldo asks them to wait a little longer as he realizes he too is placing his faith in Luffy. At that moment, Fujitora shows up much to the surprise (and horror) of the Straw Hats. He states that he too will not allow Dressrosa to go to war. He then tells Doldo that he would be joining him in placing his bet on Luffy.
Back at the plateau, Luffy continues fighting Doflamingo as Trebol tries to put himself together as he states he knows everything about Law's ability and that they originally wanted the Ope Ope no Mi for themselves. However, he can't reform himself like usual. Law reveals ""Radio Knife"" is something that creates a different incision than a normal amputation and that for a few minutes he won't be able to reattach his body. Law rushes at Trebol using a move called ""Injection Shot"" as Trebol tries to reason with Law stating he helped take care of him. Trebol uses ""Snot Sword"" but Law dodges and charges, but Doflamingo kicks Law's attack away. Doflamingo aims an attack as Trebol grabs Law's legs as Doflamingo uses ""Full Bright"" that pierces Law from above. Luffy notices this and tries to help but Doflamingo rushes over to kick him. Luffy hardens his arm with Busoshoku Haki but Doflamingo does the same to his leg and it overpowers Luffy. Doflamingo then uses his powers to tie Luffy's hands behind his back and has Bellamy slash Luffy with a sword.
As the duo lay incapacitated Doflamingo tells Law how he hates being looked down upon. He goes on calling them scum and that the fact that they actually thought they could defeat him was ludicrous, going on to reveal the sacred bloodline of his heritage as a World Noble. As Luffy and Bellamy react shocked by this revelation (Law already discovered beforehand back in Green Bit), Doflamingo states his father abandoned all of his former riches and privileges and took him and all his family to a garbage dump of a world. Labeling his father's wish to ""live like real humans"" as nonsense and foolish, Doflamingo ridicules his father and states how much he hated him. He then recalls himself as a child asking his father where the slaves are and wants to buy some. He then tells his father commoners refuse to bow to him, and that they are even hunting down the family. A scene of his mother dying is shown as the the rest of the family heard angry commoners shouting for the Celestial Dragon family. Back in the present Doflamingo states by the time he was 10 he saw the heaven and hell of the world and later killed him and took his head back to Mary Geoise to reclaim his heritage. However, the Celestial Dragons labeled them as a ""family of traitors"" and refused to accept him as one ever again. Doflamingo then swore he would destroy every part of the world they rule.

Doflamingo explains that he learned of a national treasure that the World Nobles would not want revealed and used the knowledge to blackmail them into granting him their power. He also reveals the full potential of Law's Ope Ope no Mi with its power to give eternal life at the cost of the user's own life, but Law is not interested in using it and states that it was thanks to Corazon that he has the power to defeat Doflamingo.
Law then remembers his time in the Donquixote Pirates 16 years ago when he discovered that he had little over three years to live, which fueled his desire to destroy everything. He was part of the new recruits that recently joined the crew and met Corazon, a clumsy but talented officer of Doflamingo's crew. Law also learned the hard way that Corazon hates children when he was thrown out the window.","At the north-west town of Dressrosa, Primula, the Marines are trying to stop the panicking animals that are rushing against Doflamingo's Birdcage, resulting in their big wounds.

Law manages to stand back up on his feet. As the real Doflamingo prepares to kill him, Law questions Doflamingo about his fallen status and yet still have the ability to mobilize CP0. Doflamingo reveals that he knows about ""Mary Geoise's national treasure"", which will shake the world if its existence is revealed to the public. Therefore he can't be killed by the World Nobles, who had ceaselessly desired his death, in the end, he managed to use his knowledge to blackmail them and gain their cooperation.
The heavenly demon soon laments about the power of the Ope Ope no Mi that he should've had taken back then, and adds that if he owns it, he'll have the power to control the Mary Geoise National Treasure and take over the world. He further comments about the strength of the Ope Ope no Mi, which is able to transplant personality, and asking Law what its true power is, claiming that it is capable to fulfill mankind's greatest dream, thus making it known as the ""Ultimate Devil Fruit"". Law replies that he knows about it, but isn't interested about it, revealing its strongest power is to grant eternal life with the ""Ageless Surgery"", which upon use, will also kill the user of the Ope Ope no Mi. Doflamingo shouts that he never wanted Law to actually have it and attacks him, reminding Law of the many teachings he accepted in the past from Diamante, Lao G, and Gladius. Law soon claims that the reason he is there is because of Corazon, and that thanks to him, he'll be able to take on Doflamingo right now.
While they continue fighting, Law has a flashback to 16 years ago, at the port town of Spider Miles, somewhere in North Blue. Younger Diamante and Trebol are speaking to a child Trafalgar Law, who says that he is going to die in three years and two months, as said by his dead parents, and thus wants to kill and ruin everything as much as he can. Diamante replies that Law is a crazy kid and says that a lot of kids who ""try out"" for the crew always end up running away crying after two days, and revealing that Baby 5 and Buffalo, who appear from outside the building they're in and saying that Corazon is back, are the only children left. Corazon enters the room and slips onto the ground thanks to a prank pulled by young Baby 5 and Buffalo, both who laughed at his clumsy fall. He gets upset and hits the two kids. However, Baby 5 soon after offers him some tea that is actually boiling hot, which makes Corazon spit the tea out and fall backwards again. As Baby 5 laughs at him, she seems to start cleaning the mess. Diamante then comments about Corazon being stupid and possessing no concentration but claiming he has talent and lost his ability to speak due to a traumatic incident from long ago.

Episode 701,Sad Memories - Law the Boy from the White City!,12-Jul-15,The history of Flevance is revealed as Law's history prior to joining the Donquixote Pirates is explored.,"In the town of Spider Miles in the North Blue, a 10-year old Law sits alone in a trash dump and is told it is time to eat. Seeing Corazon walking along, Law stomps on one of his cigarette butts and curses him before being interrupted by Senor Pink, who tells him that Donquixote Doflamingo wants to ask him something. However, as Law claims he also has something to say, Corazon picks him up and throws him into the trash heap again before walking away. Seeing this, Senor Pink notes that Corazon has no mercy as Law swears to kill him.
At dinner, the Donquixote Family sits around a table and eats as Doflamingo reveals that their next target is Rakesh, which has been allying with other groups. When Law walks in, Giolla is hostile towards him, only for Doflamingo to reveal he called Law, shocking his crew members. Laughing, Trebol asks Law if he wants to leave after a week of being beaten by Corazon as Diamante notes that they only have the best because both kids and adults run away from them. He wonders how much longer Law will last, prompting Law to proclaim that he is not going anywhere. Lao G tells Law to never forget the Blood Law no matter how he is harmed because the Family will fall apart if a member defies the authority of the executives. Buffalo reveals that he once nearly died from torture after laughing at Pica's voice as Law claims it does not scare him because he has already seen hell.
Laughing at this, Doflamingo states that he will put to death anyone who attacks Corazon because the latter is his biological brother. When a shocked Machvise points out a white patch of skin on Law's chest, Giolla recognizes it as Amber Lead Syndrome, which causes agonizing pain to those infected. This prompts Buffalo to believe it is contagious while telling Law to leave. However, Doflamingo angrily tells Giolla to not spread rumors as facts before explaining how Amber Lead Syndrome is caused by poisoning and is not contagious. While Buffalo is still nervous around Law, Doflamingo asks Law if there are any other survivors of Flevance, only for Law to admit he does not know because he was desperate to get out. When asked how he escaped, Law reveals that he hid under a mountain of corpses. Doflamingo asks Law what he holds a grudge against, prompting Law to claim he wants to destroy everything and is not afraid of death before telling Corazon that he will get his revenge at any cost. Baby 5 berates Law for saying this despite the punishment he will receive, but Law merely glares at her, resulting in her clinging to Buffalo while crying.
The following day, in Rakesh, Gladius blows down the door to a pirate hideout before walking in with Giolla, Lao G, Baby 5, Senor Pink, and Machvise. The two groups enter a firefight as the Donquixote Pirates use their various Devil Fruit powers to overwhelm their enemies. With all the enemy pirates defeated, the Donquixote Pirates begin collecting the money present as Baby 5 asks Gladius what the city Law is from is like. Gladius reveals that it is called Flevance and that it was completely white. The citizens eventually discovered a type of lead called Amber Lead underground and they used the lead to create many different types of goods that people everywhere wanted to buy. This made it their primary business, and the World Government quickly took advantage of it by helping Flevance ship their goods.
In the past, Law studied with his father, only to be interrupted by his sister Lami asking him to come to the festival with her. When Law refused, his mother told him that too much studying is not good for him, only to be surprised when Lami asked her to come as well. Law's father said the three of them should all go, and after his mother agreed to go for only thirty minutes, Law agreed to go.
In the present, Lao G notes that everyone wanted to go to Flevance. When Baby 5 states that she wants to go there as well, Lao G reveals that it is long gone, shocking her. The Donquixote Pirates walk away from the hideout while being fired upon as Lao G and Gladius explain that the World Government performed a geological survey 100 years ago. It revealed that Amber Lead was poisonous and would erode the body if dug up and handled. However, the World Government and the royalty of Flevance kept this a secret because of the fortune that Amber Lead would bring them, so the citizens kept digging it up. As Gladius fires at the pirates attacking them, he explains that the traces and effects of Amber Lead would build up in each generation, consequentially shortening their lifespan by about 20 more years each, which meant that a generation doomed to die before adulthood was eventually born. Senor Pink joins the other crew members in walking as Gladius notes the world discovered the poisonous effects of Amber Lead too late.
In the past, Lami and Law's mother rushed toward the parade taking place as Lami told Law to hurry up. However, as Lami ran, she suddenly stopped and clutched her chest as Law noticed a white patch of skin on her arm. Around that time, all people eventually began to collapse at the same time due to the buildup of Amber Lead in their bodies. They began to die with immense pain flooding their bodies, which no doctor could stop. Law's father saw Lami's white patch of skin and began to cry as Law and his mother watched.
In the present, Baby 5 asks Gladius if everyone in Flevance died, only for Senor Pink to claim the real tragedy began after this event. He explains that the citizens of the surrounding countries placed a quarantine on Flevance because they thought Amber Lead Disease was contagious. The royalty escaped the country early with the help of the World Government, abandoning the ordinary citizens in the process, and anyone who attempted to escape while seeking treatment was shot dead like monsters escaping from a cage. Senor Pink notes that the manner in which the disease was treated as someone else's problem was very human-like before stating that Flevance would not remain quiet and had plenty of lead bullets, which eventually lead to a war breaking out. The Donquixote Pirates continue gunning down their foes as Senor Pink explains how the countries neighboring Flevance showed no mercy toward their attackers because they justified their assault as self-defense.
In the past, Flevance and its citizens were attacked as soldiers gunned down anyone they found. A nun informed Law that some soldiers promised to let only the children escape, only for Law to state that he cannot leave because his sister was dying. Noting this, the nun promised to come back on the next ship to get Law as the other children told Law to come with them. Law began to tremble, but the nun told him that there is always hope and that a loving hand will one day reach out to him, causing Law to smile. Later, Law's father attempted to plead with other doctors to come and help, trying to tell them the truth about Amber Lead, but was unsuccessful.
Elsewhere, Law stood next to his bedridden sister, whose body hurt and was turning whiter every day. In response, Law held her hand and promised that their father will find a cure. As soldiers gunned down civilians outside, Lami asked Law why it was so noisy, prompting Law to lie about there being a festival going on. Soon, soldiers entered the hospital with orders to kill any Amber Lead patients they find, prompting Law to have Lami hide in a closet before sneaking past two soldiers. However, Law found his mother and father shot to death and screamed in grief, alerting the soldiers to his presence. Leaping through a window as the soldiers fired at him, Law landed outside and ran away in tears as the soldiers pursued him. Eventually, Law escaped his pursuers by hiding under a bridge, and returned to find the children and nun lying dead outside, causing him to fall to his knees in tears while remembering the nun's words about hope. Upon returning to the hospital, Law found it burning and, realizing Lami has died as well, suffered a complete mental breakdown while screaming her name.
In the present, Senor Pink reveals that Flevance perished as the Donquixote Pirates finish off the pirates whom they were fighting. As Senor Pink notes that any 10-year old who experienced this would have their personality screwed up, Law walks through the garbage dump in Spider Miles until he sees Corazon reading a newspaper. Law notes that everyone he loved died while Corazon lived, claiming it is not fair. Hefting a dagger, Law says that no one will know if he keeps quiet about it and that no one will care if a scumbag goes missing before lunging toward Corazon and stabbing him in the back. Seeing this, Buffalo exclaims that Law broke the Blood Law and that he must inform Doflamingo.","Trafalgar D.

Episode 702,A Celestial Dragon! Doffy's Stormy Past,19-Jul-15,"Donquixote Doflamingo has a nightmare of his traumatic past and is extended after he wakes up. A flashback details the moment his parents left Mary Geoise, to when they became hunted, and the death of Doflamingo and Rosinante's mother. Law is inducted into the crew and is trained by them. Law reveals his full name to Buffalo and Baby 5, only to be taken away by Corazon (who could actually speak), who warns him to stay away from his brother. ","In Spider Miles, as Donquixote Doflamingo sleeps, he starts dreaming about his past. Hearing the voices of people talking about how they should kill the Donquixote Family because they are former World Nobles who will not be saved by the Marines, Doflamingo begins to sweat and grind his teeth in agitation.
In the past, Doflamingo, Rosinante, and Homing were hung from the windows of their burning house by ropes around their arms and were blindfolded by a mob commoners, who desired revenge for the suffering the Celestial Dragons had inflicted on them. The commoners debated how they should kill the Donquixotes, ranging from shooting them with a thousand arrows to breaking all their bones with a hammer, but one of them told the others to keep them alive so they could suffer. The citizens recount the sufferings caused by the World Nobles, who had hurt them, their relatives, and their countries whenever they felt like it. A man with a bow and arrow stepped up and took aim at Doflamingo while demanding to know if they had ever been hungry before firing the arrow at Doflamingo to see if it would hurt him. Though the arrow barely missed him, Doflamingo screamed in terror as the man demanded to know if the Celestial Dragons had ever felt any kind of pain before firing once more.
Doflamingo jolts awake in a cold sweat and begins to pant as the Den Den Mushi in his room rings. After putting on his sunglasses and drinking alcohol, Doflamingo picks up the receiver and is informed that Law did something.
Seventeen years ago in Mary Geoise, several World Nobles expressed their shock at Homing and his family giving up their status to become normal humans. This prompted Homing to claim he had been a human ever since he was born, causing one of the World Nobles to believe Homing implied they were human as well and become offended. However, Homing stated that he did not care what they thought because he thought humans are wonderful, which further shocked the other World Nobles. The Donquixote Family was ordered to leave Mary Geoise immediately.
Soon after, a World Government ship took the Donquixote Family to a non-member island in the North Blue. After being informed that an adequate house and assets have been prepared for him and his family, Homing thanked the government official before handing over his and his family's World Noble identification chips. After they arrived at their new house with their belongings, Homing told his family that they would lead a humble life here. Inside, Doflamingo asked his father where their slaves were as Rosinante rummaged through a chest full of treasure, only for Homing to reveal that they had to educate Doflamingo and Rosinante from scratch.
After Doflamingo changed into normal clothes, his mother claimed he looked wonderful, but Doflamingo tore off his tie in anger while claiming that he did not want to wear clothes that made him look like a slave. Preventing Doflamingo from tearing off his shirt, Homing informed him that they would be living as humans from now on, to Doflamingo's confusion, and that their life would be richer than it was in Mary Geoise because they would have heart instead of many material things.
Later, Homing and Doflamingo went to a marketplace, where Homing tried to buy some food. When the vendor noted that he did not look familiar, Homing revealed that he recently moved from Mary Geoise, which caused the vendor and those nearby to gasp in shock. A man asked Homing if he was a World Noble, but Homing explained how he had cast this title aside and they wished to become friends with the townspeople. Soon after, Doflamingo berated people crossing the street for not kneeling before him and demanded that someone give him a gun. That night, the commoners found the Donquixote Family's house and burned their home to the ground while searching for them. The Donquixote Family watched in terror from the forest nearby as Doflamingo asked his father why the commoners did not kneel before them. As searchers ran out of the burning building to report that the family was not inside, the angry mob agreed to make them experience several centuries' worth of suffering.
The Donquixote Family was forced to flee through the forest in the rain as the angry mob pursued them. While running, Doflamingo tripped and wondered why the commoners were coming after them. Eventually, the family found a run-down shack in a garbage dump, where they took shelter from the mob. Homing suggested that they stay here for a while, but Doflamingo voiced his disapproval because he could not stand the smell and bugs. Eventually, dawn broke, and while the family was sleeping, the angry mob came across the dump and began shouting to one another, which woke them. Seeing the commoners approaching with weapons, Homing told his family that they had to run immediately.
Eventually, the family found shelter in a small village, and Homing contacted the World Nobles, whom he begged to accept his wife and children back into Mary Geoise because he did not expect things would be this bad. However, the World Nobles refused to do so because the family could not take back their privileges and told Homing to never call them again because he was just a human. Soon after, Doflamingo and Rosinante were caught stealing bread and were badly beaten as punishment. Doflamingo told his father that he felt pain and hunger for the first time in his life. Doflamingo and Rosinante later ate from a garbage pile before bringing their mother some food, only to find she was sick. Eventually, she died, leaving Rosinante crying over her body as Doflamingo blamed Homing for her death. Not long afterward, the angry mob found the family, leading Homing to beg them to take him and pardon his sons as Doflamingo cursed his father for bringing them to ruin.
In the present, Giolla and Machvise bring Law to Doflamingo as Giolla reveals that they found him trying to escape. As Buffalo and Baby 5 watch, with Buffalo noting that they will torture Law for stabbing Corazon, Law notices Corazon is present and wonders if he will die for nothing after bribing Buffalo with ice cream to stay quiet. However, Doflamingo reveals that he has called Law here to welcome him to the Donquixote Pirates, shocking Law, Baby 5, and Buffalo. Doflamingo explains how Law has a certain quality in his eyes after experiencing such a horrible past, while Law wonders why Corazon has not yet told Doflamingo what happened. When Law points out that he is going to die in three years regardless of his potential, Doflamingo claims that this depends on his luck before explaining how the Donquixote Pirates specialize the black market and handle Devil Fruits, which means there could be a fruit that can cure his Amber Lead poisoning. Doflamingo states that there may be such a fruit among the Devil Fruits they handle in the next three years before revealing that he will train Law to become his right-hand man in ten years.
Corazon begins coughing and reveals the wound on his abdomen, prompting Doflamingo to ask him what happened. However, Corazon communicates that an enemy caused it and he finished him off, prompting Doflamingo to tell him to get his wound treated as a shocked Law wonders if Corazon covered up for him. Later, Doflamingo informs his crew that they will be moving their base toward Reverse Mountain while expanding their business. As they were moving across the sea, the pirates engaged in combat with the Marines and pulled bank heists. At one point, Law and Baby 5 were attacked by a pirate named Wellington, whom they were saved from by Doflamingo and his executives. Law began studying under Doflamingo, training with firearms under Gladius, learning martial arts with Lao G, and practicing swordsmanship with Diamante.
Two years later, Baby 5 and Buffalo tell Law their real names, but he initially refuses to tell them his. When Baby 5 complains that he is no fun, Law points out that he will die regardless of whether or not he has fun before noting that he may die sooner than he predicted. However, Buffalo claims that he will tell Doflamingo of Law stabbing Corazon two years ago if he does not reveal his true name, prompting Law to reveal his full name is Trafalgar D. Water Law, which alerts Corazon. Law admits that he should not be telling them this because his family has kept the initial D. a secret for many generations, and is irritated when Baby 5 and Buffalo complain about this not being interesting. However, Law is suddenly grabbed by the collar and hauled away by Corazon. After being thrown into an alley, Law confronts Corazon, but Corazon asks him if what he said before is true. Not knowing who is speaking, a surprised Law demands to find out. Corazon then faces Law and tells him to get away because he should not be around Doflamingo with the initial D. in his name.","Donquixote Doflamingo, Donquixote Homing (flashback), Donquixote Rosinante, Pandaman (flashback), Trafalgar D.

Episode 703,A Rocky Road - Law and Corazon's Journey of Life,2-Aug-15,"Corazon talks to Law about the name ""D."" and states that they are considered troublesome by most. He also tells Law about his ulterior motives without exposing his relation to the marines. Law threatens Corazon stating that he will tell Doflamingo about his motives and that he could talk. However, Law then changes his mind. As a result, Rosinante takes Law to multiple hospitals in a attempt to save him from the his disease but all the attempts fail.  ","Law stands frozen as he tries to comprehend the fact that Corazon can talk. Corazon says that he was always able to talk, and Law asks him why he kept it a secret from Doflamingo. Corazon replies that he never told Doflamingo he was a mute, although Law shouts that that is the same as trickery. Law's shouting causes some of the citizens to notice him and Corazon in the alley, so Corazon creates a circular barrier around them. Law realizes in shock that he can no longer hear anyone around them, and Corazon says that he put up a soundproof wall and no one can hear them now either. Corazon reveals that he ate the Nagi Nagi no Mi and became a soundless human, which shocks Law even further and leads him to ask if everything Corazon did was an act, which he affirms, despite accidentally lighting his shoulder on fire immediately afterwards.
After Corazon admits that he has always been clumsy, he tells Law that he never considered the other Donquixote Pirates friends. His goal was to stop his older brother Doflamingo from going out of control, as Doflamingo was a monster. Corazon remembers when he, Doflamingo, and Homing were lynched. He had begged for the mob to end his life while Homing had begged the mob to spare his sons and kill him instead. However, Doflamingo did not beg, but rather swore to stay alive and take revenge on the mob, shocking everyone present. In the present, Corazon tells Law that Doflamingo was born to be evil and the only ones who knew about his true brutality are him, the other three executives, and Vergo, who is away on a top-secret mission that only Doflamingo knows about.
Corazon tells Law to run away before he becomes like Doflamingo, but Law retorts that he wants to be like that. At that moment, Buffalo and Baby 5 peek at the two and are confused to see their lips moving with no sound coming out. Corazon then tells Law that his initial ""D."" means he is from the fated Family of D. Back in Mary Geoise, children were disciplined by being told that ""D."" would eat them. Corazon explains how notorious the D. initial and the people who carried it were, saying that in some places D's were known as ""God's Natural Enemy"". Corazon says that the World Nobles were often considered gods, and that the D's would destroy their world.
After taking in the information, Law becomes angry again and said he only joined the Donquixote Pirates to kill people violently and that he would die in a year without doing anything else. Corazon tells him to go find a cure, but Law says there is none before running to tell Doflamingo about Corazon's trickery. Corazon angrily chases after him and attacks him, but Law uses his newfound battle skills to throw Corazon in a dumpster. Law meets up with Buffalo and Baby 5, and Buffalo berates him for breaking the Blood Law again, but Law bribes him to keep quiet again. Later, Corazon emerges from the alley cursing that he told Law everything and preparing to pack his stuff before Doflamingo returns and leave. However, to his shock he encounters Doflamingo on their ship, and Doflamingo tells him that Tsuru's ship was after them and they needed to leave. Law then approaches a dumbfounded Corazon and tells him he decided to not tell Doflamingo to repay Corazon for not telling Doflamingo about the stabbing two years ago.
Later, the Donquixote Pirates are back out to sea being chased by Tsuru's ship. Suddenly, Diamante realizes that Corazon and Law are gone, and Senor Pink pulls out a note from Corazon that says he has gone to cure Law's illness. Meanwhile, Corazon sails away on a dinghy with Law tied up at the front. The young pirate is kicking and screaming to go back when suddenly the Den Den Mushi rings. Corazon picks it up and tells the person on the other end that he is taking a break from his mission for a while. The person on the other end is Sengoku, and he asks Corazon about the three kids who had not left the Donquixote Pirates before entrusting Corazon to continue his mission after his break and hanging up. Sengoku is then approached by two Marines, one of whom, Vergo, is requesting to transfer to the G-5 Branch. Law is suspicious about the exchange and asks Corazon if he is with the Marines, which he denies.
Corazon drags Law to a hospital, promising to take him to every hospital until his Amber Lead Syndrome is cured. Corazon is very hopeful about this hospital, but upon hearing of Law's condition and where he is from, the doctors back away in fear and activate a state of emergency. Feeling the pain of his past, Law runs out of the hospital, and Corazon regrets having to bring Law's memories of Flevance back before beating up the doctors and causing an explosion in the hospital. They visit several more hospitals, with the exact same results, and Law's condition only grows worse. Six months later, Corazon and Law camp out near the ocean. A drunk Corazon stands over Law, who he thinks is asleep, and expresses his regret that Law has to relive the pain he felt in Flevance. Corazon begins crying and states that the pain felt when Law stabbed him was nothing compared to the pain Law must be feeling before walking off. Law, however, was awake and heard everything, and begins crying as well. The next morning, Law wakes Corazon up for breakfast, calling him ""Cora-san"" to his astonishment.
Back in the present, Law presses on his attack on Doflamingo as he swears to himself never to forget the tears Corazon had that night. Inside the palace, Luffy continues dodging Bellamy's strikes when he realizes the Doflamingo clone is behind him. The Doflamingo clone flies toward Luffy as he screams out.","Trafalgar D.

He resolves to steal it himself in order to have Trafalgar D. Water Law cure himself. Three days before the fruit is scheduled to be traded to the Marines, Rosinante infiltrates the hideout of the Barrels Pirates and successfully steals the fruit, but is caught and attacked.","Under attack from Donquixote Doflamingo's string clone and a Parasite-controlled Bellamy, Luffy blocks the string clone's Goshikito with a Armament Haki-covered leg before being sent flying into a wall by a slash from Bellamy, only to get up and note the attack did not cut the strings binding his hands. Hearing a rumble from above, Luffy realizes Law is in trouble and decides to not remain any longer. When asked what he will do by the string clone, Luffy uses Gear Third to pump up both his forearms before coating them in Armament Haki and tearing apart the strings, to the surprise of the string clone, as he declares that it is his turn. Meanwhile, on the roof above, Law gets up while bleeding and glares at Doflamingo, who laughs, and Law recalls events from 13 years ago.
In the past, as a Den Den Mushi rings, Law tries to bring Corazon's attention to it, but Rosinante, enamored by Law calling him Cora-san, insists that he say it again. Eventually, Rosinante picks up the receiver and is greeted by his brother, Doflamingo. When asked if he is there, Rosinante taps the snail's back three times, prompting Doflamingo to note that it has been six months since Rosinante left with Law before asking if Law is there as well. Upon having this confirmed with another three taps, Doflamingo states that he is glad they are both okay and asks if Rosinante has found a good doctor, and when Rosinante confirms that he has not, Doflamingo admits that he thought as much before asking Rosinante to return to the ship with Law because they might be able to cure Law's disease. Upon hearing Law's audible shock, Doflamingo grins and reveals that they have received information about the Ope Ope no Mi: a group of pirates who are unaware of its true value will be selling it to the Marines for a huge sum of money. Noting that the World Government is likely pulling the strings on this, Doflamingo states that they will be seizing the fruit despite the risk doing so presents because he will be having Rosinante, his most trusted ally, eat it and cure Law's disease.
Hanging up on Rosinante, Doflamingo asks Trebol, Pica, and Diamante if they have noticed how the Marines, including their usual pursuer Tsuru, have not appeared near the Donquixote Pirates during the past six months that Rosinante has been gone. Diamante asks Doflamingo if he believes Rosinante had been tipping off the Marines before this and notes that it could just be a coincidence, prompting Doflamingo to claim that he hopes it is because Rosinante is his biological brother.
Meanwhile, Rosinante holds Law and spins him around while proclaiming that this is good news because they will be able to cure his disease without doctors if they can get the Ope Ope no Mi. When Law wonders what the Ope Ope no Mi is, Rosinante explains how it allows one to modify human bodies, perform miraculous operations, and cure unknown diseases, prompting Law to claim that he does not believe in magic like this. Rosinante clarifies that one needs medical knowledge in order to do all this and drops Law before pointing out how Law has been learning medical knowledge and techniques for a long time because he was the son of a respected doctor in Flevance, and when Law wonders what this has to do with the Ope Ope no Mi, Rosinante proclaims that Law is the perfect one to eat it. However, when Law states that Doflamingo wants him to eat it instead, Rosinante reveals that eating two Devil Fruits will cause a person to die and that Doflamingo does not know he is a Devil Fruit user. Stating that they will not be returning to the Donquixote Pirates, Rosinante explains how he decided this when he noticed their trip taking longer than he expected and states that Doflamingo probably knows he is a traitor by now. When Law says that it does not sound like this is true because Doflamingo wants him to eat the Ope Ope no Mi, Rosinante reveals that there is another reason that Doflamingo wants him to eat the fruit and thinks to himself that Doflamingo wants eternal life in exchange for his own life. Noting that he will get killed if he returns, Rosinante tells Law that they will surprise the Donquixote Pirate, get the Ope Ope no Mi, have Law eat it, and go into hiding somewhere, surprising Law.
Telling Law to make preparations for setting sail, Rosinante calls Admiral Sengoku. After Rosinante confirms his identity, Sengoku states that he had been worried because he had not heard from Rosinante from a while before telling Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp to leave, only for Garp to tell him to make him green tea because he just brought him senbei crackers. Recognizing Garp's voice, Rosinante asks Sengoku if now is not a good time, only for Sengoku to tell Garp to get out because he has to work. At the Marine Headquarters, Garp expresses his irritation at Sengoku treating him like a nuisance before asking Vice Admiral Kuzan if he wants to eat senbei crackers with him.
After being told that he can talk now, Rosinante asks Sengoku if the Marines have a deal regarding the Ope Ope no Mi, causing Sengoku to spit out his tea in shock. When Sengoku asks him how he knows, Rosinante reveals that Doflamingo knows, prompting Sengoku to claim that it is top secret. Law thinks about who Rosinante is talking to as Rosinante asks Sengoku what the Donquixote Pirates have been doing recently, and when Sengoku admits that they probably cannot track them down before the trade occurs, Rosinante reveals that Doflamingo is planning on stealing the fruit before the trade, surprising Sengoku even further. While watching Rosinante, Law's vision begins to blur as he becomes dizzy. When Rosinante asks him where the trade will occur, Sengoku reveals that it will be three weeks from now at Rubeck Island in North Blue. Rosinante decides to meet up with Doflamingo and his crew at Swallow Island three days before the trade, prompting Sengoku to realize that this means the Doflamingo Pirates will be waiting there before the trade and proclaim that the Marines will ambush and capture them there. When told to stay away from the island, Rosinante reveals that he was planning on doing so anyway before stating that he will give Sengoku the full list of Doflamingo's business associates and underworld contacts sometime soon before hanging up.
As he asks Law if he is ready to set sail, Rosinante sees Law has collapsed and frantically tries to wake him, only to discover that Law's condition has worsened. Claiming that it has not been three years yet and that Law should still have time left according to his calculations, Rosinante wonders what he should do before deciding to give Law some water, only to fumble while handing the cup to Law and almost fall off a cliff in the process. Rosinante tearfully asks Law what he should do before telling him to stay alive for another three weeks in order to give him a chance.
Three days before the trade is scheduled to occur, Rosinante sails through stormy seas with Law while wondering why the waves are so choppy. Speaking up, Law tells Rosinante that the World Government had the citizens of Flevance keep digging up the Amber Lead for the money it brought them despite knowing that they would die and states that the World Government killed his friends and family before asking Rosinante to tell him if he is a Marine soldier allied with them. Rosinante claims that he is not, which makes Law smile, before explaining how they will be making enemies of Doflamingo, the Marines, and the World Government by stealing the Ope Ope no Mi, which means that Law must be prepared to fight in order to live.
Later, while approaching Minion Island, Rosinante asks Sengoku if he has found the pirates, prompting Sengoku to explain how their hideout is located in a ghost town on Minion Island. When Sengoku mentions that Diez Barrels is the captain of the pirates, Rosinante notes that he is a former Marine officer as Sengoku states that their look-out ship is currently staking out the island. Rosinante notes that it is all as Sengoku said as Sengoku reveals there are two warships stationed at Swallow Island. Thinking to himself that no one can see the boat here, Rosinante anchors the boat to a tree and tells Law to wait here because he will not be gone long, but is surprising when he sees Law clinging to his coat. Soon after, Rosinante climbs up a rope to a nearby cliff with Law tied to his back.
In the Barrels Pirates's hideout, Barrels tells his son, X Drake, to bring them more booze before asking his crew members how much they think the Ope Ope no Mi costs with the World Government offering them 5,000,000,000 for it. While his crew members note that there is no reason for them to remain pirates with that much money, Barrels explains how a doctor who eats this fruits would become famous and reveals that there was once such a doctor who performed miraculous operations in order to cure seemingly incurable diseases. As Barrels claims this has nothing to do with them, Law emerges from one of the buildings in the town below to see Rosinante running toward the hideout while properly wearing his coat.
Law thinks back to how Rosinante once showed him some of the capabilities of the Nagi Nagi no Mi. Rosinante showed him Calm, which would cause anything he interacted with to not make any noise, and demonstrated it by breaking a vase, firing a cannon, and farting without making any noise. However, Law did not think this was useful or cool and told Rosinante that even Baby 5's Bukimorphosis was cooler than this, shocking Rosinante, who noted that at least no one else could have a quiet sleep like he could.
Sitting in the snow, Law is surprised to see an explosion occurring at the Barrels Pirates' hideout without any noise. At the hideout, Barrels wonders what just happened as one of his subordinates informs him that the compound just exploded without any noise and another reveals that the treasure house is on fire, prompting Barrels to order them to put out the fire. Having used Calm on himself, Rosinante shoots out the candles illuminating the room with no sound, causing the pirates to realize the lights are gone and that glass is falling on them, As Barrels tries to have someone put on a light, Rosinante kicks him in the side of the head, causing him to drop the Ope Ope no Mi. Rosinante picks up the Ope Ope no Mi and begins to silently run away as the pirates realize someone is here. Smashing through a window, Corazon runs away while tossing a grenade through the window into the hideout, causing another explosion.
As two pirates stationed outside see him running away, Rosinante begins to cry while mentally exclaiming that he got the fruit and Law's disease will be cured, only to slip on the snow and tumble into the midst of another group of pirates. As pursuing pirates inform them that a man in a black coat stole the Ope Ope no Mi, the pirates look at Rosinante and realize it is him before shooting him. Further away, Law recalls Rosinante saying that he could not take him along and telling him to wait here for a while before he returns with the Ope Ope no Mi, which caused Law to smile.","Bellamy, Monkey D.

The Donquixote Pirates arrive on Minion Island, and Doflamingo traps the remaining pirates in his Birdcage as Rosinante resolves to have Law survive this and remember his smile.","Vice Admiral Tsuru walks down the gangplank of her ship and looks toward Swallow Island, where the Donquixote Pirates and Donquixote Rosinante are set to rendezvous, before telling her subordinates to not let their guard down because they are dealing with Donquixote Doflamingo. As Tsuru wonders where Sengoku got the information to deploy them like this, one of her subordinates informs her that they were contacted by their lookout ship stationed at Minion Island. At the island, one of the Marines from the ship reveals to Tsuru that Diez Barrels's hideout is on fire and that they are currently investigating what happened. However, Tsuru reprimands them for risking getting caught before ordering them to inform her of any suspicious people they find in the coastal area.
Elsewhere, several members of the Barrels Pirates lie defeated around a bloody patch of snow as Rosinante walks away while carrying Trafalgar D. Water Law in his arms.
At the Barrels Pirates' hideout, the remaining pirates try to put out the fire as X Drake crashes through a window before running away. Inside the burning building, one of Barrels's subordinates attempts to help him, but Barrels throws him away and tells the others to not worry about his wounds before ordering them to retrieve the Ope Ope no Mi because a 5,000,000,000 deal is in jeopardy.
At the base of the mountain, Law opens his eyes to see Rosinante kneeling before him. After using Silent, Rosinante shows Law the Ope Ope no Mi as Law notes that he was worried about Rosinante because he saw that the building was on fire and heard some gunshots. However, Rosinante berates him because this is unimportant in comparison to the Ope Ope no Mi allowing Law to save his life. When Law claims that Rosinante does not know if the fruit will cure his disease, Rosinante proclaims that it will before forcing Law to eat it. After swallowing the fruit whole, Law looks at his hands and tells Rosinante that he was not ready for this, only for Rosinante to collapse in front of him. As Rosinante says he is glad Law can heal himself and that they have outsmarted Doflamingo, blood begins to trickle from his head as Law wonders if he is just tired. Upon seeing a pool of blood spreading out from Rosinante, a shocked Law flips him over to see that he has been injured multiple times.
When asked if he was shot, Rosinante admits that he made a small blunder, prompting Law to demand to know what he is doing before attempting to heal him with his newly-acquired powers. However, nothing happens, prompting Rosinante to laugh while noting that Devil Fruit abilities do not work like magic. Assuring Law that he did not get shot because of him, Rosinante claims that these wounds will not kill him and that he will try to staunch the bleeding before reminding Law that getting the Ope Ope no Mi will not stop Doflamingo from running wild. Rosinante apologizes for using Law when he is weakened before asking him to hand a small capsule over to the Marine lookout ship stationed on the island. Explaining how all Marine soldiers will recognize the capsule, Rosinante reveals that its contents will save a far-off kingdom known as Dressrosa. When Law begins to say that he hates the Marines, Rosinante grabs his hand and reminds him that he is the son of a doctor before stating that he will be able to save more than just sick people from now on. After Rosinante tells him that they will leave this island once he delivers this, Law agrees to deliver the capsule, prompting Rosinante to smile before promising that the two of them will travel around the world.
Soon after, Law trudges through the snow before hiding behind a wall upon seeing some Marines walking by. As his legs tremble, Law sees Vergo walking by himself and approaches him before asking him to take the capsule. Upon seeing the capsule, Vergo realizes it must be a secret letter that someone asked Law to deliver before promising to keep it. As Vergo notes that Law sounds very weak, Law asks him if he can be trusted before revealing that he needs him to help someone who has been shot and who should not die at any cost. Soon after, Vergo carries Law to Rosinante, whom Law tells that Vergo will be giving him first aid. However, upon seeing Vergo, Rosinante blurts out his name, prompting Vergo to ask him why he is here before realizing that he just spoke. As Rosinante realizes what Vergo's secret mission must be, Vergo lets Law drop from his back as Law remembers Rosinante telling him about Vergo six months ago.
As Vergo opens the capsule to look at the letter within, Rosinante realizes that his secret mission must have been infiltrating the Marines. Seeing Rosinante crawling toward him, Vergo states that he understands before kicking Rosinante through the wall behind him, prompting a shocked Law to call out to him before leaping onto Vergo and weakly punching him. When Law identifies him as the Vergo that Rosinante was telling him about, Vergo grabs him by the throat and lifts him into the air before deducing that Law is the boy from Flevance and stating that he heard the two of them had gone missing. Reprimanding Law for not referring to him as Vergo-san, Vergo throws him away before ripping up Rosinante's letter while admitting that the Donquixote Pirates would have been doomed if the Marines got their hands on this information. Vergo removes his cloak while asking Rosinante if Law is more important to him than his fellow pirates are before kicking him in the chest.
After removing his shirt and bandanna as well, Vergo coats his entire body in Armament Haki before punching Rosinante in the stomach while noting that Rosinante was already suspicious for disappearing at the age of 8 and coming back to the Donquixote Pirates 14 years later before stating that Doflamingo only trusted him because they were brothers. Vergo continues to brutally beat Rosinante as Law begs him to stop. Hearing this, Vergo stops hitting Rosinante and walks over to Law before punching him as well. Soon after, Law and Rosinante lie badly beaten on the ground as Vergo informs Doflamingo that they are still breathing. When asked what he knows, Vergo reveals that Rosinante was the Marine's spy and had been planning to frame Doflamingo. As some of the Barrels Pirates approach the Donquixote Pirates' ship, Doflamingo explains how he had been watching Swallow Island and saw two warships arrive, which convinced him of Rosinante's betrayal. As the other Donquixote Pirates defeat the Barrels Pirates, Doflamingo claims that his crewmates are the only family he has.
Doflamingo notes that they are too late because he heard Barrels's subordinates saying that the Ope Ope no Mi had been stolen before ordering Vergo to not let Rosinante escape with the fruit, only for Vergo to discover that Rosinante and Law have disappeared. However, Doflamingo states that them running does not matter as long as they are still in the town before creating a Birdcage, which spreads to cover the hideout while shocking the remaining Barrels Pirates. Elsewhere, Law wakes up and asks Rosinante where Vergo is before seeing the Birdcage and wondering what it is. Rosinante admits that he only knows it is one of Doflamingo's techniques before revealing that it means they have nowhere to run.
Several pirates are taken control of with Parasite and begin to attack each other as Rosinante notes this is like hell. When Law asks him what is happening before passing out, Rosinante walks over to him and recalls how their relationship has changed over the past 3 years before admitting that he will not survive this and can only hope Law makes it out alive. Wondering if Law will remember him when he is gone, Rosinante picks him up and uses Silent once more while deciding to go out with a smile so that is what Law remembers about him. As Rosinante tells him that they need to go, Law opens his eyes and screams upon seeing Rosinante's smiling face.","Tsuru, Hototogisu, Donquixote Rosinante, Trafalgar D.

After learning that Trafalgar D. Water Law has eaten the Ope Ope no Mi and being tricked into believing that he has already left the island, Doflamingo kills his brother and unknowingly has his crew transport a grieving Law to safety.","Inside the Birdcage surrounding the ghost town on Minion Island, the Barrels Pirates are running while being attacked by crewmates controlled by Doflamingo's strings. A shocked platoon of Marines stand outside and report what is going on while trying to break through the Birdcage, to no avail. Meanwhile, a boy named Dory has ended up outside the Birdcage, and three of his trapped crewmates beg him to help them. However, Dory runs away. Meanwhile, two pirates are shot dead by the Donquixote Pirates, and Barrels hears it from inside his headquarters. He curses Dory for abandoning them as he prepares for battle at the entrance. Suddenly, Doflamingo cuts apart the door and proceeds to slash Barrels, causing him to collapse. An angry Barrels asks Doflamingo if his crew stole the Ope Ope no Mi, but Doflamingo replies that if they did he would not have to go to this trouble. Doflamingo denounces Barrels for letting the Ope Ope no Mi get stolen as he pulls out his gun and shoots Barrels twice.
Outside, Diamante, Machvise, and Trebol pile up all the treasure they found and admire it. Lao G comes and tells them to stop fooling around and look for Corazon. Meanwhile, Buffalo flies over the cage with Baby 5 on his back. Lao G asks him how his search is going, and Buffalo reports that there are no survivors in sight. Suddenly, Baby 5 intercepts a Marine transmission revealing that the Marines have taken a boy into custody. Lao G shouts at them to start working to find Corazon. Diamante approaches Doflamingo, wondering if Corazon is already dead. As Doflamingo sits on Barrels' body, he holds his pistol in his hand and recalls when he first received it.
Thirty-one years ago, Doflamingo was approached by Trebol and Vergo after he used Supreme King Haki on some citizens. Later, Doflamingo stood behind his father Homing while carrying a pistol, as Homing restrained a crying Rosinante while Doflamingo asked him why he took their power away. Doflamingo remembered how Trebol gave him the strength to take revenge as he held the pistol at his father's head. Doflamingo told Homing that he would regain his World Noble status by taking Homing's head to Mary Geoise. Homing simply apologized to his sons for having to have a father like him, and Doflamingo struggles for a brief moment before finally pulling the trigger.
Meanwhile, Corazon hides behind a tree as the Donquixote Pirates search for him. He then sneaks up behind Gladius to get his attention, and Gladius shoots at Corazon. Pica goes to Doflamingo to report that they found Corazon. Elsewhere, Law sits inside a treasure chest, remembering how Corazon told him to stay there. Law then hears the Donquixote Pirates heading for Corazon, and he tries to open the chest, to no avail. Corazon taunts Gladius, who has been joined by Diamante and Machvise, and manages to avoid Gladius' shots. Diamante extends his sword to try to injure Corazon, managing to graze his jacket. Corazon runs toward a building when Lao G suddenly comes flying toward him, a punch at the ready. Corazon manages to avoid Lao G's attack, but he runs into Trebol, who launches explosive mucus balls at him to send him flying towards the building. Corazon slams into the wall and stands face to face with his four pursuers. He moves toward them, when he is suddenly grabbed by Pica, who merged into the stone wall.
Pica tightens his grip on Corazon before throwing him towards Diamante, who sends him flying with a bat. Corazon lands on the ground, facing his pursuers, and cracks a smile. However, Gladius kicks Corazon repeatedly, asking him angrily why he pretended to be mute and saying he made a fool of Doflamingo. Law hears the exchange in shock as Lao G warns Gladius not to kill Corazon before Doflamingo arrives. Trebol then grabs Corazon with his mucus and slams him into the treasure chest containing Law as Doflamingo arrives on the scene. As Doflamingo approaches him, Corazon lights a cigarette but starts succumbing to his injuries. Doflamingo reflects how it had been six months since he last saw Corazon with malice in his voice, but Corazon just smiles as Law worriedly hears the exchange.
Doflamingo and Corazon stare at each other as Corazon reaches into his jacket. Machvise and Gladius attempt to intervene, but Doflamingo stops them. Corazon remembers how Sengoku took him in after his father died as he pulls a gun out of his jacket and points it at Doflamingo. Corazon reveals to Doflamingo that he was a Marine Commander on an undercover mission to prevent a tragedy Doflamingo planned. Corazon then quietly apologizes to Law for lying to him, but Law says he knew it all along. Doflamingo becomes angry at Corazon and asks him where Law and the Ope Ope no Mi are. Corazon replies that he had Law eat it and that Law was already out of the cage and probably taken into Marine custody. Corazon's words are confirmed by Buffalo and Baby 5, who report they intercepted a message about a boy being taken in. Doflamingo is angered that they did not tell him sooner, and Corazon is shocked and relieved that that happened despite Law still being on the island. On the Marine ship, the Marines comfort a shivering Dory. Doflamingo then yells to check the ship and says he will undo the Birdcage, shocking Corazon even more about how much this coincidence was working in Law's favor.
Doflamingo prepares to head out and sink the Marine ship, but Corazon tells him not to. However, Doflamingo reveals that since Law ate the Ope Ope no Mi, he needed to teach Law the importance of dying for him. Doflamingo then pulls his pistol out of his jacket and asks Corazon why he is being forced to kill another member of his own family, knowing that Corazon could not shoot him due to being too much like Homing. Inside the chest, Law senses Corazon is in danger and attempts to get out, but remembers how Corazon put him in there, saying someone would take him out of the island. Law feared for Corazon's safety, but Corazon said Doflamingo was after the Ope Ope no Mi and would not harm him. Corazon used Calm to prevent Law from making a sound and then told Law he loved him before leaving. In the present, Corazon says that Law is finally out of Doflamingo's grasp and that he is not the same person as he was three years ago, having been freed from the Amber Lead disease and the stigma of Flevance. Doflamingo then shoots Corazon, and Law recalls his memories of Corazon as the man falls to the ground.
The Donquixote Pirates then prepare to leave the island, carrying Law's chest out with them. However, Corazon is still alive, and clings to life in order to keep Law from making a sound. The Donquixote Pirates are attacked on the coast by Tsuru, and they are forced to abandon the treasure as Law leaves, crying silently. As the Donquixote Pirates set sail and Law gets further from the chest, Corazon dies just as the Marine battleships start firing, drowning out the sound of Law's now audible cries.","X Drake, Donquixote Doflamingo, Diez Barrels, Pica, Diamante, Machvise, Trebol, Lao G, Buffalo, Baby 5, Vergo, Donquixote Homing, Donquixote Rosinante, Gladius, Trafalgar D.

Episode 707,To Be Free! Law's Injection Shot Blasts,30-Aug-15,"Law clashes with Doflamingo, and asks him what he thinks about Luffy and the Ds. Doflamingo dismisses the legends surrounding the name as mere superstition. Law then reveals to Doflamingo that he is a D. as well, leading Doflamingo to cause major damage to the palace roof.
Elsewhere, Viola keeps an eye on all the battles that are going on, most of which are causing a lot of injuries. In Kyros' battle against Diamante, Diamante causes the ground to shake, and Leo and Kabu are hot on the trail of Princess Mansherry. The Corrida Colosseum combatants have trouble fighting off the officers of the Donquixote Pirates.
Enraged at Law for being a D., Doflamingo gets up close to attack him. Too late, Law uses Injection Shot on him, piercing him through the midsection. Law states that he has come to pull the trigger that Corazon could not on that fateful day.","In the present as Law clashes with Doflamingo, he recalls Rosinante's declaration of Law's freedom to Doflamingo before the latter murders him. However he laments that will not be truly free until he accomplishes his goal of stopping Doflamingo's madness. Law creates a ""Room"" around them, and tosses a pebble behind Doflamingo. As he does so, he asks him what he thinks of Monkey D. Luffy, considering Law has now learned today that Doflamingo was a World Noble. He then uses ""Shambles"" to switch places with the rock, thus teleporting behind Doflamingo. He attempts to stab him through the back, while further inquiring what he thinks of D. Doflamingo however forms Haki over his hand and catches the blade. He states it is of no concern to Law, and pulls him forward to cut him with his strings. He then ridicules the idea that Luffy, as a D, was led there by fate to claim his head as a noble. Though disarmed, Law forms Haki over his hands and forearm to block Doflamingo's attack, while revealing that he too is a D. This infuriates Doflamingo, and the aftermath of his attack slices off the top of the palace.
Meanwhile, Luffy struggles against Doflamingo's Black Knight clone and a controlled Bellamy who continues to use the latter as a shield.
At the former Royal Plateau, King Riku asks Viola about the current status of the battle. Assessing that the longer the battle continues, the more injuries there will be, she indicates that the battle has three settings: the plateau holding the royal palace, the statue of Pica, and the SMILE Factory. Upon hearing this, Usopp asks Viola how many officers still remain. She states that they are disbursed as follows: Senor Pink is guarding the SMILE Factory. Pica is still atop his stone statue. On the top floor of the palace, are Doflamingo and Trebol. At the 4th level of the palace, is Diamante. On the third level, Gladius leads what remains of the soldiers. Finally, on Level 2, there are Lao G, Baby 5, Machvise, and Dellinger, whom we learn is a half fish-man of the fighting fish species.
Viola concludes that the many of the remaining fighters are heavily injured, and that the final moments of the battle are drawing near. At the SMILE Factory, Franky and Senor Pink are still battling intensely. Senor has saved a cat, much to the adoration of their female spectators. Roronoa Zoro is still locked in battle with Pica. At level three of the plateau, Cavendish is fending off Gladius while Robin uses her power to create a staircase out of legs. Cavendish goes on to remark that Gladius' minions' attacks are putting him to sleep. On level four of the plateau, Diamante begins an attack that makes the ground wave like a flag, much to the astonishment of Kyros and Rebecca. Inside the Royal Palace, Leo and Kabu are defeating Donquixote soldiers in the pursuit of saving Princess Mansherry. In front of the Royal Palace, Sabo is helping out some citizens, while Koala is running off to an unknown location. At level two of the palace, the Donquixote Family officers are defeating the Colosseum Army with relative ease. Back at the Former Royal Plateau, Viola has made it clear that if Doflamingo is not defeated, nothing will change. This leads some of the citizens to worry that the fate of their country is being left in the hands of pirates, as Admiral Fujitora watches on.
At the Royal Palace, Doflamingo, now upset at the revelation of Law's real name, is attacking him viciously. He ridicules Law for believing that fate has brought him there as well to defeat him. As he writes off Rosinante's words to Law about the ""D"" clan as superstition, Trebol warns him that he is now within range of Law's attack. However Doflamingo fails to take heed, and Law stabs him through the midsection with ""Injection Shot"". Upon this, Law tells Doflamingo that Rosinante knew fully that Law couldn't beat him by virtue of his secret name alone. He furthermore says that ""Cora-san"" was too kind to pull the trigger on Doflamingo, so he will do it himself.","Trafalgar D.

Meanwhile, Zoro and Pica continue fighting, with Pica continuing to get larger. Some of Pica's soldiers attempt to stop Zoro, but they are defeated by Orlumbus. Pica then inhabits the entire King's Plateau and laughs at Zoro, which causes the latter to make fun of him again. This causes Pica to get enraged and raise large spikes from the ground.
Luffy continues to struggle against Doflamingo's clone and Bellamy. Eventually, he gets by Bellamy and defeats the string clone, sending him back to Doflamingo and saving Law from getting killed.","Law is continuing his fight with Doflamingo, with him using Tact to throw part of the castle to Doflamingo, only to be blocked by Doflamingo's Kumo no Sugaki. Law then tries to launch another Shambles, but this time, Doflamingo grabbed his right hand and commented that he should not launch ineffective attacks at him. He states that if Law wanted him dead, he should have pitted him against Kaido and that there are millions of methods to kill someone stronger than yourself, rather than let his emotions get in the way. Law states that everything he's done and will do has been to avenge Corazon. Doflamingo then cuts off Law's right arm with Itonoko, and says while pulling out his gun that he will forgive Law the same way he forgave his father and brother, by killing them; and that the best method is to use a lead bullet.
Elsewhere in Dressrosa, Zoro continues his battle with Pica, who becomes a stone monster again and causes Zoro to lose his footing and fall back to the lower level before striking with his fist. As Zoro slashes the statue in half, the lower Donquixote members try to shoot at him, but Orlumbus shows up and tricks them into lining up before taking them out using ""Admiral Killer Bowling"". Zoro thanks Orlumbus, who states his name and leaves Pica to him while he and the others deal with the lower members. Just then, Pica merges with the plateau. When Pica laughs, a shocked Zoro comments on how stupid it is, causing Pica to use ""Charlestone"", attacking Zoro and his own men in the process while Zoro dodges.

Bellamy uses his Spring Hopper move and darts around the room. Bellamy states that it is not only Luffy who has become stronger, but his Spring Hopper has become so as well.
Meanwhile, Zoro continues his fight with Pica who continues to attack indiscriminately. Dellinger complains to Pica for almost hitting him as well, allowing Ideo to hit him while proclaiming that he shouldn't take his eye off his opponent.

Elsewhere, Machvise has finished his fight with Hajrudin and now sets his sights on Zoro. While Hajrudin lays defeated, he laments how he cannot repay his debts despite wanting to be the king of all giants, losing the tournament, being turned into a toy and later being saved. Admits his shame, Hajrudin wonders if this is all he's able to do to help his saviors. When Machvise uses his 1000 Ton Vice against Zoro, Hajrudin gets up and tells Zoro he will handle him. Surprised at Hajrudin being alive, Machvise decides to use his 10,000 Ton Hell Vise on him while shouting that Hajrudin still must have some bones to break on him. Noting that the dead are of no use to anyone and that he can defeat Machvise even if he only has one arm left, Hajrudin uses ""Gungnir"" against the officer.

When Sai tells her that he will not let her go until this is settled, Baby 5 interprets his words as a marriage proposal, to his shock. Nearby, Chinjao attacks Lao G, who effortlessly dodges his attacks before counterattacking with a flurry of blows. Blocking every strike as well, Chinjao hardens his fist with Armament Haki before punching Lao G, who blocks and remains in place in midair despite the force of the blow destroying a stone wall behind him. Lao G sends Chinjao flying with a kick before landing on one leg, which seemingly injures his back, to the surprise of those watching; however, Lao G adjusts his body to fit the Yotsu no Kamae stance, which the subordinates nearby identify. As Chinjao gets up and curses him, Lao G rushes toward him before using Me no Tsukare, which culminates in him unleashing a flurry of blows aimed at Chinjao's face that knock him back. After using Kata Kori to injure Chinjao's shoulder, Lao G strikes Chinjao in the stomach with Hie Sho and kicks his lower back with Gikkuri Goshi before striking all of his joints with Fushi Bushi no Itami, causing Chinjao to collapse as Lao G lands behind him.
As the observing pirates note that he is overpowering a pirate worth over 500,000,000, Lao G proclaims that this fighting style, Jio-Ken, is the result of him growing older and better understanding pain. However, as one of the pirates points out that Lao G is facing the wrong way because his opponent his behind him, Chinjao gets up and stares at Lao G before proclaiming that he will not support a marriage between Sai and Baby 5, shocking the observing pirates. When Sai angrily claims that he said he would not marry Baby 5, who is shocked, Chinjao reminds Sai that he is scheduled to marry the daughter of the Niho Navy's leader, prompting Sai to state that he does not care who he is married to and that Chinjao can do as he pleases. The observing pirates realize Lao G is being ignored and believe he will grow angry, but Lao G indicates that he did not hear what Chinjao and Sai said, to their shock. However, the pirates see what appears to be steam coming from Lao G's head and believe that he is getting mad, only to realize it is his spirit and that he is dying.
Lao G's spirit begins to ascend to heaven as the pirates claim that a battle should not end with a natural death like this. Seeing this, Baby 5 begs Lao G to come back, prompting his spirit to return to his body so he can ask Baby 5 what she said. Straightening up, Lao G mocks Chinjao by asking him if he got weaker, which seems to anger Chinjao, only for the latter to demand to know what Sai is doing. As Sai wonders what Chinjao means, Baby 5 adjusts his crooked collar for him, prompting a surprised Sai to demand to know if she is his wife before leaping back and telling her to stay away. When Sai asks her why she brought up marriage despite being his enemy, Baby 5 claims that he needs her before stating that she will do anything. Hearing this, Sai mockingly tells her to kill herself for him, shocking Baby 5.
Sai explains that they need to take care of the high-ranking Donquixote Pirates in order to repay their debt to Luffy, only to be surprised when Baby 5 actually turns her arm into a gun and places it against her head while stating she is happy to kill herself in order to help him. As Baby 5 says that she loves helping people more than anything else, Sai demands to know what she is doing and claims that he will feel bad if he wins through her killing herself. Chinjao demands to know why he is trying to prevent an enemy from ending their own life and claims he should be more ruthless as the leader of an army, but Sai angrily tells him to back off because Chinjao is no longer his master. Baby 5 closes her eyes as Sai runs toward her and thinks about how happy she is that she can be useful simply by killing herself.
In the past, a tribe in a desert area learns that one of their women gave birth to a child and orders the mother to abandon her on a mountain because she will simply consume their food without contributing anything. Soon after, the mother led the young Baby 5 to a secluded jungle area while her child asked her where they were going. Upon being shoved to the ground, Baby 5 ran after her mother and tearfully begged her to wait, only for the mother to tell her to not follow because she was useless to everyone. As the mother walked away, Baby 5 knelt on the ground while wondering if she was even useless to her mother before crying out in sadness. Later, as a young woman, Baby 5 subscribed to 50 newspapers after being asked to by several men because she was needed by them, and soon after accepted a marriage proposal from a homeless man because she believed she was needed by him.
In the present, Baby 5 notes that she is needed by someone now as Sai tells her to stop. However, an angered Chinjao claims Sai is foolish while leaping toward him and cutting off his advance toward Baby 5 before slicing through one of the stone spikes produced by Pica's Charlestone, which lands on the ground as Chinjao stands on its point. As Chinjao claims that they do not need disgraceful men like Sai in the Happo Navy, Sai continues to run toward Baby 5 and tells Chinjao to stay out of his problem, prompting Chinjao to coat his head in Armament Haki, which the observing pirates realize means he is preparing to use his ice continent-splitting technique. Proclaiming that he is going to smash both of them with his drill head, Chinjao leaps into the air before falling toward Sai and Baby 5 while using Hasshoken Ogi: Kiryu Kirikugi, only for Sai to respond by hitting Chinjao's head with Bujaogen, causing electricity to crackle around the two of them. As the top of the stone spike nearby is cut off by the force of the clash, Chinjao's drill-shaped head is bent 90 degrees at the middle.
Running toward Baby 5, Sai slaps her before berating her for trying to do something so foolish, surprising Baby 5. As Chinjao lies on the ground a few feet away, the stone spike that the three are on top of crumbles, causing them to fall to the ground below. Feeling the bruise on her face, Baby 5 asks Sai why he stopped her from trying to help him, prompting Sai to ask her if she has been living in a world where no one has told her how she is misunderstanding others. Meanwhile, Chinjao regains consciousness and feels his bent head as Sai expresses disbelief at having done this. Admitting that he is surprised at Sai having bent his head, Chinjao becomes teary-eyed while noting that this means Sai's power has revealed itself at last. Chinjao gets to his feet while telling a surprised Sai that his intense training has come to fruition and that the Hasshoken technique has been successfully passed on before proclaiming that Sai's kick will gain the name Hasshoken Ogi: Kiryu Kirikugi as well. As Sai notices his left foot being engulfed in a blue flame, Chinjao tells him that his kick should now be able to break open the ice continent as well and that the Happo Navy is his to command before revealing that he will cancel Sai's arranged marriage and leave him to do whatever he wishes.
Chinjao tearfully congratulates Sai before embracing him as Sai claims Chinjao is embarrassing him. Revealing that he has been experiencing chronic pain since his fight with Luffy and thus could not fight as well as he wished to, Chinjao admits that he is getting older before being interrupted by a much more muscular Lao G, who attacks him with G no Kokuin, sending Chinjao crashing into a wall far away. As Sai calls out to Chinjao, who falls to the ground, Lao reveals that this is the ultimate technique of Jio-Ken, Jioken Kyukyoku no Higi: Sento Ho-Ken, that allows the practitioner to draw on the power of their youth and use it in combination with their seasoned fighting skills. Lao G declares that no one can beat him now as Sai angrily states that he will not forgive him for attacking Chinjao.
As Lao G claims that Sai needs another hundred years of combat experience before being strong to challenge him, Sai proclaims that he will do this to avenge Chinjao and repay his debt to Luffy. When asked if he really believes if Luffy can defeat Donquixote Doflamingo, Sai confirms this before rushing toward Chinjao, who throws a punch at him. Leaping into the air as the punch creates a crater in a chunk of rubble further away, Sai slashes at Lao G with his polearm, only for Lao G to block it with one finger before claiming that everyone in Dressrosa is a slave to Doflamingo. Lao G grabs Sai's polearm by the handle before throwing Sai away, prompting Sai to slow himself down by dragging his blade along the ground before rushing toward Lao G again. Lao G dodges another slash and blocks Sai's kick before claiming that Sai and the other rebels will not be able to leave the Birdcage for the rest of their lives.
Sai dodges a flurry of punches before leaping back when Lao G crashes into the area where he is standing. When Lao G punches the piece of rubble he is standing on, Sai jumps to his head, prompting Lao G to acknowledge his speed before proclaiming that he will not let him have Baby 5 as Sai evades his fist once more and leaps away. With Baby 5 admiring him, Lao G states that he will save her from Sai before rushing toward him once more. As Baby 5 wonders what she should do with the two of them fighting over her, Sai shoves her away to protect her from the fight before continuing to battle with Lao G as Baby 5 watches happily. Noting that Sai could have gained the upper hand if he had taken Baby 5 as a shield, Lao G manages to punch Sai in the face, sending him crashing through a piece of rubble before slamming into a wall. Pointing out how Baby 5 will even kill herself if someone asks her to, Lao G claims that no one else is as convenient as she is.
As Baby 5 tears up at the thought of being convenient, Sai gets to his feet as Lao G proclaims he will finish him with the last secret technique. Sai assumes a battle stance as Lao G yells, causing the ground around him to rupture and crater, before declaring this is Sento Ho-Ken: Manki Kaiyaku. As Lao G rushes toward him, Sai declares that he will take Baby 5 as his wife if he wins, prompting Baby 5 to fall in love with him, before kicking Lao G's hands down to nullify his technique. Leaping into the air, Sai attacks Lao G with Hasshoken Ogi: Kiryu Kirikugi, the force of which tears open an enormous fissure in the ground below and behind Lao G, who falls into it while apologizing to Doflamingo and cursing Sai. As Sai tells Lao G to call him Don, Baby 5 sidles up to him and asks that he be patient with her.","Bellamy, Monkey D.

Luffy continues to fight Bellamy, whom he unsuccessfully tries to convince to stop attacking him and pushing himself closer to death. Meanwhile, Donquixote Doflamingo and Trebol defeat Law while Gladius attacks Cavendish.","As some of the Donquixote Pirates' underlings exclaim that Lao G has been defeated, Roronoa Zoro looks over the enormous rift in the ground created by Sai's Kiryu Kirikugi and notes how destructive it was before deciding to keep Sai and his fleet in mind due to how powerful they are. Meanwhile, Sai runs up to the battered Chinjao and begs him to not die as Baby 5 states that she will make preparations for two ceremonies, a wedding and a funeral, which prompts both Sai and Chinjao to angrily proclaim that the latter is not dead yet.
Above them, Zoro dodges another one of Pica's stone spikes as Pica laughs at him. When an irritated Zoro tells him to stop laughing because it is annoying, Pica becomes angered and demands to know what is wrong with laughing while having fun before using Charlestone once more, which sends several of his subordinates flying. Managing to dodge the spikes, Zoro runs along one of them while demanding to know who Pica is targeting before leaping forward and cutting Pica's stone face to pieces, only for Pica to escape seconds before the stone is cut. After cutting another spike in half, Zoro states that he detests how Pica keeps doing the same thing over and over again before noticing Elizabello II standing next to him. Offering to assist Zoro, Elizabello states that Riku Doldo III is an old friend of his before asking Zoro if he has figured out Pica's ability yet and explaining how he can only use his King Punch once per hour. When Zoro confirms that he has, Elizabello proclaims that he will take Pica down, but Zoro states that he will be the one to do so before telling Elizabello to save his King Punch because they do not know what is to come. Another stone spike juts out from the mountainside, forcing Zoro and Elizabello to separate as the latter agrees to save his King Punch. As Pica forms another stone face, Zoro wonders what he is up to.
Meanwhile, on Flower Hill, the ground flaps up and down like a flag, causing Kyros to lose his balance and be forced to lean on his sword for support as Diamante tells him to grovel in the dirt. Realizing that it is all connected, Diamante states that the toy soldier who was crying and screaming when he killed Scarlet was actually Kyros. When Diamante notes that there is nothing but hatred between them, Kyros agrees and leaps into the air before proclaiming that this is why he came here as he attacks Diamante, who blocks Kyros's sword with his steel cape before attacking Rebecca with Vipera Glaive. However, Kyros manages to reach Rebecca in time and blocks the attack, prompting Diamante to run toward him and seemingly attack him with Vipera Glaive, only to redirect the attack toward Rebecca at the last second. After Kyros blocks this attack as well, Rebecca realizes that Diamante is targeting her and tells Kyros she will fight as well, prompting Diamante to proclaim he will kill her as well before attacking her once more. As Kyros protects Rebecca again, Diamante states that he wants to see him lose both his wife and daughter as Kyros tells Rebecca he will fight because he wants to avenge Scarlett and compensate for teaching her how to fight before proclaiming that he will no longer let his daughter swing his sword now that he is human once more.
Elsewhere in Dressrosa, a mother and her daughter sit in a burning building as parts of the flaming ceiling fall down around them. However, they are saved by the arrival of Sabo, who extinguishes the flames before telling them that they are going to be fine. After getting the mother and daughter outside, Sabo offers them cups of water before hearing a soldier shouting that his friends are stuck in a cage at the Corrida Colosseum. When Sabo tells him to take him there, the soldier agrees and runs off, leaving Sabo to look up at the palace where Monkey D. Luffy is fighting before running after him.
In the palace, Bellamy bounces around the room with his Spring Hopper technique and proclaims that he and his technique have grown stronger just like Luffy has. As some of Bellamy's blood splashes on his face, Luffy tells him to stop before he dies, but Bellamy reprimands him for worrying about his enemy before admitting that he is aware of how he looked up to the wrong man and how foolish he is. Recalling how Luffy tried to get Donquixote Doflamingo to let him go, Bellamy declares that it would be disgraceful for him to turn his back on the man he admired simply because he did not get the response he desired. Proclaiming that even fools like him have principles to stick to, Bellamy tells Luffy that this will be his last fight and that Luffy must join him. When Luffy tells him to stop and claims that he has no reason to accept such a fight, Bellamy recalls their first meeting in Mock Town and how Luffy was the same way back then before telling Luffy to stand right there if he believes Bellamy's determination is cheap. Leaping off a wall toward Luffy, Bellamy hardens his right arm with Armament Haki before driving it into Luffy's Armament Haki-hardened abdomen.
Above them, Doflamingo and Trebol walk toward Trafalgar D. Water Law, who is limping away while clutching the stump where his right arm used to be. Kneeling down, Law picks up Kikoku before realizing Doflamingo is standing next to him as Doflamingo kicks him away. Walking over to Law, Doflamingo stomps on his wrist and asks him how long he will keep up his game of revenge as Trebol calls him pathetic. Doflamingo wonders if Law wishes to lose another arm and decides to torment him instead of killing him right away before punching and kicking Law several times in succession. When Doflamingo kicks Law away, Trebol grabs him with a thread of mucus before slamming him into the ground. Getting to his feet, Law claims that he has been willing to give up his arms from the start before running toward Doflamingo and Trebol, who states that Law must be really stupid. Law slashes at Doflamingo, who leaps into the air before cutting Law's chest with Goshikito. However, when Doflamingo lands, Law stomps on his foot and creates a ROOM before hitting Doflamingo with Counter Shock, which creates an explosion. As the smoke clears, a panting Doflamingo grabs Law and thanks him for the attack before throwing him away and piercing his body with Fullbright, which causes Law to cough up blood. As Law falls to the ground, Doflamingo looks at his jacket and promises to send him to meet Corazon.
Meanwhile, Luffy is sent crashing into a wall by Bellamy's attack and falls to his knees before telling Bellamy to stop once more. As Doflamingo reaches for his pistol upon realizing Luffy has not come up yet, Bellamy punches Luffy into the ground once more while Law grins at Doflamingo, only to be hoisted by the hood of his jacket by Trebol, who asks him how he can be so relaxed in this situation. When Luffy tells him to stop once more, Bellamy points out how he has been fired from the Donquixote Pirates, and when Luffy says this is good because Doflamingo betrayed him, Bellamy asks him if this means he should side with Luffy. After reiterating that he cannot abandon his principles like this, Bellamy crashes into Luffy once more as Trebol hits Law with Beta Launcher, causing several explosions. As flames engulf the surrounding area, Doflamingo and Trebol stand over Law, whom Trebol tells to give up as Doflamingo says he should rest.
Elsewhere, on the third level of the plateau, Gladius kneels and touches the ground as Cavendish cuts down one of his subordinates before telling him to stand up. When Cavendish claims he is very close to victory, Gladius tells him to not push his luck as the ground begins swelling up around him in domes. Realizing that Gladius has been setting these up, Cavendish runs over to Bartolomeo, who is standing behind a barrier, and tells him to let him inside, but Bartolomeo refuses because it will put himself and Nico Robin in danger. As Gladius tells his subordinates they will be fine because they are elites, Cavendish angrily demands that Bartolomeo open the barrier as Gladius uses Punc Rock Fest, causing the domes to explode while Gladius bids Cavendish farewell.","Roronoa Zoro, Baby 5, Chinjao, Sai, Pica, Elizabello II, Kyros, Diamante, Rebecca, Scarlett (flashback), Sabo, Bellamy, Monkey D.

Dellinger defeats Ideo, but is in turn brutally defeated by Hakuba, who proceeds to attack Nico Robin.","As Punc Rock Fest blows away Gladius' subordinates, Bartolomeo watches from within his barrier before noting that Cavendish would have been killed instantly by the attack were he outside. However, Cavendish kicks him away and demands to know why Bartolomeo did not let him inside from the beginning, prompting Bartolomeo to angrily ask him if this is how he thanks someone who saved him. Bartolomeo and Cavendish butt heads as Cavendish reminds Bartolomeo that he was covering him before this. Eventually, Cavendish claims that he needs to keep fighting, shocking Bartolomeo, who tells him to stay within his barrier for a while after having demanded to get in. After telling Bartolomeo that offense must come after defense, Cavendish exits the barrier as Bartolomeo promises to not let him inside next time. Cavendish tells Bartolomeo to let him in when he is in danger again, but Bartolomeo merely makes faces at him, prompting Cavendish to run off into the smoke while promising to teach him a lesson.
Demanding to know why he should put up a barrier for a jerk like Cavendish, Bartolomeo remembers that Nico Robin is trying to ascend the cliff behind him, only to turn around and see that she is doing so by creating steps with legs sprouting from the walls. As Bartolomeo expresses happiness at her being fine, Gladius sees Robin and vows to not let anyone else get in the way of the executives before firing at her with Catapult Punc. However, Bartolomeo blocks the bullets with Barrierbility: Racket and promises to not let Gladius get in Robin's way, prompting an irritated Gladius to note that he is still alive. When Robin winks at him in gratitude, a shocked Bartolomeo wonders if this means he can be her slave before telling himself that he is asking for too much as his barrier changes shape to a humanoid figure flexing in different poses.
Suddenly, Cavendish runs out of the smoke toward Gladius, who realizes he was protected by Bartolomeo's barrier as well. As Cavendish prepares to use Biken: Blue Bird and Gladius inflates his wrists in preparation for Bracchium, they are surprised and interrupted by Bartolomeo charging toward them with Barrier Bulls, which sends several of Gladius's subordinates flying. Bartolomeo proclaims that Robin's gesture is something worth risking his life for as both Gladius and Cavendish run away from him, with Cavendish demanding to know if Bartolomeo knows he is here. However, Bartolomeo claims that he cannot stop because he is losing control from feeling too high as Gladius notices Dellinger standing atop a fallen spike nearby. When asked if he has cleaned up the second level yet, Dellinger claims that it will be done soon, but Gladius orders him to help on the third level because of Robin trying to make her way up.
As Dellinger agrees and states it sounds like fun, Ideo extends his arm and grabs Dellinger's wrist before stepping out of the smoke. When Ideo reiterates that he should pay attention, Dellinger complains about how persistent he is as Ideo retracts his arm and regains his oddly-shaped shoulder. Noting that Ideo has something past his shoulder, Dellinger points out the hole in his stomach and tells him to drop dead already, but Ideo claims that he cannot do so because one must have obligation and honor in a man's world. However, Dellinger merely laughs and claims this does not sound like him before kicking Ideo away. After being kicked once more in midair, Ideo regains his footing on the ground and attempts to punch Dellinger, who dodges before kicking him twice more. Unleashing a barrage of kicks on Ideo, who coughs up blood, Dellinger wonders what happened to him while laughing, only to be shocked when Ideo throws a punch that takes off part of his hat. Kicking Ideo back, Dellinger claims that he would have spared him had Ideo merely played dead before kicking him several more times while demanding to know what good standing on his feet does. Noting that he can buy some time until Monkey D. Luffy defeats Donquixote Doflamingo, Ideo proclaims that he and the others will prevent the Donquixote Pirates from getting in Luffy's way, prompting Dellinger to stop kicking him as Ideo claims no victory in this world can be obtained alone.
Ripping off his hat, Dellinger notes that Luffy's allies are trying to obtain victory by sacrificing their lives and laughs before claiming that this is something losers would do as his eyes dilate and begin to glow red. After sprouting a set of fangs in place of his teeth, Dellinger chomps Ideo's neck, causing him to collapse and pass out in pain, before kicking his body away while telling him to not underestimate his Fighting Fish lineage. Soon afterward, Dellinger leaps up to the second level and looks around before calling out to Gladius. Hearing screams, Dellinger walks over to another area as several underlings are cut down at high speeds. When a nervous Gladius tells him to stay on the third level because they are facing a troublesome opponent, Dellinger claims that no one can face them when they are working together before being slashed by Hakuba.
As Gladius calls out to him, a trembling Dellinger looks at the blood on his hand and incredulously wonders what is going on before asking Hakuba who he is. However, Hakuba responds by slashing Dellinger several dozen more times, causing him to collapse. Looking on from within a circular barrier, a shocked Bartolomeo notes how Hakuba cut down Dellinger and the enemy soldiers so quickly before realizing there is a frightening on the other side of his barrier when he gets a clear look at Hakuba's face. Wondering who Hakuba is, Bartolomeo realizes that this is similar to what happened during the Block D match at the Corrida Colosseum before wondering if Hakuba caused that as well. As Bartolomeo ponders what ""dish"" Hakuba is if he is wearing Canvendish's clothes with a completely different face, Hakuba moves to him and slashes at his barrier, causing Bartolomeo to fall back in shock while admitting that he was caught off-guard by how fast Hakuba moved. When Bartolomeo asks him if he is Cavendish, Hakuba does not say anything before attacking the barrier several more times, only for nothing to happen. Seeing this, Bartolomeo laughs before claiming that Hakuba cannot cut his barrier with his sword.
Bartolomeo claims that Hakuba's speed is useless against his ability and states that no one can break his barrier when he has his fingers crossed. However, Hakuba sees a hole at the top of the barrier and moves to it, forcing Bartolomeo to close it off by twisting it as Hakuba slashes at it. After Hakuba lands on the ground again, Bartolomeo sighs in relief before demanding to know what he is thinking. As Bartolomeo wonders what happened to him, Hakuba sees Robin running up the cliffside as a shocked Bartolomeo tells him to not do anything stupid. Seeing Hakuba preparing to attack, Bartolomeo removes his barrier and tries to grab him, only for Hakuba to disappear and begin moving toward Robin as Bartolomeo begs him to not go after her. However, when Robin sees Hakuba running up the cliffside toward her, she grabs and restricts him with several arms sprouted from his body. As Bartolomeo tearfully proclaims that he is glad she is safe, Robin states that Hakuba's speed means nothing to her before asking him if he wants something from her.","Gladius, Bartolomeo, Cavendish, Nico Robin, Dellinger, Ideo, Rebecca (flashback), Mummy (flashback), Damask (flashback), Suleiman (flashback), Orlumbus (flashback)",

As Bartolomeo defeats Gladius with an homage to Monkey D. Luffy, Robin arrives at the Flower Hill just in time to protect Rebecca from Diamante's attack.","As she restrains Hakuba with multiple arms, Nico Robin informs him that she needs to get up to Rebecca quickly because she is worried about her. Looking on in shock, Bartolomeo exclaims that she stopped Hakuba before claiming that it was presumptuous of him to think that he needed to protect her. Robin notes that it does not seem like Hakuba will remain silent, only to be surprised when Cavendish's normal face briefly appears and tells Hakuba to wait. After seemingly falling unconscious, Cavendish looks up with his normal face before proclaiming that he did not permit Hakuba to appear. When Cavendish apologizes for almost cutting her, Robin notes that this was the Hakuba everyone had been speaking of. Confirming this, Cavendish states that he is dangerous and cuts people up at random before dozing off, causing Hakuba to reappear and threaten to cut up Robin's entire body.
Hakuba promises to cut up everything, only for Cavendish to briefly appear while claiming that he will not allow Hakuba to take control. As Hakuba tells him to stay asleep, Cavendish claims that he does not know the meaning of this fight and that there is no meaning to cutting up everything if he does not do it, only for Hakuba to proclaim that he will show his enemies a pool of blood. Looking on, a stunned Bartolomeo wonders if he has two personalities as Cavendish and Hakuba continue to argue, eventually culminating in the two of them gaining control of half of Cavendish's face as Bartolomeo exclaims that they are half and half. After fully gaining control once more, Cavendish proclaims that he is the only Cavendish, only for Bartolomeo to point out how he was half-and-half only a minute ago.
When Cavendish claims that it is alright now and asks her to release him, Robin demands to know if he is telling her to trust him after what she just saw. However, she is caught off-guard when the cliffside behind her begins expanding as Gladius decides to settle this before proclaiming that he will blow Robin up along with the wall. As Gladius states Robin cannot get away just by flying somewhere, Bartolomeo curses him while Cavendish notes Gladius will rupture them as well before telling Robin that they need to get down for now. Robin states that she cannot do so because Rebecca might get hurt during that time, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave Gladius to him, prompting Gladius to note that he has good judgment for realizing the wall will not rupture if Bartolomeo takes him down before using Punc Hair to injure Bartolomeo's leg. After claiming that this is nothing, Bartolomeo falls to his knees while noting that his leg went numb, prompting Gladius to reveal that his hair is comprised of poison needles. As Cavendish and Robin call out to Bartolomeo, Gladius's body begins to swell up as he notes that he is a Rupture Human from head to toe before informing Bartolomeo that he will explode and unleash tens of thousands of poison needles upon Cavendish and Robin if attacked.
Asking Bartolomeo what he will do, Gladius notes that Bartolomeo will not survive the explosion of his body as Bartolomeo realizes Robin will be injured either way. As Gladius commends him for being a quick learner, Bartolomeo tells himself that his priority is protecting Robin's body and that he needs to take down Gladius in order to do so before noting that thousands of poison needles will hit Robin if he does so. Meanwhile, Cavendish tells Robin to let go of him and run before falling asleep once more as Bartolomeo realizes there is someone expendable near Robin. When Bartolomeo tells Cavendish to protect Robin with his body while he deals with Gladius, Hakuba tells him to shut up, prompting Bartolomeo to exclaim that Cavendish is useless even in this critical situation. Wondering what he should do, Bartolomeo realizes what he can do and gets to his feet before charging at Gladius, who wonders if he is attacking. Bartolomeo notes that his restriction of only being able to put up one barrier at a time does not matter and proclaims that he will not hesitate if it is for the sake of protecting Robin before using Barrier Ball to create a spherical barrier around a surprised Gladius.
As he pulls out a knife, Bartolomeo tells Gladius to blow up as much as he likes because they are inside his unbreakable barrier before stabbing him. Gladius calls Bartolomeo a fool for being willing to sacrifice himself before blowing himself up with Fashion Punc, causing Bartolomeo to be sliced and stabbed by dozens of poison needles. As Robin calls out to him, Bartolomeo notes that this will stop the rupture of the wall before falling on the ground. However, to Bartolomeo's shock, Gladius appears before him and points out that Bartolomeo stabbed his shoulder instead of his throat before reminding Bartolomeo that the rupturing of the wall will not stop as long as he remains conscious. Meanwhile, Cavendish apologizes to Robin before revealing that he brought Hakuba under control and left half of his body under his control as Hakuba promises to kill her. Promising that he will use Hakuba's speed to get Robin to the Flower Hill, Cavendish claims that they do not have any other options and asks her to let go of him.
While Robin wonders which side of Cavendish this is, Gladius declares that this is over before using Punc Rock Super Arena to blow up the wall. As rubble bounces off the barrier around him, Gladius notes that he likes it while a tearful Bartolomeo screams over his seeming failure, only to be shocked alongside Gladius upon seeing Cavendish carrying Robin to the top of the cliff with Hakuba's speed. When Hakuba asks him why he stopped his sword with his own hand, Cavendish tells him to listen every now and again before falling asleep once more. After using Cien Fleur: Spider Net to catch herself and Cavendish, Robin notes that Cavendish stopped Hakuba's blade for her before calling him a complicated man. Meanwhile, an incredulous Gladius wonders how they could have escaped the explosion before clutching his shoulder as Bartolomeo, happy that Robin is safe, releases the barrier.
As Gladius falls to his knees, Bartolomeo angrily wonders what he is doing if he could not save the one he was trying to protect before recalling the first time he saw Monkey D. Luffy in Loguetown. Getting to his feet, Bartolomeo recalls tracking Luffy's rise in infamy, trying to replicate his moves, and witnessing Luffy's actions in the tournament before proclaiming that he should be ashamed of himself in comparison. Deciding that he will one day become a man whom Luffy can rely on for help, Bartolomeo leaps toward Gladius before hitting Gladius with Homage: God's Fist: Bari Bari no Pistol, defeating him. Bartolomeo collapses and notes that he barely won with Luffy's power before proclaiming that he will never work with a troublesome guy like Cavendish again.
Meanwhile, on Flower Hill, Diamante notes that it is very noisy down there and claims that even a Corrida Colosseum gladiator would lose his footing on unstable terrain like the ground he is making flutter.

Thanking her, Kyros states that he could not contain his rage for much longer.

When Bartolomeo points out how Gladius is not dead yet, the underlings proclaim that they want to treat him even if it takes a few days for him to regain consciousness. As the underlings beg him to show mercy, Bartolomeo angrily tells them to get going already, prompting them to run away with Gladius while noting that Bartolomeo will pay for pushing his luck like this.
On the first floor of the royal palace, two more underlings carry Dellinger to a large door, only to trip and send his unconscious body sprawling on the ground as three more underlings berate them. However, they are interrupted by Giolla, who demands to know how they could treat a member of the Donquixote Family like this. Apologizing profusely, the two underlings accidentally throw Dellinger behind them onto the floor, prompting Giolla to refuse to forgive them before turning them into art, which she calls ""Penance"". After ordering the other underlings to put Penance somewhere in the palace where others can see it, Giolla expresses disbelief at how the executives are being defeated one after another before being informed by another underling that Gladius will be carried in soon. Surprised by this news, Giolla notes that she must get things started as soon as possible before ordering the underling to bring ""it"" to her as someone cries in a cell.
Elsewhere, Viola, having seen all of this, wonders what Giolla plans to do before noticing that the Den Den Mushi in her hand is ringing and realizing that it is coming from the SMILE Factory. At the factory, Senor Pink spins around while upside down in the concrete as Kyuin and three other girls look on with admiration. When Franky throws a punch at him, Senor Pink traps his arm with his legs before flipping him on his back as the dwarves contact Viola with a Den Den Mushi. Wicca informs Viola that they are the team at the factory as Inhel asks her what is happening with Mansherry and Leo's group. As a tearful Maujii hopes that Mansherry is not having a hard time, Viola reveals that things just became worse, prompting Wicca to ask if something happened to Mansherry. Telling the group that she will call Leo now, Viola contacts Leo, who informs her that he and Kabu are approaching the Rampart Tower as they speak. As Kabu states that they will reach the chapel soon, Viola informs them that they need to move quickly because Giolla is forcing Mansherry to use her ability. Leo is shocked by this as Wicca tells him to hurry up.
At the Rampart Tower, several underlings see Leo and Kabu approaching and begin firing at them, though Leo and Kabu easily dodge the bullets. Seeing this, one of the underlings decides to blow them and the staircase up with a bomb, but Leo and Kabu kick him and his ally into the ground before dispatching the rest of their attackers. Promising to get there as fast as they can, Leo asks Mansherry to hold on for a bit longer. Meanwhile, Giolla tells Mansherry to do as she says already, only for Mansherry to claim that she cannot do it anymore before asking Giolla to let her go back to Green Bit. However, Giolla demands to know whom Mansherry called Boa Hancock, prompting Mansherry to point out that she did not say anything like this. Giolla tells Mansherry that it is time to use her ability and points out the defeated Lao G, Dellinger, Sugar, and Machvise behind her before noting that those who defeated them are also badly injured. Proclaiming that Mansherry reviving the fallen executives with her Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers means certain death for their enemies, Giolla notes that there will be a drastic shift in the tides of battle before ordering Mansherry to revive the executives with the watering can filled with healing water that she used to heal Sugar.
As Giolla pokes her face and the underlings behind her laugh, Mansherry reveals that she knows of how the Donquixote Pirates are enemies of Riku Doldo III and how Donquixote Doflamingo has been lying to the Tontatta Tribe. When Giolla demands to know why this is important, Mansherry declares that she does not want to heal bad people anymore, which makes Giolla tear up at how cute she finds Mansherry to be. However, when the underlings declare that Mansherry is cute as well, Giolla berates them for being fooled and shoves them aside before demanding to know whom Mansherry called a once-in-a-millennium beauty. Giolla advances toward Mansherry, who denies saying anything like this while mentally begging Leo to help her. Picking up Mansherry, Giolla asks her if she cares whether or not her friends at the SMILE factory remain safe, only for Mansherry to point out that the executives will hurt people if she heals them. Giolla grasps Mansherry's head before proclaiming that she will squeeze her power out no matter what it takes, prompting Mansherry to cry out to Leo for help once more.
Elsewhere, Leo and Kabu rush down a hallway as an underling fires a cannonball at them. Though Leo dodges, Kabu is hit, prompting Inhel to wonder what happened to him. Telling Leo to go on, Kabu promises to catch up with him later and claims that he is alright, which Leo grudgingly agrees to do. The underling attempts to shoot Leo as well, but Leo jumps in the air and dodges the cannonball, which hits the ceiling and buries the underling and his companion in rubble as Leo rushes out. Meanwhile, Giolla continues to hurt Mansherry while demanding that she take out the watering can, only for Mansherry to claim that Giolla is hurting her as a tear falls from her eye. The tear lands on an injured underling beneath Mansherry and heals him, to the surprise and delight of Giolla, who is informed by another underling that Mansherry's tear fell on him.
Walking over to the unconscious executives, Giolla notes that Mansherry's tears can heal as well before ordering her to cry while hitting her dozens of times in rapid succession. Seeing this, Viola frantically tells Leo to hurry, prompting Leo to confirm that he will do so before charging through more underlings. When Riku asks her what is wrong, Viola reveals that Giolla has discovered the healing properties of Mansherry's tears and is beating her in order to make her cry, causing the dwarves to tear up as Maujii attempts to go save Mansherry, only to be held back by Bomba, Bobomba, and Baxcon as Bomba tells him that they have to rely on Leo and Kabu for now. At the plateau, Usopp expresses surprise at Mansherry being able to heal others, prompting Viola to explain that she ate the Chiyu Chiyu no Mi, which allows her to heal. As Usopp notes that this must be why the enemy wants her, Kin'emon and Kanjuro confirm this as Viola reveals that Giolla is trying to use this power to revive the fallen executives.
Inhel declares that there will be a crisis if she succeeds as a shocked Usopp notes that the executives will keep coming back no matter how many times they are beaten. As Kin'emon states that there will be no end, the dwarves encourage Leo and Kabu to keep going while Usopp asks Viola if Sugar is among the executives whom Giolla has gathered, prompting him and the dwarves to express shock when Viola reveals that she is. The dwarves and Usopp recall their experiences with Sugar as Usopp declares that their efforts will be meaningless if the executives come back. As Usopp and the dwarves cheer him on, Leo blasts through the remaining underlings in the hall before arriving in the room with Giolla, Mansherry, and the executives. However, Giolla claims that Leo is too late as the underlings in the room advance on him. Though Leo quickly defeats the underlings, Giolla manages to get Mansherry crying and begins sprinkling her tears on the executives while declaring that the second round begins now. Suddenly, Kabu rushes into the room and tells Leo to deal with Giolla before knocking the executives out of the way of the falling tears with Beetle Upper.
Leaping between the executives and the defeated underlings, Leo attaches them to his needle with thread as Giolla declares that she will simply line up the executives and try again. However, Leo threads his needle throughout her dress and promises to make sure she and the others are never separated again before defeating Giolla with Haute Couture: Patch Work by pulling on the thread, causing those whom he caught before to slam into Giolla, knocking her unconscious. As she falls, Giolla lets go of Mansherry, who happily notes that Leo came to save her like a prince as Leo catches her in his arms. Meanwhile, having seen this, Viola declares to the others that Leo made it, prompting them to yell in excitement and commend Leo for a job well done. Grabbing Leo's suspender, Mansherry tells him that she was scared, only for Leo to inform her that she has gained some weight, which prompts Mansherry to punch him as Kabu notes that it is the same as ever.
At the royal palace, Bellamy continues to bounce around the room with Spring Hopper while hitting Monkey D. Luffy repeatedly. After being smashed into a wall, Luffy tells Bellamy that he really will die if he keeps going because his body is injured, only for Bellamy to hit him once more while noting that he is still worrying about his enemy despite taking so many blows. When Bellamy claims that Luffy must have also gone through an event that shattered his confidence, Luffy glares at him, prompting Bellamy to hit him from behind while proclaiming that he might be able to remain in Doflamingo's memory for a little longer if he manages to take down Luffy before dying. Bellamy punches Luffy, who coughs up blood, before continuing to bounce around the room as Luffy looks at him with a determined look on his face.","Nico Robin, Kyros, Rebecca, Diamante, Bartolomeo, Gladius (K.O.), Dellinger (K.O.), Giolla, Mansherry, Viola, Riku Doldo III, Senor Pink, Kyuin, Franky, Bobomba, Bomba, Chao, Cotton, Flapper, Inhel, Maujii, Nubon, Pellini, Rampo, Wicca, Leo, Kabu, Machvise (K.O.), Sugar (K.O.), Lao G (K.O.), Hajrudin (flashback), Chinjao (flashback), Ideo (flashback), Baxcon, Usopp, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, Bellamy, Monkey D.

Episode 715,The Manly Duel — Senor's Elegy of Love,25-Oct-15,"Luffy continues his fight with Bellamy while trying to convince him to stop fighting. Leo, Mansherry, and Kabu escape the palace, but Giolla fails to inform Doflamingo that Mansherry has been taken, making their backup plan invalid. Meanwhile, Franky and Senor Pink continue their brutal battle, with Senor Pink using his ultimate move. Franky still stands and defeats him. Senor Pink then remembers his wife Russian and his son Gimlet, and the mistakes that led him to dress like a baby in remembrance of them.","Luffy continues to persuade Bellamy to stop stating Doflamingo isn't worth dying for. Bellamy refuses to listen and continues his assault on Luffy.
Mansherry attempts to flirt with Leo and asks him to carry her since she hurt her legs. Leo obliviously thinks her selfish side showed up and says she can just heal herself since she's always been very fast. This upsets Mansherry stating she's not running and didn't ask Leo to save her. Leo is angered about her mood swings and is whacked over the head by Kabu telling him to just carry her stating they don't have time to mess around. Leo carries her on his back complaining about her attitude while the Princess is happy to have him carry her while Kabu notes Leo is so thick, noting that Mansherry is polite and kind to everyone but Leo due to her feelings for him. Just as they leave Giolla regains consciousness commenting she must alert Doflamingo immediately. Knowing his calculations of Mansherry's Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers to restore anything at the cost of one's lifespan, that should anything happen to the SMILE Factory, it can easily be restored to its original form. She is unable to move and pleads with Senor Pink to protect it at all cost.
At the SMILE factory, Franky and Pink are still at it with the cyborg landing a Strong Hammer on Pink's face. However, Pink uses the momentum to dive underground and grab Franky from behind using his MeowMeow Suplex again. Both then fall over exhausted from their injuries. The Dwarves and fans alike note they are both at their limit while asking them both why they don't dodge their attacks, stating they took them both on 30 times each. Franky states when a man is offered a drink he can't turn away from it stating Pink is a hard man. He shouts he will not dodge a single attack and take them all one and come out on top saying that is his ""strong style"". He knows the Dwarves are worried but it is a duel between men and promises he will win in his own way and won't let them become slaves again.
Senor Pink is touched by these words and states he'll remember them stating he's not as young as he used to be and will finish this with the next move, prompting one of his fans to note how far away he is. He then asks if what Franky said is true and that men don't go back on their word if he takes his attack without dodging. He swims towards Franky telling him to try to survive this next move proclaiming if he does survive he will admit defeat and take any punishment from Franky. Franky says it's a deal while being grabbed by Pink and swam outside the factory up a tower, much to the shock of the Dwarves. Pink notes how the sky is darker than usual wishing he could keep going up higher to see his wife Russian and his son Gimlet but gravity is between them, prompting Franky to ask what he means. Pink reveals he knew of Franky's cyborg body and how is back is his weak spot and unleashes a devastating attack called ""Baby Buster"" crashing Franky into the ground. As Pink emerges seemingly victorious, he turns around shocked to see Franky, who's left eye seems to be more cybernetic now, emerges from the rubble. Pink keeps true to his word and admits defeat while apologizing to the Young Master. Franky unleashes a brutal ""Franky Iron Boxing"" on Pink, thrashing him around with his enlarged fists.
While being assaulted, Pink reminisces the first time he met Russian on a rainy day for their first date. When she says she hates pirates she asks Pink what he does and he lies about being a banker. In time they marry and have a son named Gimlet. He juggles his duties to his family and crew and returns one day to discover of Gimlet's death. Russian reveals he had a fever a week ago just as Pink disappeared and the doctor's couldn't help him. She reveals his lies shouting she called the bank and they never heard of him demanding to know who he really is. She angrily slaps him and runs off telling him to not follow her. However, she fell in a landslide from the rain and sand and was buried on top leaving her in a vegetative state stating she does not have long to live. Pink can only grieve over her condition blaming himself for her and Gimlet's fates. He then regularly visits her for the next year doing everything in his power to get her to smile again. He wishes to hear her voice and see her smile even a little so he puts on Gimlet's bonnet since he had his face. Just as he puts it away thinking it wasn't funny he's shocked to see Russian smile.","Monkey D.

Meanwhile, Kyros battles Diamante and endures his Death Enjambre while convincing Rebecca to not shed blood with her innocent hands.","In the past, several people at a hospital scream in surprise as Senor Pink walks through the hallways with a bonnet on his head, a pacifier in his mouth, and nothing but a diaper on his legs while carrying flowers. Upon reaching Russian's room, Senor Pink enters and greets her, and after a few seconds Russian smiles at the sight of him. As Senor Pink happily sets down the flowers near her bed, a doctor and nurse watching from the door look at each other in surprise. Later, Senor Pink opens his closet to look for clothes to wear, but sees the bonnet and decides to wear it again along with the pacifier. As Senor Pink walks through the streets, those around him how in laughter and sarcastically compliment his clothing, while a man tells a woman near him that he lost his wife and child in an accident, prompting her to note that his spirit must have been broken.
Later, Diamante and Trebol laugh at Senor Pink's attire as Diamante wonders what he is doing. While Trebol asks Senor Pink if he is trying to be funny, Gladius asks him what happened to his suits as Lao G claims this is embarrassing. However, Senor Pink merely says he is going out, leaving Trebol shocked. Soon afterward, Senor Pink walks by two boys, who call him a pervert, as others on the street say similar things. However, most of the pedestrians leave the street when it begins to rain, leaving Senor Pink standing under a store overhang with a couple and their baby inside behind him. After the rain makes him think of Russian, Senor Pink rushes to her room in the hospital and apologizes for being late, only for some of the flowers he is carrying to fall on the floor. As Senor Pink kneels to pick them up, he sees Russian smiling once more and tells her that his outfit is worth more to him than any expensive suit is.
In the present, Franky continues pummeling Senor Pink, who recalls the first time he met Russian, before sending him flying with one last punch. As his sunglasses shatter, Senor Pink notes that the rain which Russian loved so much has stopped. However, upon seeing the sunlight come through the clouds above, Senor Pink begins to cry while remembering Russian once more and lands on the ground below. As the dwarves and Senor Pink's groupies call out for the two of them, Franky limps over to Senor Pink and asks him why he is crying before wiping the tears off his face while telling him to tell him about Russian over drinks one day. As Kyuin and the groupies rush to Senor Pink's side, Franky approaches the SMILE Factory alongside the dwarves, whom he commands to destroy the factory. The dwarves rush inside as Franky tells Monkey D. Luffy he will leave the rest up to him before collapsing.
Meanwhile, as the Marines in the city rush to help the wounded, Diamante creates a huge fissure in the Flower Hill with his sword before telling Kyros that they will have showtime together. Telling Kyros that he wants to see the miserable image of a father and daughter dying together, Diamante attacks him with Hangetsu Glaive, creating another fissure as Kyros, Rebecca, and Nico Robin are sent flying back, before claiming that Kyros forgot his place earlier. Diamante asks Kyros if he thought he was simply a talented matador with the power to make things ripple before proclaiming that he is the current hero of the Corrida Colosseum. When Kyros proclaims that he does not care about the title and stabs at him, Diamante simply turns himself into a flag and winds around Kyros before heading toward Rebecca and Robin, only for Kyros to leap into the air and attack him once more.
After dodging Kyros's attack, Diamante clashes with him before using Army Bandera to make the flower field ripple and warp underneath Kyros, who is tossed from place to place by the ground before clashing with Diamante several more times. When Kyros dodges a stab from him, Diamante flattens his sword and turns it around, forcing Kyros to dodge once more. As Diamante commends him for almost landing a hit, Kyros falls to his knee, prompting Diamante to note that his exhaustion is to be expected given how he has been running around and protecting his daughter on a wavering field all day with only one leg before claiming that he would have already collapsed if he were a normal person. Elsewhere, Tank Lepanto asks Viola how Kyros is doing, prompting her to reveal that he is completely exhausted.
Telling Diamante that he does not have to worry about his missing leg, Kyros proclaims that he would not have come to this battlefield if he intended to use it as an excuse before declaring that he is proud of his missing leg because he dedicated it to someone whom he owed a lot to. However, Diamante merely notes that this means he does not have to hesitate to strike Kyros's weak point and claims that simply dealing a final blow to Kyros would be too boring while taking out several oddly-shaped flat objects from inside his cape. Asking Kyros if he wants to play a game, Diamante throws the objects in front of him, causing them to regain their three-dimensional shape as cannons, before declaring that this is the last showtime as the cannons fire something into the air.
When Rebecca wonders if the objects in the air are confetti, Diamante reveals that these are actually objects which he made flat with his power and declares that he will undo his power before using Hira Release, causing the objects to turn into spiked iron balls. As Diamante states that the balls look like beautiful stardust, Kyros tells Robin to protect Rebecca as Diamante claims the balls can kill an entire army. Robin notes that she is glad that they are in a flower field before summoning dozens of hands with Mil Fleurs to chop down sunflowers as Diamante brings out an iron umbrella. Telling his opponents to struggle as they please, Diamante bids them farewell before using Death Enjambre, causing the spiked balls to begin raining down. However, Robin uses Hanagasa to form a tree of sunflowers and hands over herself and Rebecca, forming a shield from the spiked balls as she notes that this was close.
As Diamante notes that Robin is handling this quite well, Kyros tells him to pay attention, prompting Diamante to turn around in surprise to see Kyros deflecting the iron balls with his sword while declaring that no good army could be defeated by this technique. Kyros leaps toward Diamante, who wonders if he could even avoid getting wet in the rain before taking out his pistol and shooting Kyros in his leg, causing him to fall to the ground. As a shocked Rebecca screams for him, Kyros yells in pain as the spiked balls land on him while a laughing Diamante reprimands Kyros for stumbling now. Declaring that she will never forgive Diamante, Rebecca attempts to run toward him, only for Robin to restrain her while pointing out that there are still spiked balls falling out there.
Diamante reveals that this is the same gun that he shot Scarlett with and tells Kyros that he should be happy to die by the same gun that killed his wife, prompting Rebecca to declare once more that she will never forgive him. Hearing this, Diamante commends her for saying this before trying to goad her into fighting him. As Rebecca tells Robin to let her go because she needs to kill Diamante, a spiked ball pierces the flower tree, prompting Robin to wonder how much longer it will last. However, Rebecca and Diamante are stunned to see a heavily wounded Kyros standing up in the rain of spiked balls as Kyros proclaims that this is his fight. Telling Rebecca to drop her sword, Kyros points out how she has followed her mother's wish of not hurting anyone for a decade as Rebecca pleads with him to get under the tree. As Rebecca recalls how she was berated for never shedding blood in the Corrida Colosseum, Kyros declares that her hands are still clean and that Scarlett's spirit lives on in them. A tearful Rebecca drops her sword as Kyros, claiming that there is no need to bathe her hands in the blood of a devil like Diamante, leaps toward Diamante while declaring that he will not let Rebecca hold a sword.","Senor Pink, Russian (flashback), Diamante, Trebol (flashback), Gladius (flashback), Lao G (flashback), Gimlet (flashback), Franky, Kyuin, Chao, Inhel, Wicca, Bian, Bomba, Flapper, Rampo, Nubon, Baxcon, Bobomba, Monkey D.

Episode 717,Trueno Bastardo! Kyros' Furious Strike!,8-Nov-15,"Kyros continues his grueling battle with Diamante before finally defeating him. As the citizens celebrate, Pica abandons his fight with Roronoa Zoro to confront Kyros.","Leaping toward Diamante, Kyros slashes at him, resulting in a shockwave that blows Diamante back. While dodging and blocking Kyros's attacks, Diamante expresses disbelief at him being able to move during Death Enjambre. After moving away from Kyros, Diamante asks him if his body is an iron ball, only to note that Kyros must be feeling immense pain after seeing a spiked ball land in his arm before demanding to know if Kyros is a ball of stupidity. However, Kyros proclaims that feeling pain is a mark of being human and that the Donquixote Pirates do not understand this before clashing with Diamante once more. Recalling Scarlett's death, Kyros continues clashing with Diamante before claiming that the Donquixote Family does not understand the pain of losing someone they love or being unable to feel whatever they touch. Declaring that what he is currently feeling does not hurt when compared to the tragedies which Dressrosa has suffered, Kyros leaps forward and resumes clashing with Diamante.
After noting that Diamante called him a ball, Kyros proclaims that he will become a ball of the anger of Dressrosa and strike Diamante down before cutting his iron umbrella in half. Shocked by this, Diamante expresses surprise at Kyros's power and compares his glory to that of 20 years ago before crossing blades with Kyros multiple times. Telling Kyros to not underestimate his sword skill, Diamante uses Hangetsu Glaive, only for Kyros to leap over the resulting fissure in the ground before resuming his clashing with Diamante. Elsewhere, upon noticing her flinch, Riku Doldo III asks Viola if something happened to Kyros and Rebecca, prompting Viola to reveal that Rebecca is fine before noting that the fight is intense enough for her to feel Kyros's anger and pain through her Clairvoyance.
On Flower Hill, Diamante continues to cross swords with Kyros while calling him a monster for having not collapsed yet. Suddenly, Kyros falls to his knee, prompting Diamante to note he has finally reached his limit as the last of the iron balls hits the ground. Approaching Kyros, Diamante raises his sword above his head while proclaiming that he will end this for Kyros as he did with Scarlett. As an angered Kyros recalls his history with Scarlett, Viola curses Diamante for mentioning her again. While Riku recalls being informed of Scarlett's death. Viola recalls Diamante bragging about killing her sister and Tank Lepanto preventing her from attacking Diamante in revenge.
Proclaiming that he will not let Kyros or Rebecca escape, Diamante claims that they lost to the Donquixote Family a decade ago and that losers should accept their defeat. Upon hearing this, Kyros stands up and leaps toward Diamante, who states that his strike will rend the ground before clashing with Kyros several more times. When Kyros leaps away from a strike that creates a fissure in the ground, Diamante claims that he hopes Kyros can dodge it with his wounded leg, prompting Kyros to state that he will not dodge it before leaping forward to resume clashing with Diamante, who calls him an idiot. Leaping back, Kyros proclaims that his sword carries a decade's worth of Dressrosa's suffering and that he will take back peace before leaping toward Diamante, who prepares to use Hangetsu Glaive once more. However, Kyros intercepts his strike before using Trueno Bastardo, which cuts Diamante's sword in half and grievously wounds him.
Diamante is sent flying back and lands on Scarlett's grave marker, which causes him to cough up blood before falling to the side. Seeing Kyros stand up before Scarlett's grave, a tearful Rebecca is motioned to go to him by Nico Robin. As Rebecca runs toward Kyros, Robin falls to her knees with a wounded back before smiling. Running up to a sitting Kyros, Rebecca tells him that he needs to get medical treatment immediately before seeing the grave marker, which reminds her of Kyros in his toy form swearing to protect her with his life. Having seen this, a tearful Viola informs the others that Kyros has defeated Diamante, causing them to celebrate. As Viola reveals that Rebecca is also okay, a citizen expresses disbelief at Kyros taking down the hero of the Corrida Colosseum, prompting another citizen to remind him that Kyros was the original undefeated champion.
Turning around, Viola declares that the members of the Donquixote Family have been defeated one by one by allies of the Straw Hat Pirates before revealing that four still remain: Bellamy, Pica, Trebol, and Donquixote Doflamingo. As the citizens present lament how they were trying to kill the Straw Hats, Riku begins to walk away, prompting Usopp to ask him where he is going. When Riku explains how he is going to the town because he believes there is still something he can do, Tank joins him as the citizens to decide to go as well in order to tell the others that there is still hope. As Kanjuro notes that things are turning in their favor, Usopp wonders where Issho went, prompting Kanjuro to point out that he left a while ago.
Meanwhile, in the town below, Issho asks a Marine what the situation is like, prompting him to report that they have not gotten everything under control yet. Hearing this, Issho tells him and the other Marines present to gather all the citizens in one place where they can be defended. As the Marines run off, Issho turns around and looks toward the plateau as Roronoa Zoro slashes through one of Pica's stone arms with Samon before cutting another stone arm to pieces with Hirameki followed by Toro. After cutting Pica's stone face into sections with Otoro, Zoro lands on the ground and enters his Nigiri stance, only for a laughing Pica to inform him that this is where their fight ends because he has something to attend to as his stone face slides into the mountain behind it. When Zoro attempts to pursue him, several stone spikes appear to block his way as more appear along the side of the mountain.
On Flower Hill, Rebecca notes that the field is shaking before being thrown into the air alongside Kyros by a stone spike as several more appear. Watching this, Robin sees Pica's face forming atop one of the spikes and recognizes him. As Kyros and Rebecca hit the ground, Pica berates Diamante for looking so pathetic in defeat as Kyros moves in front of Rebecca while drawing his sword.","Kyros, Diamante, Nico Robin, Rebecca, Scarlett (flashback), Riku Doldo III, Viola, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, Usopp, Hack, Tank Lepanto, Hajrudin (flashback), Machvise (flashback), Lao G (flashback), Sai (flashback), Baby 5 (flashback), Dellinger (flashback), Cavendish (flashback), Bartolomeo (flashback), Gladius (flashback), Bellamy (image), Pica, Trebol (image), Donquixote Doflamingo (image), Issho, Roronoa Zoro",

Luffy begs him to stop before he kills himself, prompting Bellamy to reprimand him for still saying this. As Luffy points out how his body has reached its limit, Bellamy punches him in the face with his Armament Haki-coated fist, sending Luffy rolling back, before continuing to bounce around the room while declaring that he will decide where he dies himself. Reminding Luffy that he intends to become the Pirate King, Bellamy braces himself on the ceiling and proclaims that Luffy should not let himself be held up by these sorts of situations before smashing into him and punching his torso, causing Luffy to cough up blood.
Meanwhile, on Flower Hill, Kyros stares down Pica before falling to his knee, prompting Rebecca to express concern. Kyros notes that it was obvious from the start that the fight would never end as long as another opponent remained before telling Rebecca to fall back because he must put this country back in the hands of Riku Doldo III. Hearing this, Pica asks him and Rebecca what Riku is to them before reminding Rebecca that she has been cursed at and Kyros that he had lost his leg and become a toy because of him. However, Rebecca counters with the fact that the Donquixote Pirates framed him as Kyros declares that he owes Riku a lot for taking him in as a young boy before proclaiming that the people of Dressrosa were happy while the peace-understanding Riku family ruled even though they were not as prosperous. Claiming that Riku taught them simply living was happiness, Kyros tells Pica that the whole country wants him on the throne and the Donquixote Pirates kicked out.
Pica merely states that he understands before disappearing, prompting Nico Robin to wonder what is going on. As the ground begins rumbling, Pica uses Charlestone, causing another spike to emerge from the hillside as a shocked Bartolomeo wonders what just happened. Robin realizes that Pica just went to the third level as more spikes emerge, prompting Roronoa Zoro to curse Pica while demanding to know if he wants to fight or not before promising to cut him down once Pica enters his range. However, upon seeing Pica attacking several Donquixote Family underlings and an unconscious Hajrudin, Zoro realizes he is attacking the injured as Sai tells Baby 5 to watch out. When Baby 5 tries to hold onto his arm, Sai reprimands her for getting too close, prompting Baby 5 to tell him to not be so shy since they will be husband and wife. Appearing behind Baby 5, Pica declares that she has betrayed them before using Ishiusu on her, prompting Sai to push her out of the way before being hit by the two spiked sphere halves himself.
As Baby 5 and Chinjao call out to him, Sai manages to push the two sphere halves apart while coating most of his body in Armament Haki, prompting Chinjao to offer to help him get out. However, a panicked Sai tells him to look out as Pica uses Charlestone on all of them, along with Ideo. Managing to dodge the stone spikes, Sai lands on the ground before cursing Pica as Zoro runs toward them. Unsheathing one of his swords, Zoro demands to know how Pica could attack the injured, only for Pica to attack him with Bitestone, which he counters using Baki. With one half of his stone face rising into the air, Pica asks Zoro if he knows who is on the King's Plateau, prompting Zoro to cut him in half once more while declaring that the king of Dressrosa is there. Rising behind Zoro, Pica reminds him that Riku is the former king, only to be cut in half once more as Zoro demands to know what his point is. Pica forms another face while claiming that it is unfair for only Donquixote Doflamingo to take the blame for Dressrosa's invasion even though such things happen all the time.
Driving Zoro back with more spikes, Pica notes that the samurai and Usopp are on the plateau alongside the former officials of Dressrosa and that the whole country seeks Riku's restoration. When Zoro asks him why this matters, Pica declares that it angers him because Doflamingo is the only king before suddenly going silent. After a few seconds, the ground begins rumbling once more as the giant stone statue of Pica begins shaking. As the other combatants wonder what is going on, the statue detaches itself from the mountain and reforms its missing parts as the citizens below flee in terror. Now in control of the statue, Pica declares that Dressrosa is Donquixote's country before beginning to walk forward. As Usopp wonders what he is planning, Zoro runs toward Pica and slashes through several stone obstacles while wondering if Pica plans on killing Riku.
While the terrified citizens below attempt to outrun him, Pica takes a step forward, flattening the land beneath him while creating a shockwave that sends the nearby buildings and Marines flying. As the Marines open fire on Pica to no avail before being sent flying by another step, Zoro continues to run toward Pica while noting that Pica drove him out this far so that he could not catch up to him. noting that he has to do something soon because it will only take Pica one punch to flatten the plateau and kill Usopp and Riku in an instant. Several underlings fire on Zoro in an attempt to prevent him from interfering with Pica, but Zoro simply cuts them down before moving on. Seeing the spikes below her being destroyed, Robin realizes Zoro is on the move as Kyros notes there is no way to stop Pica's giant body.
As he runs, Zoro begins thinking of plans to take Pica down. His first plan is a long-distance slash, but Zoro notes that it would travel too far and thus be too weak. His second plan is jumping on top of Pica, but Zoro quickly realizes that it would be impossible to jump so high. His third plan is to warn Usopp and the others, but Zoro notes that they would not hear him from this distance. His fourth plan is to call Usopp on the Den Den Mushi and tell him to run, but Zoro finds that he does not have it with him after reaching into his jacket. As Pica continues moving toward the plateau, Zoro notes that there is not enough time for Usopp and the others to flee anyway as several cheering underlings are knocked out by Pica's footsteps. Baby 5 notes that Pica plans to kill Riku, prompting Sai to admit that he does not like it even though it is none of his business as Orlumbus wonders what they should do.
While Bartolomeo challenges Pica to fight him instead of attacking Usopp, Usopp and the samurai scream in terror as Elizabello II notes that he is glad that he saved his King Punch as Zoro instructed him. As Elizabello promises to use it to save his friend Riku, Zoro tells him to wait before reminding those present that it is useless to just destroy Pica's stone body and that they need to defeat his real body. Elizabello demands to know what they should do instead as Pica reaches the plateau, prompting Orlumbus to note that they are out of time. However, as Pica cracks his knuckles, Zoro looks at Orlumbus and grins before tying on his bandanna while asking Elizabello to give him two minutes. While Pica demands to know if Riku is on the plateau, Zoro declares that his fifth plan is flying into the sky and cutting up Pica.","Monkey D.

Episode 719,A Decisive Battle in Midair - Zoro's New Special Secret Technique Blasts!,22-Nov-15,"Pica reaches and attacks the King's Plateau, but with the aid of Orlumbus, Roronoa Zoro slashes apart his stone body and cuts him down with Sanzen Sekai.","As the shocked citizens of Dressrosa look on from below before fleeing, Pica stands over the King's Plateau in his giant stone body, causing Usopp, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro to scream in terror as other combatants on the island realize that Pica will kill those on the plateau if nothing is done to stop him. Meanwhile, Elizabello II. having warmed up for his King Punch, asks Roronoa Zoro how long he will make him wait as Zoro runs up to Orlumbus and reminds him of how he threw a person like a bombshell earlier before grinning. Pica tells Riku Doldo III to prepare himself and begins winding up a punch, only to be interrupted by Marines shooting him in the face with cannonballs. However, Pica is unfazed and proceeds to stomp on the ground near the Marines, creating a massive shockwave that blows away nearby buildings and civilians, which prompts Riku to yell at him to stop before reminding Pica that he is his target.
After being told by Riku to get everyone else out of here, Tank Lepanto orders those present to get off the plateau. As Pica begins stepping toward the plateau, the civilians on it flee in terror as Tank and Viola beg Riku to retreat as well, only for Riku to order them to leave as well before stating that he is Pica's target and everyone else fleeing while he is being targeted is fine with him. Hearing this, Pica agrees to do as Riku wishes before lifting up his hand, prompting a terrified Usopp to note that it is as big as a town. Meanwhile, Orlumbus grabs and lifts Zoro into the air, prompting Sai to ask them what they are planning to do, before asking Zoro if he is sure about using a technique that is not meant to throw people safely, only for Zoro to point out that they do not have time for anything else.
When Pica promises to crush the King's Plateau along with Riku, Zoro angrily notes that he is only going after people who are not willing to fight as Orlumbus prepares himself. Claiming Riku is not a king nor fit to be one, Pica throws his punch, only to stop in surprise when the civilians surround Riku while explaining that they will not run away if he will not. As Riku once again orders to civilians to run, Pica wonders if he has regained his previous popularity before mocking Riku's failure to protect Dressrosa because of his lack of military strength and inability to defeat his enemies. Promising to destroy Riku along with his ideal, Pica begins bringing his hand down upon the plateau as Orlumbus throws Zoro with Teitoku Killer Bowling. Flying through the air toward Pica, Zoro unsheathes his third sword and coats all three blades and his hands in Armament Haki before placing one sword in his mouth. Meanwhile, Riku admits that Pica is right and claims that he will never take the throne again before proclaiming that he tried his best to be a good man.
Continuing to fly through the air, Zoro narrates that nine mountains and eight seas make up a world in which there is nothing he cannot cut while spinning the two swords in his hands. When Pica questions Riku's proclamation, Riku claims that he would rather die than kill someone in order to rule and that there is no future for a country based on slaughter, prompting Pica to mock him because his ideals represent the reason why the good die instead of making history. However, Pica's attack is interrupted by Zoro, who uses Three Sword Style Ogi: Ichidai Sanzen Daisen Sekai to cut his stone body in half horizontally, shocking all the observing combatants. Upon seeing Pica's eyes reappear, Zoro leaps off the plateau while noting that Pica escaped into the upper half of his body before slicing that half in two vertically. As the two halves fall apart, Zoro notes that Pica's body will not be able to separate into different parts of the stone before cutting off the arm of the left half where Pica is residing.
Upon seeing the fingers of the stone hand twitching, Zoro notes that Pica cannot escape into the ground while in midair before cutting off the fingers of the stone hand and demanding that Pica come out. When Pica does not respond, Zoro cuts the rest of the arm into five sections and lands on a piece of stone while asking Pica how long he plans on hiding, which prompts Pica to emerge from one of the sections while demanding to know if Zoro believes he has already won. Proclaiming that he will not lose if his body is clad in Haki, Pica coats his entire body in Armament Haki before claiming that Zoro will lose if he is knocked off from here, only for Zoro to state that this will only happen if Pica's Haki is stronger than his is. As Pica affirms that his Haki is obviously stronger, Zoro asks Pica if he knows what people call those like him before recalling his battle with Dracule Mihawk on the Baratie.
Holding his swords in a triangular formation, Zoro begins spinning them and claims that he does not have time to be held up by someone like Pica before leaping toward him as Pica attacks. Reiterating his statement of being able to cut anything, Zoro slashes Pica with Sanzen Sekai, causing Pica's helmet to split open as he coughs up blood, before telling him to stop causing innocent people trouble. As a shocked Elizabello notes that Zoro has saved his friend Riku, the rubble from Pica's destroyed stone body begins falling on the plateau, prompting Usopp to exclaim that they are going to die anyway. However, Elizabello uses his King Punch to blow the rubble away before expressing irritation at Zoro for making him use his punch to blow away stones as Zoro commends him for doing a good job.","Pica, Usopp, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, Riku Doldo III, Hack, Tank Lepanto, Viola, Kyros, Nico Robin, Rebecca, Bartolomeo, Baby 5, Chinjao, Sai, Elizabello II, Roronoa Zoro, Orlumbus, Dracule Mihawk (flashback), Yosaku (flashback), Johnny (flashback), Monkey D.

Episode 720,So Long! Bellamy's Farewell Blow!,29-Nov-15,"Citizens and fighters around the country react to Pica's defeat as Mansherry meets Kyros, who tells her to use her healing powers on those who need it more than he does. The SMILE Factory is destroyed by the dwarves, and Sabo prepares to meet Luffy at the palace. It is revealed that Luffy managed to defeat Bellamy with one hit, and then he screams out Doflamingo's name in anguish. Doflamingo, however, has a shock in store for him.","Hanging off a ledge, Roronoa Zoro recalls his training with Dracule Mihawk, in which the master swordsman informed him that having chips on the blades of his sword is an affront to his honor and that he could prevent this by hardening his blades with Busoshoku Haki. He also forbade Zoro from drinking until he mastered the technique. At the King's Plateau, Fujitora asks his men if there are any wounded, but is informed that his Devil Fruit powers kept them all safe as citizens and combatants around the country react to Pica's defeat. Meanwhile, the SMILE Factory explodes, to the shock of those who can see it. Inside, the dwarves carry tanks of SAD and smash them while proclaiming that they will no longer be taken advantage of. However, Trebol, who is watching, claims that they can still restore the factory and heal Pica because they still have Mansherry.
At the Sunflower Fields, Leo and Mansherry meet up with Kyros, Nico Robin, and Rebecca, with Mansherry offering to heal the heavily wounded Kyros. However, Kyros refuses to let Mansherry do this because he believes there is some limit to her powers and that there are those in the country who need such healing more than he does. As Mansherry looks over Dressrosa for the first time, Kyros notes they can only leave Donquixote Doflamingo's defeat to Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar D. Water Law. Below the palace, Koala contacts Sabo and asks him where he is, prompting Sabo to admit he is running a little late because it took some time to free all the prisoners in the Colosseum. He tells Koala there aren't that many things she can do on her own before saying he's coming when Koala says Luffy might be in danger.
Back at the King's Plateau, Usopp tearfully pulls Zoro up while Kin'emon congratulates him for defeating Pica, but Zoro tells them it is not over yet because the Birdcage is still present, which means Doflamingo is still alive. Back at the palace, Bellamy had defended his decision to attack Luffy at the cost of his life by stating that Doflamingo might remember him this way before punching Luffy into a wall. However, Luffy had pointed out that Doflamingo only wanted Bellamy to be pitted against him and die from the beginning, which Bellamy admitted was likely correct before claiming it is his dying wish to fulfill this. Bellamy then thought back to when he first met Luffy and, after his journey to Sky Island, Bellamy reacted in shock seeing the afterimage in the sky of Luffy. Bellamy told Luffy to just stand there and die if he did not want to fight back before leaping toward him, but Luffy steeled himself and punched Bellamy into the ground with a Busoshoku Haki-hardened punch, defeating Bellamy once more. Luffy screams Doflamingo's name, prompting Doflamingo to note that he hopes Luffy comes up to the roof and sees Law's corpse.","Pica, Roronoa Zoro, Dracule Mihawk (flashback), Perona (flashback), Issho, Elizabello II, Baby 5, Chinjao, Sai, Orlumbus, Bartolomeo, Kyros, Nico Robin, Rebecca, Bomba, Flapper, Inhel, Nubon, Chao, Cotton, Trebol, Leo, Mansherry, Kabu, Riku Doldo III, Koala, Sabo, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Usopp, Tank Lepanto, Viola, Bellamy, Monkey D.

Episode 721,Law Dies - Luffy's Raging Onslaught!,6-Dec-15,"Previously, Doflamingo and Trebol overwhelmed Law. Doflamingo told Law that he would grant him one wish if Law performed the Perennial Youth Operation on him. However, Law mocked Doflamingo and was shot repeatedly.
In the present, Doldo gathers more people to help the citizens, and Viola sees that Law has fallen. Luffy makes it back to the rooftop, where he attacks Doflamingo repeatedly. As Luffy notices Law lying on the ground, the Torikago begins to shrink.","As Doflamingo calls Luffy to the rooftop, it is shown what happened a few minutes earlier. Trebol used Sticky Launcher to send Law sprawling at the edge of the roof, and he and Doflamingo stood over the severely injured Warlord. Trebol expressed his surprise that Law was still alive, mockingly suggesting that he give up. Doflamingo echoed his executive's thoughts, telling Law he pitied how everything he'd done - escaping the White City, meeting Corazon, working for 13 years to depose Doflamingo, and his alliance with Luffy - had been worthless. As he pointed his gun at Law's chest, Doflamingo offered him a deal: a chance to make the rest of Law's short life meaningful by performing the Perennial Youth Operation on him. In exchange, Doflamingo offered to make any wish of Law's come true.
Law appeared to accept at first, but then requested that Doflamingo bring his dead brother Corazon back to life and submit himself to all the citizens of Dressrosa. Law laughed that Doflamingo's life was the pitiful one, saying that the Straw Hats can cause miracles. Doflamingo shot Law eight times in various places, mocking the word ""Corazon"" on Law's jacket. He furiously yelled that despite all Law's efforts to imitate Corazon, the legacy of the Heart will end.
Across the island, Tank Lepanto and the crowd of citizens on the King's Plateau decide to climb down to the city in order to assist their former king Riku. Viola confirms to Zoro and Usopp that of the opposing forces, only Doflamingo and Trebol remain standing, but their own forces have also taken a hit.
Meanwhile, Luffy breaks through the palace roof, eager to fight Doflamingo. The Warlord taunts him about Bellamy, and blocks a Gear Third punch with Spider's Web. Luffy leaps over the web and uses Hawk Gatling to attack Doflamingo from above, but Doflamingo uses Break White to surround Luffy in a mass of strings.
Luffy breaks out of Doflamingo's trap but steps on a pool of blood. Looking around, he sees Law lying on the ground. In confusion, Luffy asks Law what has happened, but he remains unresponsive. Doflamingo tells Luffy that Law is dead, shocking the pirate. As the citizens of Dressrosa realize that the Torikago is shrinking, Doflamingo mocks Law's last words and states that it is time for the game to end.

Luffy fights Doflamingo, but Law switches places with him in order to land his Gamma Knife attack on Doflamingo, forcing the Shichibukai to his knees. Law explains how he escaped death as he prepares to finish Doflamingo off and avenge Corazon.","The island of Dressrosa begins trembling as the Birdcage begins closing in on itself, and the citizens watch in shock as the strings slice the buildings into pieces. They then run toward the downtown, struggling to outpace the cage. Marines stationed on all corners of the island report that the cage is moving inwards. On the palace rooftop, Doflamingo reveals to an angered Luffy that the Birdcage is shrinking, which shocks the pirate as the Birdcage cuts up an aqueduct, flooding a large part of town. Doflamingo says that everything will be cut up in about one hour as the Marines head out to help the people at the edge of the country.
One of them helps an injured man up as another orders the citizens to run to the center of town. Meanwhile, some pirates, citizens, and a gorilla are tied up, begging to be untied so they can escape the cage. On the King's Plateau, Viola, Usopp, Zoro, Hack, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro react to the shrinking Birdcage, and near the Corrida Colosseum, the recently freed prisoner gladiators are shocked to find that after being freed from their prison, they are still being held captive. Below the King's Plateau, Riku curses Doflamingo for his destruction as a citizen near him begins losing hope. The fighters on the second and fourth levels of the palace plateau react to the shrinking cage as Robin looks up to the palace, and on the King's Plateau, Usopp begs Luffy to beat Doflamingo while Kin'emon realizes that everyone's lives are now dependent on Luffy.
On the palace rooftop, Doflamingo says that he will save nobody and that people who knew the country's secret should not be allowed to live. Meanwhile, as the citizens run toward the center of town, Sabo runs in the opposite direction. Doflamingo mockingly tells Luffy that he and all his friends would die just like Bellamy and Law already had, and Dressrosa would perish, though Doflamingo could just build another country. Luffy then rushes toward Doflamingo, saying he could stop that if he beat the Shichibukai, and Doflamingo hurls strings at him. Luffy dodges the strings and barrages Doflamingo with Haki-enhanced punches, but Doflamingo sends him hurtling to the ground with Fulbright. Luffy gets up, rushes toward Doflamingo again, and prepares an attack. Doflamingo prepares to shoot him, when Law suddenly switches places with Luffy and stabs an astonished Doflamingo with Gamma Knife.
Law tells Doflamingo that this attack will destroy him from the inside out as Doflamingo coughs up blood, shocking Trebol. Trebol asks Law how he is still alive and how he used an Ope Ope no Mi attack without creating a ROOM. Law reveals that he already made a ROOM which encompassed the entire palace plateau and was too large for them to see, at the cost of his lifespan. Law recalls how he was shot by Doflamingo, but the wound was not fatal. He then switched himself with a fallen Donquixote Pirate on the level below, and switched back after Doflamingo finished shooting his body double. When Luffy discovered his body, Law revealed that he was still alive and that he had a plan.
The Gamma Knife causes Doflamingo to sink to his knees, and a shocked Trebol tells him that a king should never be on their knees. However, an angered Doflamingo grabs Law's face and prepares to shoot him, though Law accepts it since Doflamingo will still die. However, Luffy arrives and kicks Doflamingo in the face with Gear Second, sending the Shichibukai flying and landing backfirst in a pile of rubble. Law then remembers how he met Corazon and how Corazon fought to save his life. Luffy races toward Doflamingo, but Law stops him, saying it was his job to finish the Shichibukai off. After struggling to drag himself to Doflamingo, Law stands up and creates a ROOM, ready to deal the finishing blow.","Trafalgar D. Water Law, Monkey D.

During the battle, Trebol remembers how he found a young Doflamingo and gave him the power to kill anyone he wanted.","Law stands over a beaten Doflamingo, preparing to finish the Shichibukai off and avenge Corazon. An angered Trebol attacks him, but is kicked out of the way by Luffy. Doflamingo remembers how Law came to the Donquixote Pirates resembling himself, but changed after Corazon took him in and betrayed him. Doflamingo tells Law how he really felt about Corazon, who to him was a good-for-nothing traitor. An angered Law then attacks Doflamingo with Counter Shock, causing the Shichibukai to cough up blood and convulse before going limp. A fatigued Law then steps back as he collapses from exhaustion.
Law is awoken by Luffy, and the two watch in shock as Doflamingo rises to his feet. Doflamingo reveals that he can use his powers to perform first aid by stitching his organs together, though it was not exactly healing. Trebol then grabs Luffy with a sticky chain and slams him into the floor far away from Doflamingo and Law. Doflamingo walks toward the fallen Law and prepares to kill him by stomping on his head. However, Luffy arrives and counters Doflamingo's foot with his own, and Doflamingo asks him why he did that.
Doflamingo shakes off Luffy's block and tries stomping on Law again, but Luffy counters him again. This time, both of them use Supreme King Haki, which astonishes Trebol and causes a large tremor around them. The force of their clash blows Law and Trebol away and causes a landslide to occur on the palace plateau, forcing Bartolomeo to shield himself. The clash is felt by everyone on Dressrosa, and Law watches it, knowing that his speculation that Luffy could use Supreme King Haki was true. Trebol also watches the clash, remembering how he met a young Doflamingo after the child had used it for the first time. Trebol had offered Doflamingo the ability to kill anyone he wanted, and Doflamingo replied that there were lots of people he wanted to kill. In the present, Trebol yells to Luffy that he would never be a match for Doflamingo, as Doflamingo's upbringing had caused him to become a demon.
31 years ago, a young Doflamingo stood before Trebol and his promise of power. Doflamingo remembered how he, his brother, and his father were crucified by a mob for being World Nobles. Homing begged the mob to kill him and spare his children, and Doflamingo finally snapped. He shouted at the mob that he was not going to die and that he would kill all of them. This outburst awakens Doflamingo's Supreme King Haki, which causes the mob to collapse. Later, Doflamingo stood before Trebol, Vergo, Diamante, and Pica as the first of the four revealed to him that he used Haki and so was chosen by heaven. Trebol presented Doflamingo a pistol and the Ito Ito no Mi as he offered him the ability to kill anyone he wished. Doflamingo remembered all the people who contributed to his suffering, including his father, as he wished to kill all of them. Later, Doflamingo killed his father with the gun presented to him. In the present, Trebol proclaimed Doflamingo to be the ultimate evil.
Luffy's and Doflamingo's clash ends in stalemate as Luffy attacks Doflamingo with Armament Haki. While Doflamingo blocks the first strikes with his own Haki, Luffy manages to exploit an opening and deal several blows to the Shichibukai.

Episode 724,Unassailable - The Stunning Secret of Trebol,27-Dec-15,"Trebol immobilizes Luffy and Law and explains how he and the other three Donquixote executives found Doflamingo and raised him into the man he is today. Law mocks Trebol, causing the executive to attack him in anger. However, Law defeats him, and Trebol causes a large explosion as a last resort. Luffy, Law, and Doflamingo manage to escape and fly toward the Flower Field, and Luffy gives Law to Robin, but Doflamingo attacks her.","Luffy is sent flying into the palace rooftop after clashing with Doflamingo, and Trebol catches him in a large pile of mucus, which immobilizes the pirate. Trebol tells Luffy that he will be dealt with later, but now it is time for Doflamingo to kill Law without opposition. Luffy desperately tries to fight his way out of the mucus, and attacks Trebol using Armament Haki. However, despite punching a hole through Trebol, the executive only laughs. Luffy expresses his confusion, as he thought Trebol was a Logia, but Trebol questions that assumption. Law tells Luffy it is no use, as Trebol is a papier-mache man. Law states that he was glad he left the Donquixote Pirates, because otherwise he would have had to work with people like Trebol. This angers Trebol, who pins Law to the ground with mucus.
Trebol then heads toward Law, pushing Doflamingo out of the way. He tells Law that Doflamingo is the absolute king, and that 31 years ago he and the three other executives discovered him and gave him power. 31 years ago, Trebol, Vergo, Diamante, and Pica confronted Doflamingo after the boy had used Supreme King Haki on the mob that lynched his family, saying he had been chosen by heaven and offering the power to take revenge. Doflamingo then killed his father and prepared to take his head to Mary Geoise so he could become a World Noble again. Later, the four executives confronted Doflamingo again after the boy had failed to return to the World Nobles and was almost killed. The executives offered to make Doflamingo king, if he would give them their dreams as well.
Later, Doflamingo sat and nursed a wound. Trebol found him and found out that a man in the city had given Doflamingo the wound. The executives then enter the building where the man was and confronted him about hurting Doflamingo, which the man admitted to. Trebol then shot the man and the others around him, and told the man that they were the Donquixote Family as the man passed out. The executives later proceeded to shoot up a town that Doflamingo liked in order for him to claim it, and captured several important people before blowing them up along with their building. Later, Diamante saw Doflamingo nursing a scrape on his knee, which happened as the boy fell on an uneven road. The executives proceeded to set the entire town containing the road on fire, and as Doflamingo stood on a pile of wreckage, the executives bowed before their king. As time passed, Doflamingo and the executives went anywhere they liked and the citizens hid in fear when they arrived.
In the present, Trebol tells Law that Doflamingo and the executives maintained a strong bond as they gathered new crew members, and prepares to set the mucus binding Law on fire. Law just mocks him, saying Doflamingo had been using them from the start. This enrages Trebol, who leaps at Law despite Doflamingo ordering him not to as Law activates ROOM. Trebol decides to not set the mucus on fire and instead kill Law in the most painful way possible: by shoving his staff down Law's throat. However, Law says that he was a pirate captain and for the sake of his pride could not leave both Trebol and Doflamingo to Luffy as he telepathically lifts up his severed arm, which still holds his sword. Spinning it around, Law slashes Trebol up the executive's chest. As this happens, the dwarves at the SMILE Factory suddenly feel like a weight has been lifted off their hearts. However, Franky tells them to focus and get out of the destroyed factory, as the Birdcage was approaching. Trebol reels in pain from the attack as the mucus covering him slips away, revealing him to be a very skinny hunchbacked man. Doflamingo angrily berates Trebol for his stupidity, and as a last resort to kill Law, Trebol spits mucus on his lighter, causing a massive explosion.
The fighters on the Flower Hill and King's Plateau react in shock at the explosion, and Viola looks inside the flames. She reveals with delight that Trebol has been defeated, leaving Doflamingo the only enemy left as he escapes the flames along with Luffy, who is carrying Law. Robin sees them and is shocked at how injured he is. Luffy sees Robin and throws Law down to her, and Robin catches him with her powers. However, Doflamingo is still intent on killing Law, and fires string bullets at Robin. Luffy attempts to stop him, but is too late as the bullets fly toward the Flower Field.","Monkey D.

Suddenly, Cavendish arrives and deflects all the bullets. Noticing aloud that Doflamingo had still not been defeated, Cavendish speaks to Luffy, who tells the pirate to bring Law, Robin, and the others off the Flower Field. Cavendish argues, saying he wanted to land a hit on Doflamingo, but Luffy replies that he trusted Cavendish with his allies, causing Cavendish to reason that Luffy is a fan of his, so he complies. Cavendish tells Robin that he knew Bartolomeo was on the level below, so they could use his ability to get down. Leo and Mansherry inspect Law's severed arm, with the former saying he could stitch his arm back on before Mansherry heals it with her powers. Meanwhile, Bartolomeo is still frozen in awe at Zoro defeating Pica, and Cavendish shouts at him. Bartolomeo initially refuses to help him, but gladly complies when he is told he is helping Robin.
Meanwhile, Luffy confronts Doflamingo on the palace rooftop. Doflamingo tells Luffy that he was just helping put Law out of his misery, and that Luffy was already injured. However, Luffy replies that Doflamingo was also heavily injured as he rushes toward the Shichibukai. Luffy barrages Doflamingo with Gear 2 and Armament Haki punches, managing to send him flying off the roof. However, Doflamingo only laughs, saying Luffy's punches were fast but not powerful. Doflamingo attacks Luffy with a large burning string, sending Luffy flying back. Doflamingo gets behind Luffy, remembering how he heard of Crocodile's defeat two years ago, and as a result started keeping an eye on Luffy. Two years ago, Doflamingo and Trebol reacted in shock to Crocodile's defeat and Luffy's bounty rising, with Doflamingo telling his crew to keep an eye on the Straw Hat Pirates. He was also shocked when he noticed the D. in Luffy's name. Afterwards, Luffy took part in the Summit War of Marineford, and now he had invaded Doflamingo's domain. Doflamingo expresses his surprise that Luffy had made it this far as he kicks the pirate into the edge of the rooftop, causing large chunks of the palace to fall onto the Flower Field.
The group on the Flower Field react in shock to the destruction, when Law suddenly awakes. Law tells Cavendish to leave him at the Flower Field, and both Cavendish and Robin initially refuse. However, Law tells them that he got Luffy into this fight and that it was his duty to be there during Luffy's victory, or die with him in his defeat. Robin tells Law that Luffy did not fight unless it was for personal reasons, but Law insists on staying. As Bartolomeo creates a barrier staircase, Cavendish decides to stay with Law, respecting his wish but not leaving him there to easily die. Rebecca tells Robin that Bartolomeo made them stairs as Robin nurses the wounds on her back. In response, Cavendish offers his coat to Robin and tells her to go, and she complies. As she leaves, Leo, Mansherry, and Kabu say that they will stay behind as well in order to treat Law.
The Birdcage continues shrinking, and the citizens continue running toward the center of town. The group on the King's Plateau wonders how they can stop it, when suddenly Zoro starts running away. Kin'emon and Kanjuro realize Zoro has an idea and decide to head after him. Meanwhile, Luffy and Doflamingo continue their brawl, attacking each other with Armament and Supreme King Haki, as well as their respective Devil Fruit powers. During the conflict, Doflamingo causes a large mass of strings to come from the ground and attack Luffy, and the pirate wonders where the strings came from as he avoids them and slides on them, activating Gear 2. Luffy attacks Doflamingo with Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk, and a large explosion occurs as Doflamingo blocks the attack. Luffy manages to send Doflamingo flying into the ground, but Doflamingo gets up with no sign of harm. Luffy tries attacking the Shichibukai with Gear 3, but Doflamingo easily dodges the slow attack and knees Luffy in the face, sending him flying into the ground.
Luffy struggles to get up as Doflamingo asks him if he can win before the Birdcage closes. Even though the Birdcage will close in one hour, its effects will happen before that. People unable to run effectively could possibly be caught in 30 minutes, and in 40 minutes they would be able to hear screams. In 50 minutes, Dressrosa would be caked in blood. Doflamingo tells Luffy that everyone would go out cursing him, since this would never have happened if the pirate had never set foot on the island. However, Luffy says that there was never peace on Dressrosa, remembering how Doflamingo had treated the toys and the prisoner gladiators. Saying that Doflamingo and his Birdcage stood in his way, Luffy holds his arm to his mouth and activates Gear 4.","Donquixote Doflamingo, Monkey D.

Episode 726,Gear 4! The Phenomenal Boundman!,17-Jan-16,"As the Birdcage closes in on Dressrosa, Luffy activates Gear 4, which causes his torso to balloon and forces him to constantly bounce. Doflamingo laughs at this new form, but Luffy retracts his fist into his arm and punches him, blowing him into the city far below. Luffy lands more large blows on Doflamingo as the Shichibukai struggles to keep on even footing. However, Luffy is able to change the direction of his punches and absorb Doflamingo's attacks.","As the citizens of Dressrosa continue running from the shrinking Birdcage, Marines and pirates alike assist the handicapped. Some citizens notice with a shock that the buildings not being sliced up by the Birdcage are being pushed along with it, making them even more afraid. On the second level of the palace plateau, Baby 5 explains how shrinking the Birdcage was Doflamingo's way of preventing his evil actions from being told. Sai then orders the Corrida Colosseum gladiators who are still standing to rescue the fallen and take them out of the plateau, and Baby 5 inwardly squeals in pride at her future husband's leadership, which Chinjao notes as well. Meanwhile, Viola, Usopp, and Hack climb down the King's Plateau, and Viola notices that the center of the Birdcage is shifting toward Doflamingo's location, meaning even the King's Plateau will be sliced apart. This causes Usopp to become frightened and order Hack to climb down faster. Zoro, Kin'emon and Kanjuro reach the streets of Dressrosa, and Zoro begins running in a direction. When asked where he is going, Zoro reveals that they are going to stop the Birdcage, shocking the two samurai. On the Flower Field, Cavendish examines Law's former severed arm, which had been treated by Leo and Mansherry. Cavendish says that when he worked as a toy in the underground harbor shipping Underworld materials, he realized that it would not be enough to just defeat Doflamingo himself. He tells Law that defeating Doflamingo would cause ripples all over the world, and Law replies that that is what they were after.
On the palace rooftop, Luffy casts off his sandals and Doflamingo watches in interest as he activates Gear 4. Luffy coats his arm in Armament Haki and blows into it, inflating his muscles to massive proportions. The air moves into his torso and causes it to balloon, and Luffy's Haki takes the shape of tribal flames on his chest. With that, Gear 4: Boundman has been activated, and Luffy keeps bouncing on the ground. Doflamingo laughs at the absurdity of Luffy's new form, especially the constant bouncing. However, Luffy says that he used this form during his two-year training in order to put the animals into submission, as he remembers struggling to keep up with them with normal attacks. Doflamingo is still not impressed, but Luffy begins compressing his fist into his forearm and flies toward the Shichibukai at high speed. Doflamingo attempts to block Luffy's compressed punch that was named ""Kong Gun"" with his own Haki, but the punch sends him flying into the town far below.
Doflamingo slides into a building at high speed, causing it to fall over. The citizens nearby turn to see what has happened, and Viola reveals to Usopp and Hack in shock that Luffy has taken on a new form and sent Doflamingo flying into the street. The citizens stare at the fallen Doflamingo in shock and fear, wondering what has happened to their king. Two Marines attempt confronting Doflamingo, but the Shichibukai's anger causes them to lose their footing as the citizens run away in fear. Doflamingo looks up at the palace, angered and amazed that he had been sent flying that far. Suddenly, he sees that Luffy is flying toward him by compressing his legs and jumping off the air. Doflamingo tries attacking Luffy, but his attack misses as Luffy appears behind Doflamingo and dropkicks him with ""Rhino Schneider"", sending him crashing through several buildings. The citizens stare in shock at Luffy, and get even more confused as they watch the pirate bounce uncontrollably through the streets. On the third level of the palace plateau, Bartolomeo screams in delight at Luffy's new mode, and tries to tell Kyros how big of a deal this is. However, Kyros smacks Bartolomeo out of the way because he was blocking his eyesight.
Doflamingo ends up by the King's Plateau and struggles to comprehend Luffy's new form as he flies into the air. Luffy flies up to Doflamingo's location, and the two face off. Doflamingo attacks Luffy with several string attacks, but Luffy breaks them all as the two clash head-on. Doflamingo activates Armament Haki and exchanges blows with Luffy, but the pirate physically overwhelms Doflamingo and headbutts him a long distance away. As Doflamingo flies, Luffy tries hitting him with a long punch, but Doflamingo dodges it and appears behind Luffy. Doflamingo kicks the defenseless Luffy with a Armament Haki kick, but to his shock Luffy's body absorbs the blow despite also being covered in Haki. Luffy's body recoils from Doflamingo's kick and sends the Shichibukai flying back, and Luffy prepares another punch. Doflamingo dodges it again, but using his Python technique Luffy keeps changing the punch's direction. Doflamingo uses Overheat to stop Luffy, but Luffy's punch destroys it as it finally reaches Doflamingo and hits him in the face.","Baby 5, Sai, Orlumbus, Chinjao, Elizabello II, Dagama, Blue Gilly, Boo, Suleiman, Hajrudin, Ideo, Viola, Hack, Usopp, Kanjuro, Roronoa Zoro, Kin'emon, Trafalgar D.

However, the Shichibukai reveals that his Devil Fruit has awakened, and he overwhelms Luffy by turning the surrounding area into string. Meanwhile, the people on Dressrosa continue running from the Birdcage, but start losing hope. However, Riku Doldo III galvanizes them by revealing that only Doflamingo remained standing and that Luffy would free them.","Luffy's Gear 4 punch sends Doflamingo flying through several buildings, and the citizens below stare in awe, deciding to cheer Luffy on despite not knowing who he is. On the Flower Field, Cavendish watches Luffy's new form in astonishment, but Law says that Luffy is overusing his Haki, confusing Cavendish. On the palace rooftop, Jesus Burgess searches for Luffy and sees him bouncing through the town. Koala, who hides behind a pile of rubble, remembers Burgess from the Corrida Colosseum and wonders what he wants with Luffy. Meanwhile, Viola, Hack, and Usopp have reached the Corrida Colosseum, and Viola contacts Riku Doldo III. Doldo asks if Doflamingo was the only one left standing, which Viola confirms.
In the streets below, Zoro runs toward the Birdcage when he is confronted by Kin'emon and Kanjuro. The samurai reveal that he is going in the wrong direction and tell him to get on Kanjuro's sparrow, which is struggling to carry the two samurai. Zoro gets on, causing the sparrow to strain extremely hard in order to start flying again. Meanwhile, the Birdcage reaches the SMILE Factory, and Franky sees this and tells the dwarves inside to evacuate the destroyed facility. As they exit the factory, they realize that the Birdcage is not cutting it up, which Franky realizes is because of it being made of Seastone. Zoro and the samurai then arrive, and Franky tells them that the center of town is the other way. However, Zoro reveals his intention to stop the Birdcage, leaving the dwarves in awe. As the three swordsmen fly away, Franky thinks about their plan and gets an idea.
Meanwhile, Luffy hovers in midair and looks at Doflamingo, who is still lying on the ground and pondering Luffy's Gear 4 capabilities. Luffy decides to finish Doflamingo off now in order to avoid overusing Gear 4, and Doflamingo gets up and remarks that it must take a lot for Luffy to maintain that form. Luffy retracts both fists into his forearms to unleash a powerful attack, but Doflamingo suddenly blocks it by creating two waves of string from the ground. Luffy is shocked by Doflamingo's sudden move, and the Shichibukai reveals that his Devil Fruit has awakened, allowing him to turn his surroundings into string. Doflamingo turns more and more buildings into string and presses his attack on Luffy, who comments that this makes Doflamingo's fruit no longer look like a Paramecia, and is unable to overcome the constant barrages of string.
The citizens of Dressrosa continue running from the Birdcage, but those who are unable to run properly find the cage catching up to them, and a mother has lost her son. People are trapped under rubble, and medics continue wheeling people out of a hospital, begging the running citizens to help to no avail. One man decides to sit on the ground, giving up hope that they would be saved. Suddenly, Doldo broadcasts himself to the entire island. He reminds them that the shrinking Birdcage was not a dream, saying that they had been under a cage ever since Doflamingo had taken over ten years ago. However, every member of the Donquixote Pirates except Doflamingo himself had been taken down, and Luffy was currently fighting Doflamingo. Doldo tells the citizens that their nightmare would soon end, and urges them to keep running from the Birdcage no matter their condition, as there was still hope. This galvanizes the people, and the handicapped begin running again despite their ailments.

Lying on the ground and barely able to move, Luffy is targeted by Doflamingo and Jesus Burgess, who is after the Gomu Gomu no Mi.","Encouraged by Riku Doldo III's speech and by Luffy overpowering Doflamingo, the citizens of Dressrosa run away from the shrinking Birdcage in hopes of protecting their lives.

Luffy screams Doflamingo's name, and the Shichibukai nearly wraps him up in a mass of string, sending him bouncing uncontrollably across the street. Luffy continues dodging the strings, knowing he is running out of time. Doflamingo turns a large portion of town into strings, shocking the citizens, and directs them all to Luffy. Luffy barely manages to dodge the incoming strings and flies toward Doflamingo in anger, covering his head in Armament Haki.

He hits Doflamingo with both palms, and the force of the blow sends Doflamingo flying into the palace plateau.
The citizens, pirates, Marines, and gladiators react in shock to Luffy's move, as the pirate slowly falls down to the ground. The dust at the site of Doflamingo's impact clears, showing the unmoving Shichibukai. The citizens start celebrating Doflamingo's defeat while staring at Luffy, and one of them recognizes who the pirate is. However, one person is doubtful, as he does not resemble the person on newspapers, with another person thinking he was much taller. The citizens wonder about Luffy's constant bouncing and ask if he can stop, which he denies. Meanwhile, Gatz stares at Luffy and realizes that he is Lucy, the Block C winner in the Corrida Colosseum. Cavendish also celebrates Doflamingo's defeat, but Law realizes that the Birdcage is still up, meaning Doflamingo is still conscious. Luffy realizes this as well, and leaps back up into the air in order to give Doflamingo a final blow. He flies toward Doflamingo and readies a punch, but Gear 4's time limit expires before he can throw it, and the air exuded sends him crashing into the ground.
The citizens stare in shock at Luffy lying on the ground, and on the palace rooftop, Jesus Burgess laughs in delight. Burgess jumps from the roof and bounces on one of the spires on the Flower Field, shocking Cavendish, as he falls down to the streets below. Koala marvels at how far the pirate can jump as she calls Sabo on the Den Den Mushi, but gets no answer. Burgess lands on the street, and the citizens recognize him in fear as captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates. Burgess shouts his intentions to steal the Gomu Gomu no Mi from Luffy, who attempts to get up, but is too weak.

Some of the gladiators go to stall Doflamingo, but the Warlord easily overwhelms them.","Doflamingo causes part of the cliff around him to fall away, and the citizens of Dressrosa run from the falling rubble. They run past Luffy, who struggles to stay off the ground, and some stop by him, but run away due to not wanting to get involved with Doflamingo. Luffy falls to the ground once again, but is suddenly grabbed by Gatz, who recognizes him as the gladiator Lucy from Corrida Colosseum and asks Luffy if he remembers him. As Doflamingo causes more shockwaves in the palace plateau, Gatz asks if Luffy could continue his battle with Doflamingo, and the pirate replies that he needs ten minutes, as he could not use Armament Haki for ten minutes after using Gear 4. Doflamingo frees himself from the cliff face and gleefully looks at the fallen Luffy as he keeps repairing his internal organs, saying he had returned.
Gatz asks Luffy if he would free them from the Birdcage after ten minutes as Doflamingo descends to the streets. Luffy replies that if he could regain his Haki he would finish off Doflamingo in one blow, and Gatz calls a horde of gladiators toward him. These were the gladiators who went after the bounties Doflamingo put on Luffy and his allies instead of helping them, and Mummy, Meadows, and Rolling Logan apologize for being blinded by money. They promise to hold Doflamingo off while Luffy regained his Haki, and as Doflamingo reaches the ground, some of the gladiators confront him.

As they run, however, Jesus Burgess bursts through a building and brandishes his dagger, eager to kill Luffy. Gatz and the gladiators are frightened by his arrival, when suddenly he is kicked away by Sabo.
A short time earlier, Sabo was running toward Luffy, having known that his Haki was fading. In the present, Sabo holds his pipe to Burgess' neck as the gladiators recognize him. Sabo tells Burgess that he is in the Revolutionary Army and Luffy is his brother, and Burgess realizes that someone else said the same thing, which Sabo reveals to be Ace. Burgess gleefully remembers how Blackbeard defeated Ace on Banaro Island two years ago and started the Summit War. Sabo says that Ace made his own choices, but from now on he would be protecting Luffy. Amused, Burgess says that he has no business with Sabo or the Revolutionaries, as he sights Luffy but Sabo questions that statement as he lights the end of his finger on fire. Burgess realizes in shock that he was the one that ate the Mera Mera no Mi, and Sabo tells Luffy to go ahead and deal with Doflamingo while he takes care of Burgess. Luffy too realizes that Sabo ate the Mera Mera no Mi, and Sabo replies that he would not have let anyone else have it as the brothers smile at each other.
Gatz and the gladiators run off while Sabo confronts Burgess. Burgess swings his elbow at Sabo, the force of the blow toppling the building in front of him, but Sabo avoids the blow by turning into flames. Sabo hits Burgess twice, then combines his Devil Fruit and Ryusoken to send Burgess spinning far away while being roasted with flames. The gladiators are shocked that he did this to one of the Four Emperors' subordinates, and Sabo realizes that Burgess' goal was to hunt down Devil Fruit eaters as he heads toward Burgess. Meanwhile, Luffy tells a confused Gatz that Sabo took his place during the Colosseum finals. Gatz says that that was against the rules, but he was glad that the fruit ended up in their hands. Suddenly, an explosion occurs near Doflamingo's location, and Gatz looks back in shock as he sees Doflamingo massacring the gladiators with his awakened Devil Fruit abilities.

However, Luffy has four minutes before he regains his Haki, and the Birdcage will fully close in three.","The citizens of Dressrosa continue running from the Birdcage and Doflamingo, but become very crowded as the amount of space they have grows smaller and smaller. Some wonder why they are not going downtown to the center of the cage, but are told that a battle is going on there as Doflamingo continues attacking his opponents with awakened string. The citizens cry out to Riku Doldo III for help as he stands on a piece of rubble. On the palace plateau, the Corrida Colosseum gladiators have moved their fallen allies, who show no signs of stirring. Suddenly, a glowing orb falls down onto Hajrudin's chest, causing him to open his eyes.
Meanwhile, Zoro, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro reach the Birdcage, and Zoro covers two of his swords in Armament Haki. He clashes both swords against the Birdcage, shocking the samurai, who consider stopping the Birdcage to be impossible. However, Zoro tells them to stop talking and join him, and the samurai cover their swords in Haki and clash against the Birdcage. By the SMILE Factory, Franky tells the dwarves to push against the factory, as it would not be destroyed due to being made of Seastone, and the dwarves comply. Meanwhile, Robin talks with Viola, who reveals that Zoro is trying to stop the Birdcage.
At the south side of the palace plateau, the remaining Donquixote Pirates stand on a toppled building, preventing the citizens from going past them. The citizens beg for them to let them head up, as it is the safest place, but the lead pirate says that Doflamingo had condemned the citizens to die and shoots any who speak up against him. Suddenly, the gladiators arrive and defeat all the Donquixote Pirates, including the fallen ones. Kyros tells the citizens to head out, but Sai tells anyone able-bodied to come and follow him. Meanwhile, Doflamingo heads away from the carnage he has created and says that if Luffy would not come out, he would bring him out. Doflamingo holds his arm upward and clenches his fist, causing the Birdcage to start moving faster. The citizens know this and run in panic, but have difficulty due to being packed so tight. Doldo notices this as well, and the citizens beg him to help, but all he can do is despair and beg Doflamingo to stop.
Sabo and Burgess continue their clash, and Burgess attacks with Armament Haki, but Sabo counters by engulfing his staff in flames. Sabo then covers his legs in flames and kicks Burgess before smashing his staff into the pirate's chest. Burgess struggles to overcome the heat of the flames as he gets back up, and Sabo notices the Birdcage constricting faster. Viola and Law notice this as well, and Zoro, Franky, the samurai, and the dwarves struggle to keep up with the increased speed. Suddenly, Fujitora notices bright orbs falling around him.

Doflamingo then takes control of Rebecca and forces her to attack her aunt, as 60 seconds remain before Luffy regains his Haki.","The citizens of Dressrosa are bewildered when their injuries are healed, but only care about getting away from the shrinking Birdcage. Suddenly, Hack and Usopp appear above them on a piece of rubble, and the citizens are shocked to see Usopp, wondering what he did to receive his five-star bounty. Usopp says that his friends are pushing the Birdcage and tells any able-bodied citizen to go help them. The stunned citizens say that such a feat is impossible, but Usopp gets angry and tells them to go, and the citizens become scared of his perceived power and obey his orders.

As Luffy continues recovering with Law guarding him, Doflamingo slashes Spartan in the chest. With all the gladiators defeated, Doflamingo shouts for Luffy to show himself. However, Spartan grabs Doflamingo's leg, saying that he was still alive, but Doflamingo shoots him and steps on his head. Some other gladiators get back up in order to distract Doflamingo as long as possible, with one of them grabbing the Shichibukai from behind in order to keep him immobilized. As the others rush toward him, however, Doflamingo stabs all of them with sheets of string. Viola watches this as she runs through the city, and Doflamingo's brutality visibly stuns her. Meanwhile, a large crowd forms in the center of town, but Rebecca tells the citizens to head for the palace since the center of the Birdcage is moving in that direction.
The citizens comply, but Rebecca knows that as long as Doflamingo remains alive, the efforts to stop the Birdcage may be in vain. Picking up a sword left by one of the fallen gladiators, she decides to confront Doflamingo herself and try to bring an end to the cage. However, she sees Viola confronting Doflamingo, and Viola asks Rebecca why she came. She tells her niece that she could not face Kyros or Scarlett if Rebecca was killed and says that as a former officer of the Donquixote Pirates it was her responsibility to bring Doflamingo down. Viola casts off her cape and hairpins as she brandishes a knife and prepares to engage in a fight to the death. She rushes at Doflamingo, but the Shichibukai easily dodges her stabs and kicks before kicking her to the ground.
At the SMILE Factory, Franky and the dwarves continue pushing on it, while nearby, Zoro, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro keep pushing the Birdcage with their swords. Zoro thinks that it is slowing down, which Kanjuro initially agrees with, but the samurai quickly changes his mind. Suddenly, Fujitora walks forward, shocking Zoro, and the admiral unsheathes his sword. Zoro thinks he is about to attack, but Fujitora instead clashes his sword against the Birdcage, saying he would do what little he could to help. A procession of Marines then arrives, with the ones who could use Haki joining Fujitora and the ones who could not joining Franky and the dwarves at the factory. As the Marines help push the factory, nearby citizens are encouraged to push it as well, and more citizens help the gladiators push Bartolomeo's barrier on the other side of the island. Kyros recalls telling Rebecca to guide the citizens. Eventually, their titanic effort causes the cage to briefly come to a standstill. However, it quickly starts moving again, and they resume pushing, but now have hope that it can be stopped. Riku Doldo III and Tank Lepanto join the effort at the SMILE Factory, with the former king praising the citizens' efforts.
Viola stands up and attacks Doflamingo with whale-shaped tears, but Doflamingo easily blocks the attack and grabs her by the wrist.

An angered Doflamingo impales Gatz and then forces Rebecca to attack Viola. However, Luffy regains his Haki and blocks Rebecca's attack as he confronts Doflamingo again.","The citizens of Dressrosa run toward the palace plateau and help each other climb it, and Gatz climbs up a different part of the cliff. Meanwhile, Zoro, the samurai, and the Marines push on the Birdcage with their swords, all of them convicted to help Luffy and to honor their organizations. Franky, the dwarves, and various citizens continue pushing the SMILE Factory, and the gladiators push Bartolomeo's barrier. Bartolomeo reminds them that they are inching closer to death and it is up to them to prevent this, but they reply that he does not need to tell them this. Sai is proud of his comrades for their spirit, and Hajrudin states that he does not want to die here because he has a dream he wants to achieve. Bartolomeo then says to keep pushing until their bodies break. Meanwhile, Mansherry continues flying over the city releasing her Chiyupopo into the air, and hopes that everyone will be safe. At the palace plateau, Gatz pulls himself up on a platform, breathing heavily from the effort.
Down below, Doflamingo continues forcing Rebecca to head toward them with the intention of making her kill Viola. Rebecca grows more and more distressed at her powerlessness, and Viola begs Doflamingo to stop, to no avail. Suddenly, Gatz's voice rings out across the island, causing Doflamingo and the citizens to look up at him in bewilderment. The citizens recognize him and tell him to stop fooling around, but Gatz tells them to remember a star that fought in the Corrida Colosseum earlier that day. Cavendish thinks that he is the star and prepares to head out, but suddenly realizes that Law is gone. Gatz talks about Luffy's accomplishments in the Colosseum, which the citizens remember, and reveals that the star was indeed Lucy, or as he was better known, Monkey D. Luffy. Gatz acknowledges that the country may not be so quick to trust a pirate after what happened with Doflamingo, but assures them that Luffy is not like Doflamingo. He says that Luffy was called their hope by Riku Doldo III and earlier fought Doflamingo to within an inch of defeat, which causes some of the citizens to place their hope in Luffy and trust him despite apparently being betrayed ten years ago. Gatz follows up by telling the crowd that despite Luffy being knocked out, he promised earlier that he would defeat Doflamingo in one blow, which causes the crowd to cheer.
The fighters pushing the Birdcage react gleefully to the proclamation, and Zoro states that they could not hold out much longer otherwise. As the crowd continues cheering, Gatz builds up his courage and turns to Doflamingo, condemning his actions and proclaiming that this is where he will meet his punishment. Gatz trembles, not caring what Doflamingo did to him, but only desires the Shichibukai to get away from Viola and Rebecca. Gatz congratulates the people on Dressrosa for helping hold off the Birdcage and says that their salvation would come shortly. The people pushing the Birdcage renew their efforts, but the ones revived by the Chiyupopo begin collapsing due to its effects wearing off. Leo states that it will not work twice, and Mansherry begins crying in sadness that she gave the people false hope. However, Kabu tells her that countless people would have died if it were not for her efforts. Mansherry begins smiling again as more people run to help stop the Birdcage, and Gatz proclaims that Luffy will return in ten seconds.
Encouraged by Gatz, the citizens start chanting ""Lucy"" as Luffy attempts to get up. When the countdown reaches two, Doflamingo impales Gatz with a sheet of string, causing him to collapse. However, Gatz urges the people to keep counting, and his Den Den Mushi speaker falls and rings out as the countdown reaches zero. Nothing happens, and the crowd wonders where Luffy is. Doflamingo states that Luffy is not coming and forces Rebecca to run toward her aunt and kill her. Viola tells Rebecca to close her eyes and pretend this was a bad dream; she would not hold a grudge on her. Viola silently apologizes to Rebecca as her niece begins breaking down, but before she can land the blow, Luffy appears in Viola's place and takes the blow with a Haki-imbued forehead, which snaps the blade in half. Viola appears in Luffy's place due to Law switching the two of them, and Gatz alerts the people of Dressrosa that Luffy has returned as they cheer on the Straw Hat Captain. Luffy then turns to face Doflamingo once again.","Gatz, Roronoa Zoro, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, Issho, Franky, Elizabello II, Blue Gilly, Chinjao, Ideo, Bartolomeo, Hajrudin, Nico Robin, Boo, Dagama, Sai, Baby 5, Kabu, Mansherry, Donquixote Doflamingo, Viola, Rebecca, Kyros, Cavendish, Monkey D.

Episode 733,Attack on a Celestial - Luffy's King Kong Gun of Anger,20-Mar-16,"As their battle resumes, Doflamingo relentlessly attacks Luffy with string and takes control of him. However, Luffy breaks free by activating Gear 4 and flies into the air, where he makes his fist even larger. He then breaks through Doflamingo's defenses and sends the Shichibukai flying through the ground.","The people on Dressrosa cheer Luffy on as he returns to battle Doflamingo, and Gatz tells him to knock the Shichibukai out in one blow. Doflamingo commends Luffy's entrance but knows that he just got his Haki back and is likely at his limits. Luffy replies that Doflamingo is also near defeat, and Doflamingo hits Luffy with his string pillars, sending him crashing to the ground. Rebecca turns toward him, only for Doflamingo to attack her next. However, Law switches Rebecca out with a rock, taking her to his location as Doflamingo destroys the rock. Doflamingo notices Law and tells him to watch as his hope gets crushed. Doflamingo turns the ground Luffy is lying on into string, bouncing him around before binding his body with string. Doflamingo then summons many blades of string and sends them all at Luffy, who struggles to block them with Armament Haki. However, one of the blades succeeds in impaling Luffy, and Doflamingo asks him if he really regained his Haki as he sends Luffy flying into a rock face before hitting him with all his string blades.
Gatz and the citizens are stunned by the battle, wondering what happened. However, the Birdcage remains up, and the gladiators, pirates, and Marines continue pushing it with the hope that Luffy would hurry and defeat Doflamingo. Meanwhile, Luffy lies down inside a cave created by the impact, and cannot get up. Suddenly, Doflamingo attaches strings to him and forces him to stand up and walk toward him. As Doflamingo controls Luffy like a puppet, Luffy remembers sitting at a campfire with Silvers Rayleigh during his training. He had lost to his opponent and barely escaped death, and Rayleigh asked him what happened to his Kong Gun. Luffy replied that this opponent was too big for the Kong Gun to work on, and Rayleigh told him that he needed to come up with something else. As he walks toward Doflamingo, Luffy realizes that the Shichibukai was also too powerful for the Kong Gun.
Doflamingo tells Luffy that they should have all just stayed in his cage and submitted to his manipulation, saying that humans should only live when a divine being like him manipulates them. He says that he would not have had to carry out this massacre if they had not cut their puppet strings, but Luffy has had enough with his talk. The Birdcage cuts farther into the King's Plateau and continues cutting through buildings, and Luffy's allies tell him to hurry up. Leo grows worried about what will happen if the Birdcage keeps advancing, but Robin tells him to trust in Luffy. Meanwhile, Luffy raises up his arm and blows into it, reactivating Gear 4 and breaking Doflamingo's control on him.
Although shocked that Luffy broke his strings, Doflamingo wonders how long Luffy can maintain Gear 4 in this state. Luffy then takes to the air, which amuses Doflamingo as he and his strings rise up and follow him. Doflamingo catches up to Luffy, expressing annoyance that the pirate was above him and promising to drag him down and control him like a puppet again. Luffy replies that he felt like he was suffocating due to Doflamingo manipulating everyone, and the Shichibukai says that the people here were born as trash and are meant to be manipulated. Luffy tells him to be quiet as he retracts his forearm, and Doflamingo creates a web to protect himself. Luffy then blows air into his other arm, making the retracted arm even bigger, as he remembers sharing his idea for an improved Kong Gun with Rayleigh. Doflamingo is surprised by this as he sends 16 bullets of string at Luffy, who unleashes his new attack, the King Kong Punch, downward. The clash between Luffy and the strings is powerful enough to cause ripples in the water and be felt by the citizens below, and everyone on Dressrosa cheers Luffy on as he breaks through Doflamingo's attack and defense before hitting Doflamingo himself. The force of the punch sends Doflamingo flying into the ground, with the impact tearing apart the city, and Doflamingo falls down into the underground harbor. Law remembers Corazon telling him about how the Family of D. is the sworn enemy of the gods as Doflamingo's shattered glasses fall away and Luffy hovers in the air victorious.","Monkey D.

Episode 734,To Be Free! Dressrosa's Delight!,27-Mar-16,"Everyone on Dressrosa rejoices at Doflamingo's defeat as the Birdcage disappears. As Luffy loses consciousness, the people remember their suffering at the hands of Doflamingo, and Kyros sheds human tears for the first time in ten years.","The citizens of Dressrosa run away from the parts of the city sent flying by Doflamingo's impact with the ground, and Rebecca stares up at Luffy in awe. She remembers meeting Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum by the statue of Kyros and later revealing her intention to kill Doflamingo at the prisoner gladiators' cell. Next to her, Viola remembers submitting herself to Doflamingo ten years ago in order to save her father's life, and when the Straw Hats came to Dressrosa ten years later, she told him that she would trust in the Straw Hats despite them being pirates. Luffy's Gear 4 form wears off, with the exhaled air blowing him all over the place. Law switches Luffy out with a rock, teleporting the pirate to his location. Viola and Rebecca are relieved to see that Luffy is fine.
In the underground harbor, a defeated Doflamingo lies motionless on the ground, with his shattered sunglasses next to him. The citizens of Dressrosa notice that no one is in the air anymore, and they tell Gatz to announce the winner. Gatz picks up his Den Den Mushi despite his attendants telling him not to exert himself, and tells everyone to look up. They see in amazement that the Birdcage is disappearing from the tip downward, and Gatz asks if they are seeing their freedom from the Birdcage or from Doflamingo's domination. Two men remember being forced to work as toys in the underground harbor, and another remembers his girlfriend not recognizing him after he was turned into a toy. The Birdcage disappears completely, causing the people pushing it (except Nico Robin, Fujitora, and the Marines) to fall forward. Giving a final push, the dwarves cause the SMILE Factory to topple over. The combatants look up in wonder at the sun emerging through the nonexistent cage.
Gatz gives his audience the details of the battle and the combatants on both sides, but struggles through his tears to announce the winner. Riku Doldo III remembers Doflamingo tricking the people and usurping the throne ten years ago and begins to cry, much like Rebecca who cries onto Luffy's face as she remembers Luffy's promise to save Kyros and defeat Doflamingo. Finally, Gatz proclaims that the winner is Luffy, causing everyone on Dressrosa to cheer. As he embraces the Tontattas, Franky remembers how they and Kyros were working to expose Doflamingo's secret agendas and bring down the Shichibukai. As this goes on, Kyros heads off, remembering how he lost his leg and was turned into a toy, causing everyone he loved to forget about him and preventing him from feeling Scarlett's warmth as she died. After being unable to cry for ten years as a toy, Kyros bawls as the people rejoice and cry among the rubble despite their country having collapsed.","Donquixote Doflamingo, Monkey D.

Meanwhile, the Marines arrest all of the Donquixote Pirates except for Viola, Baby 5, and Bellamy. Maynard broadcasts the destruction on Dressrosa to three neighboring islands, and as this occurs, the people of Dressrosa beg Riku Doldo III to return to the throne. Doldo keeps refusing until Elizabello II backs up the citizens' plea, and Fujitora then arrives with a platoon of Marines. As multitudes of people watch, Fujitora and the Marines fall prostrate before Doldo in apology for the World Government allowing Doflamingo to rule over Dressrosa. The record of this is kept, and soon news of Doflamingo's defeat at the hand of Luffy and Law's alliance is spread all over the world.","The citizens of Dressrosa continue celebrating Doflamingo's defeat as Gatz tearfully states that he never expected Doflamingo to be defeated like this before hanging up his Den Den Mushi. Sabo is happily viewing the emerging sun as well, and walks away from a defeated Burgess. Burgess wonders why Sabo is not going to finish him off, but Sabo feels no need to. However, Burgess tells Sabo that Ace said something to them during his defeat on Banaro Island as Sabo's Den Den Mushi rings. His fellow members of the Revolutionary Army impatiently wait in the underground harbor for him to pick up their call, but one states that Sabo only answers when he feels like it. Burgess tells Sabo that Ace told them not to tell his brother about his defeat, as he knew what the Marines would do to him. However, Sabo grabs Burgess' head and places it in a tight grip as he replies that he knows that already and is not interested in revenge. Burgess holds his dagger behind his back, determined to get the Mera Mera no Mi lest he lose his reputation, and questions Sabo about the regret he felt for not being around to try to save Ace before attacking the revolutionary with his dagger. However, Sabo easily dodges the blow and states that that is why he did not want any more regrets before incinerating Burgess with Hiken. As Burgess flies far away, Sabo answers his Den Den Mushi, where Koala reveals that they are ready to go and are just waiting for him. Sabo asks if she got the list, which she affirms, but hangs up abruptly, causing Koala to punch the revolutionary holding the Den Den Mushi.
Meanwhile, the Marines scour Dressrosa, looking for the Donquixote Pirates. All of them are located, sans Bellamy, and the Marines are warned that many of the officers are Devil Fruit users and told to bind them with seastone. As they watch all the lower-ranked pirates being led away, Sai and Chinjao remark that this marks the true end of Doflamingo's crew, and Sai tells Baby 5 to stay with him, which she gladly complies with. As the Marines bind Doflamingo with seastone chains, one Marine asks another if they had reported this to Marine Headquarters. The other responds that Admiral Fujitora actually told them to not file a report yet. Meanwhile, Maynard stands on a pile of rubble above ground and is told that his Den Den Mushi is ready, and Maynard tells his men to take another one and follow Fujitora like they were ordered. As Fujitora walks through the streets with a platoon of Marines, Maynard broadcasts himself to Applenine Island and two other islands close to Dressrosa. He reveals that the wreckage he is standing on is what Doflamingo did to Dressrosa today, and tells the people on the neighboring islands to spread the word about the Shichibukai's actions.
Elsewhere, the citizens of Dressrosa surround Riku Doldo III and beg him to return to the throne, having found out that they were tricked ten years ago. Doldo adamantly refuses, saying that his family's pacifist philosophy would only lead to ruin if something like Doflamingo comes around again. However, the people respond that they will willing take that as well as the poverty they used to be in in order to regain the peace they once had. Suddenly, Elizabello II arrives, saying that as a fighting king this cry for peace irked him. Just then, one of Doldo’s subordinates comes running to alert him that the Den Den Mushi in the palace will not stop ringing. Elizabello explains that he has already informed the neighbouring countries that Doldo will return to the throne. He further corroborates with the citizens that he wants him to once more rule Dressrosa. He also states that he wishes Doldo will act tough in order to turn away opposing countries like he once did before. Suddenly, Fujitora and the Marines reach Doldo, and the Admiral's arrival shocks the citizens of Dressrosa and the neighboring islands watching the broadcast of this. Fujitora tells Doldo that the World Government allowed Doflamingo to take over Dressrosa because he was a Shichibukai. Fujitora and the Marines then fall prostrate before Doldo in apology for their actions, shocking everyone watching.

Episode 736,Sending a Shock Wave - The Worst Generation Goes Into Action!,10-Apr-16,"The Straw Hats reunite after the battle on Dressrosa, and Kyros disbands the Tontatta army. In Mary Geoise, Sakazuki meets with the Five Elders, angry about Doflamingo's deception earlier in the day. He and the Five Elders are then told about Doflamingo's defeat, shocking them. As the news about Doflamingo's defeat is carried all over the world, people that relied on Doflamingo's Underworld brokering lose their resources, and some get angry at Luffy and Law.
Jewelry Bonney and the alliance of Eustass Kid, Killer, Scratchmen Apoo, and Basil Hawkins read the news, and the alliance is glad that Luffy and Law are after Kaidou and not their target, Shanks. On a sky island, Urouge recovers from his wounds, when he is approached by a mysterious man.
On Dressrosa, Fujitora and Sakazuki get into an argument over the Den Den Mushi over Fujitora telling the world about Doflamingo's defeat so quickly. At sea, Smoker expresses relief that Fujitora got the truth out unlike he did during Crocodile's defeat. Sakazuki tells Fujitora that he can never set foot in a Marine base until he captures Luffy and Law, which Fujitora agrees to.","The people on Dressrosa and the neighboring islands receiving the Marines' broadcast are still bewildered by Admiral Fujitora's prostration before Riku Doldo III. Doldo tells Fujitora to get up and asks if he really wanted the whole world to see this, but the Admiral refuses, saying that he left the Straw Hats to do everything in hopes that they would succeed. The Marines had done nothing because of Doflamingo's Shichibukai status, and Fujitora wants to make it clear that this was not the Marines' victory.
Meanwhile, Usopp runs through the streets with Robin and Bartolomeo, looking for Luffy. He runs into Zoro, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Franky, who note that he is standing up once again, which Usopp claims to be from the excitement of Luffy's victory. On a nearby rooftop sit Luffy, Law, Rebecca, and Viola, and the latter states that they should let the Straw Hats know where they are. Elsewhere, Kyros faces all the Tontattas that had taken part in the fight against Doflamingo. He thanks them for their work and disbands the anti-Doflamingo army before saluting them, which causes them to cry tears of joy. Kyros reminds them that they are the guardian deities of Dressrosa and still had work to do to make Dressrosa beautiful once again. The Tontattas all begin to cheer and embrace Kyros. Meanwhile, the Marines have gotten back up and the transmission has been cut off, and Riku tells Tank Lepanto to shelter the pirates and homeless people in the palace.
In Mary Geoise, Sakazuki confronts the Five Elders and questions why Doflamingo's deception earlier in the day had to take place, saying that it brought shame to him as the Fleet Admiral. The Five Elders silenced him, saying that his pride did not matter and that they left the situation to Cipher Pol. Sakazuki remarks that the Five Elders are acting like puppets of the World Nobles, and they angrily bring up Kuzan, stating that him joining the Blackbeard Pirates was a great stain on the Marines. Right then, another Marine comes running up, reporting that Doflamingo had been defeated and Dressrosa is currently in a state of destruction. Sakazuki and the Five Elders are appalled that Luffy and Law managed to do such a thing.
As the news of Doflamingo's defeat spreads across the world, a king of a country states that with this event, they no longer had access to weapons, and that they would have to surrender. White flags go up, and on the sea, a pirate crew also laments their access to weapons ending. One pirate decides to go to Dressrosa and get them himself, but is reminded that a Marine Admiral is still there. Another pirate crew is upset their Devil Fruit access has been cut off. Meanwhile, a gang laments that their access to SMILE has been cut off, and they stab the newspaper photos of Luffy and Law in anger. Somewhere at sea, Tsuru converses with a Marine Inspector General about Doflamingo's defeat, and the Inspector General offers her okaki.
On another island, Jewelry Bonney turns into an old woman and steals a piece of pizza, but turns into a child immediately after, causing the angry shopkeeper to overlook her. Bonney reads the news, saying that she is glad she is in the same generation as Luffy and Law. On a sky island, Urouge is recovering from his wounds as his crewmates tend to him. Some of them race toward him, revealing that someone is coming. Urouge blows this off, saying that they are on a lonely sky island. Suddenly, the ground begins to shake as large footsteps fall on it, and Urouge watches in shock as a giant man with horns approaches him. On the Big Mom Pirates' ship, Capone Bege takes note of Luffy and Law's actions before saying to his crewmates that they would get Caesar Clown back at any cost. At the Kid Pirates' hideout, the allied pirates Eustass Kid, Killer, Scratchmen Apoo, and Basil Hawkins discuss Law and Luffy's victory, realizing that Doflamingo is connected to Kaidou and that by defeating the former the alliance seeks to take down the latter. Killer is glad that the alliances' targets are different, as their alliance is targeting Shanks. On a wintery island, some pirates under Kaidou ask X Drake about Doflamingo killing his father. Drake affirms this, but states that he does not hold a grudge. The pirates then shout to Kaidou about Doflamingo's defeat, knowing he would be angry that SMILE production has ceased.
On Dressrosa, Fujitora argues with Sakazuki over Den Den Mushi, and the force of their voices causes the nearby Marines to tremble in fear. Sakazuki reprimands Fujitora for not reporting to him first, but Fujitora replies that Sakazuki would have altered the story in some way. He remembers speaking with Smoker on a ship, with the Vice Admiral having told him about how Luffy took down Crocodile two years ago but that the World Government credited him instead in order to save face. In the present, a recovering Smoker reads the news and expresses his relief to Tashigi that Fujitora managed to do what he did not. The giant children then peek into the door, wanting food and wondering when they would get to Vegapunk, and Tashigi tells them that the journey will take a few more days. On Dressrosa, Sakazuki argues that cover-ups were needed in order to save face for the government, but Fujitora replies that their credibility is nonexistent if it could be shattered that easily, and the Marines get scared about Fujitora's attitude toward the Fleet Admiral. Sakazuki then orders Fujitora to capture Luffy and Law, or he would never be allowed on a Marine base again. As a sleeping Luffy is placed on the back of one of Kanjuro's birds, Fujitora replies that that is what he wanted to hear.","Riku Doldo III, Issho, Elizabello II, Tank Lepanto, Monkey D.

Sabo arrives soon after to see Luffy and reveals to those still awake that he is Luffy's brother. Sabo then reveals CP0 is searching for the revolutionaries and they have to leave soon, advising the Straw Hats to also leave soon. He tells the crew of his past with Luffy and Ace and also what happened to him after he was presumed dead.
The Dressrosa palace has begun repair works and the Corrida Colosseum fighters rest there.
After Sabo tells the crew his story, Franky asks how he got back his memories, to which Sabo replies that Ace's death awakened his memory.","On a hill in Carta lies Kyros' house, where Kyros, the Straw Hats, Law, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bellamy rest and recover from their injuries. Kyros explains why he lives here and offers the group anything they may need, and Kin'emon asks why Bellamy is with them, to which Law replies that Luffy knows him so he brought him along. Kyros, Usopp, and Law fall asleep from exhaustion, and the door of the house begins opening. Zoro tenses up at the intrusion, but the person entering turns out to be Sabo, who throws Zoro a drink. Robin happily greets him as Zoro asks how she knows him to which she introduces Sabo as Luffy's brother which surprises Franky and Zoro. Sabo approaches Luffy, and Robin goes to wake him up, but Sabo states that she does not need to do that. Franky asks if he is leaving soon, which Sabo affirms, revealing that CP0 is heading for them. The Straw Hats prepare to leave soon as well, but wonder why Luffy never told them about having another brother. Sabo reveals that he was presumed deceased for a long time after getting into an accident.
Twelve years ago, in Goa Kingdom, a ten-year-old Sabo asked about the country's plan to set fire to Gray Terminal. However, he was shocked to receive callous remarks about a plan that would kill many people. Sabo ran to warn Ace and Luffy, but he ended up beaten and lying in an alleyway. He was approached by Monkey D. Dragon, and told the mysterious man about his contempt for the town and his status. Feeling trapped, Sabo decided to set out to sea, but encountered a ship much larger than his small vessel. The large ship contained the World Noble Jalmack, who shot Sabo's ship with a bazooka due to it crossing his path. Sabo desperately tried putting out the flames, but the second shot completely destroyed his ship, sending his tattered hat flying into the water.
Barely alive and with an injury around his left eye, Sabo sunk into the depths of the ocean, but was saved in the nick of time as Dragon grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the water. On a ship belonging to the Revolutionary Army, Emporio Ivankov and the revolutionaries grew anxious about when Dragon would return. Dragon then arrived with Sabo in his arms, and the ship's doctor was called. Sabo eventually woke up surrounded by revolutionaries. One of them asked if his name was Sabo due to it being written on his possessions, but Sabo had no memory of his name or anything at all. Another revolutionary decided that they should take him home and find his parents, but Sabo refused, having a bad feeling about his family despite not remembering them. Ivankov stated that they can't let him stay here, and Sabo replied that they could take him somewhere else. Dragon and Bartholomew Kuma then approached, and Ivankov asked Dragon what they should do.
In the present day, laborers work on rebuilding the palace as the Corrida Colosseum gladiators are taken to a room inside, with the worker promising them asylum from the Marines and a doctor. Boo wonders if there will be a banquet, but is told that it will be later. The gladiators prepare to go to sleep, especially Cavendish, but Bartolomeo knows what will happen if he goes to sleep. He tells people to bring him a chain, which he uses to wrap around Cavendish, telling the outraged gladiator that they will see a monster if they do not do this.
At Kyros' house, the Straw Hats ask Sabo if that was how he joined the Revolutionary Army, and Sabo replies that it was sort of like that. 12 years ago, Sabo trained on Baltigo with several children under Hack, but broke off from the exercise. Sabo told Hack that he was going to train himself before running off, and Hack told Ivankov that Sabo had a lot of fighting experience which his body still remembered. The days passed, with Sabo training and studying intensely. One day, Sabo fought Hack and succeeded in removing the fish-man's belt, causing his pants to fall down. He was then approached by Kuma, and was excited to fight him next, but was easily blown away. Meanwhile, Ace and Luffy sat on the coast Dawn Island, promising to get stronger and become pirates at age 17. Two years later, Sabo peeled potatoes with Koala, but was exasperated when they were given another box. He decided to break into the apples and eat them, but was reprimanded by Koala. Later, he fought Kuma once again, who sent him flying into a pile of boxes. However, Sabo discovered a pipe inside the wreckage, and he used it to vault off Kuma and attack Dragon. Dragon avoided Sabo's blow and knocked him out, but commended his fighting ability.
Seven years later, Ace set out to sea to become a pirate, and the Revolutionary Army is engaged in battle with a military fortress. Hack and Koala sat helpless in the trenches, wondering what the people sneaking in first were doing. Right then, Sabo called them, briefly stating that he would figure something out before hanging up. Sabo then appeared right in front of the entrance and ran toward it despite enemy fire. He hardened his arm with Armament Haki and broke down the door, entering the fortress with ease. Sabo dispatched the enemy soldiers as the other revolutionaries freed the captured citizens and allies, and as he was surrounded, Sabo completely destroyed the fortress by using Ryusoken. At Baltigo, Sabo was commended for the victory, and a revolutionary talked about a rookie around Sabo's age who refused to join the Shichibukai. He began to say Ace's name, but Sabo completed it, stunning them. However, Sabo could not remember what he said. Three years later, Luffy headed out to sea and faced Lord of the Coast as a 20-year-old Sabo went to sea as well.

Episode 738,The Brothers' Bond - The Untold Story Behind Luffy and Sabo's Reunion,24-Apr-16,"Sabo tells Zoro, Robin, Franky, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro about how he regained his memories two years ago after hearing of Ace's death. Two years later, he visited Ace's grave and got permission to participate in the match for the Mera Mera no Mi, where he reunited with Luffy. Sabo then gives a Vivre Card of Luffy to the Straw Hats.
Meanwhile, Fujitora decides on a dice roll that he will not arrest the Straw Hats tonight, and at the palace, Riku Doldo III tells Rebecca that when he becomes king she will be a princess.","Two years ago, a 20-year-old Sabo sat atop the mast of a ship, when he suddenly saw faint outlines of Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace as children standing with their backs to him, though due to his amnesia he could not tell who they were. Luffy and Ace said Sabo's name and turned to face him, but Sabo was snapped out of his vision by Koala, who was excited that they would be returning to Baltigo for the first time in a month. Inside the headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, the revolutionaries said that Sabo and Koala came at the right time as everyone was reading about the outcome of the Summit War of Marineford. After it was wondered whether Emporio Ivankov was all right, a revolutionary revealed that Whitebeard and Portgas D. Ace had been killed, which shocked Sabo greatly. While Dragon confirmed to his subordinates that Luffy was indeed his son, Sabo began sweating as he read the news report about Ace's death. He remembered being with Ace as a child, as Ace declared that he would become Pirate King regardless of what anyone thought of him, and Sabo began crying and bending over in shock. He then remembered the time when he, Ace, and Luffy exchanged sake cups and became brothers, and his convulsions were starting to attract the other revolutionaries' attention. Sabo finally let out a large scream as he regained his memories and realized who Ace truly was, and collapsed in the process as the other revolutionaries ran to him.
After having another vision of Ace as a child, Sabo woke up with Koala and Hack at his side, and Koala began sobbing as she revealed how worried she was due to Sabo sleeping for three straight days. Sabo revealed that he indeed regained his memories, and Koala asked if he would quit the Revolutionary Army. Sabo denied this, but asked to speak with Dragon. In the present, Franky, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro well up in tears at the story, and the samurai indulge in the meat and alcohol, which Zoro berates them for. Knowing that they will need a lot of food to sustain themselves, Kin'emon and Kanjuro decide to go grocery shopping later. Franky then asks to hear the rest of the story, which Sabo complies with.
Before heading to Dressrosa, Sabo visited the graves of Ace and Whitebeard, pouring three sake cups on Ace's grave and talking about Luffy. As he walked away, Sabo contacted Koala via Den Den Mushi and asked for permission to obtain a certain Devil Fruit. Later, inside the Corrida Colosseum on Dressrosa, Luffy needed to get outside in order to rescue Law, and Bartolomeo promised to get the Mera Mera no Mi for him. However, Sabo walked up and said that he could not let either of them get the fruit. Bartolomeo angrily confronted him, but Sabo pushed him aside, saying he knew Luffy from way back. Luffy also became confrontational over Sabo's statement, not knowing who was before him. Sabo addressed him as Luffy and stated that he could tell his brother's face even in disguise, which caused Luffy to realize who he was. Luffy was taken aback by the realization and ran into the wall behind him, and Sabo shared the memory of them drinking sake cups, causing Luffy to wrap himself around his brother's head. Luffy began bawling as he asked Sabo where he had been all this time, and Sabo said that he is glad Luffy is alive. Luffy cried out that he had let Ace die, but Sabo was simply happy that Luffy was still there and that he was not alone, thanking Luffy for surviving. Luffy collapsed to the ground and Sabo asked if he could eat the Mera Mera no Mi, which Luffy agreed to.
In the present, the sleeping Luffy cracks open a smile, causing his crewmates to be happy. Sabo states that he is leaving now, and gives the Straw Hats a Vivre Card of Luffy, though keeps a piece for himself. Sabo knows that Luffy's crewmates should keep an eye on him, and they warmly remember that Ace said the same thing on Arabasta two years ago. As he walks outside, Sabo gets a call on Den Den Mushi, and he tells Hack on the other end that he is headed back before hanging up abruptly, causing Hack to punch at the operator. Meanwhile, Fujitora rolls a one on his die, which by the Marines' agreement was the only number in Luffy and Law's favor, meaning they would not go after them tonight. Maynard attempts to argue, but Fujitora says that his criticism in the face of a chance outcome is shameful. At the Dressrosa Royal Palace, the citizens and Colosseum gladiators sleep in a room, and Rebecca runs outside to where Riku Doldo III is. She asks her grandfather where Luffy and his group are, and Doldo replies that they are with Kyros. Doldo then tells Rebecca that if he becomes king again, she will become a princess, shocking her. Meanwhile, Sabo flies through the air on a flock of birds, excited to get back to Baltigo and talk to Dragon about Luffy and happy that he got to meet Luffy.","Sabo, Monkey D. Luffy, Portgas D.

Episode 739,The Strongest Creature - Emperor - Kaidou of the Beasts,1-May-16,"Kyros wakes up and he shares a drink with Zoro as he states his gratefulness to the Straw Hats for freeing everyone on Dressrosa.
Meanwhile, the crew on the Thousand Sunny arrives at a mysterious island. Sanji forces Caesar Clown to help a group of people as Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke battle against the pirate Sheepshead. Sanji defeats Sheepshead, and Sheepshead's allies decide to call off their mission to find a samurai and leave the island.
Meanwhile, a mysterious person lands on the Kid Pirates' base after having jumped off a Sky Island moments before. The person is revealed to be Kaidou, who faces Kid's alliance and declares that he wants to start a massive war.","At Kyros' house, Zoro and Robin remark on the bond Luffy has with Sabo, and Franky is in tears after hearing Sabo's story, causing him to short-circuit. Kyros then gets up, revealing that he heard Sabo's story from halfway through. He offers the Straw Hats a drink, his hospitality toward them being in gratitude for them freeing Dressrosa. Robin and Franky fall asleep as Zoro drinks a bottle of alcohol, saying that he would like to spar with Kyros someday. Kyros is pleased by the compliment, and Zoro hands the rest of the drink to him as he falls asleep in his chair. Kyros looks outside toward the palace and thinks of Rebecca, remembering how he met her in the Corrida Colosseum earlier that day when he was still a toy, and Rebecca told him that she wanted to live with him. Kyros then grimly writes a letter and heads outside with it toward the palace.
Meanwhile, the Thousand Sunny has docked at a mysterious island, and on it Caesar Clown berates Sanji for getting them involved in another situation right after they escaped from the Big Mom Pirates, saying they should have stayed on the ship. Sanji orders Caesar to do something, using his heart as leverage and beating him up further when the scientist stubbornly refuses. Chopper then arrives, telling Caesar to help them save a group of people. Caesar still refuses, until Chopper finally grabs him angrily and says that the people will die if they do not get help. Elsewhere on the island, Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke run, having been separated from the others. Nami struggles to keep her footing on the island's ground, and falls on top of Brook, who attempts to catch her. They are then confronted by two pirates, Sheepshead and Ginrummy, who want to know what they did with a girl. Suddenly, the Eruption Rain begins as water erupts from a mountainous object, causing the island to become flooded. Nami is forced to save Brook and Momonosuke, who are both Devil Fruit eaters, from drowning, and pulls them up on a branch.
However, Sheepshead and Ginrummy ride their crocodile-like steed through the water, and Sheepshead jumps at the Straw Hats from behind. However, Brook intercepts his sword slash, and Sheepshead gets away from Brook as he turns his hands into sheep's horns, shocking the Straw Hats. Brook intercepts Sheepshead's next attack with Soul Solid, and Sanji tells Brook to keep his defense as he comes flying in, defeating Sheepshead with a Diable Jambe kick. The floodwater begins draining away as Ginrummy watches the scene in shock, but becomes embarrassed as Sanji ogles her. Some more of her crewmates arrive, and she reveals that Sheepshead has been defeated and says that they should report that the samurai is not here, as he has not shown himself after all they have done. As the enemy pirates leave, Sanji stares at the defeated Sheepshead, who wears a belt bearing an unusual Jolly Roger. Meanwhile, at the Kid Pirates' hideout, a massive person falls onto the ground, causing a massive shockwave throwing the pirates into chaos.
Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, and Basil Hawkins watch in shock as the dust settles, revealing a large hole created by the impact. Hawkins recalls hearing about a legend of a Sky Island where a monster lives, and it is reported to Kid that the impact has caused one of their ships to capsize, which causes him to become angry at the thing that fell. A short time earlier, a very large man came to Ballon Terminal looking for a place to die. Urouge followed him, wondering what he was doing, and when he found out he sat back and prayed as the man jumped. The man had been defeated seven times, captured by his enemies 18 times, and was set to be executed 40 times. However, all the execution weapons failed, and the man lived life as a criminal, sinking nine large prison ships at one point, as no one could kill him, not even himself. In the present, the man pulls himself out of the hole, complaining that his head hurts, and as he stands before Kid, Apoo, Hawkins, and Killer, it is revealed that he is Kaidou of the Four Emperors. The Supernovas sweat nervously as they stand before Kaidou, who shouts to Donquixote Doflamingo to hurry up, as he is ready to start a massive war because he feels the world is too mundane.","Usopp, Trafalgar D.

Episode 740,Fujitora Takes Action - The Complete Siege of the Straw Hats,8-May-16,"Sengoku and Tsuru arrive on Dressrosa three days after the battle and meet up with Fujitora. Mansherry arrives at the Marine encampment, wanting to help heal the injured citizens. The Marines are easily swayed by her and donate blood to create healing flowers.
Meanwhile, the people of Dressrosa prepare to celebrate Riku Doldo III's return to the throne and Rebecca becoming the crown princess. However, Kyros starts a rumor that she is the daughter of a faraway prince who died in a war, in order to prevent her from being associated with him and his checkered past.
Tsuru rolls a six on Fujitora's die, allowing the Marines to go after the Straw Hats and their allies. Luffy wakes up and Bartolomeo enters Kyros' house to reveal that the Marines are coming for them. The pirates prepare to escape the island.","Three days after Doflamingo's downfall, Vice Admiral Tsuru and General Inspector Sengoku arrive on Dressrosa with Marine reinforcements. Tsuru asks if Luffy is still in the country, which the Marines affirm, but they reveal that they have placed lookouts everywhere and have defenses all across the country. Sengoku remarks that Tsuru is fired up, making her annoyed as she heads to the Marine camp. They reach the camp, where Fujitora is sitting and eating. Tsuru asks him why he is not going after the pirates, but Fujitora reveals that Luffy has had providence on his side; for the past two days he rolled a die with the condition that they would go after him if the die landed on anything other than one, but both times the die has landed on one. He thanks Tsuru for assisting in transporting Doflamingo, but reminds her that he is in charge, and she accepts his decision but says they cannot leave the pirates at large forever. Mansherry then arrives at the camp and asks the Marines to become donors, and they gawk at her cute appearance. Sengoku too remarks that she is cute, but is prodded by Maujii, who berates him for not treating the princess with respect. Mansherry says that the dwarves should not show themselves to anyone outside the royal family but still wanted to heal the citizens, which piques Sengoku's interest.
At the royal palace, Viola walks around wondering where Rebecca is as she remembers Rebecca confronting Riku Doldo III earlier. Rebecca asked Doldo why Kyros would tell a lie like that, but Doldo replied that that was what he wanted. In the downtown area below, Gatz gets the citizens excited by announcing that today will mark Doldo's return to the throne and Rebecca becoming the crown princess. Up in the palace, Elizabello II remarks to Doldo that everyone wanted him back after getting fooled by Doflamingo, being prepared to stake their future on his pacifist ideals. As Doldo remembers looking over Dressrosa while inside the Birdcage, he wishes he could be a god-like king who could fend off natural disasters, though tells an appalled Elizabello that he is only jesting. He says that they will continue their efforts until the day Rebecca inherits the throne, but Elizabello wonders if that will turn out all right, remembering how stubborn Scarlett was when she was young.
Inside, Rebecca is fitted into a yellow dress by attendants, but is left speechless by her reflection. The attendants recall hearing about her father, revealing that they heard that he was a prince of a faraway land and that Scarlett ran away with him, forcing her to be pronounced dead. Upon hearing this, Rebecca's expression sours and she clenches her dress as Viola looks on. Downtown, people discuss the story of Rebecca's father and how he died in a war, leaving her as a true, pure-blooded heir to the throne. Kin'emon and Kanjuro overhear this as they ride on Kanjuro's sparrow carrying groceries, and are confused as they know Kyros to be Rebecca's father. As he sits by Scarlett's grave, Kyros remembers spending time with Rebecca when he was a toy and how he would drop a flower petal into her house every night to tell her he was still there.
Meanwhile, citizens are lining up at the Marine camp to receive glowing flowers that heal their wounds. Kin'emon and Kanjuro notice this as well as the increased Marine presence as they fly higher to avoid drawing attention. At the Marine camp, Mansherry uses the Marines' blood to create the flowers, and Sengoku heartily offers to give many donations, creating a competition between him and the Marines to see who can give the most. As this happens, Fujitora tells Tsuru that she can roll the die, and as always, they will go after the Straw Hats if anything other than a one is rolled. Kin'emon and Kanjuro bring the groceries to Kyros' house, causing Luffy to wake up and scarf down the food. Kin'emon and Kanjuro tell the others about the rumors about Rebecca's father, and Luffy is surprised by this as he sleepily eats the food, though is also in a rush to get back to Sanji's group, causing Zoro to tell him to take it easy. Luffy is angered by the story, but Kyros reveals that he was the one who made it up. He says that he did it because he used to be a criminal and was never meant to interact with the royal family like he did, so he wants Rebecca to live happily without the shadow of his past behind her. Luffy, however, does not buy the explanation.
Right then, Bartolomeo races up to Kyros' house as Kyros receives a call from Leo, and Bartolomeo becomes entranced when he sees five of the Straw Hats together. He reveals to them that Sengoku and Tsuru are on Dressrosa, and at the Marine encampment, Tsuru rolls a six with Fujitora's die. Fujitora is now set on capturing the Straw Hats and the criminals residing in the palace. The Marines are mobilized, though they wonder about breaking the king's asylum, but Fujitora says that he will take all responsibility. The pirates in Kyros' house then prepare to escape the island.","Tsuru, Hototogisu, Sengoku, Issho, Mansherry, Bomba, Maujii, Rampo, Viola, Rebecca, Riku Doldo III, Gatz, Shin Detamaruka, Shin Jaiya, Tegata Ringana, Elizabello II, Cavendish (flashback), Scarlet (flashback), Kanjuro, Kin'emon, Kyros, Monkey D.

Episode 741,A State of Emergency - Rebecca Is Kidnapped!,15-May-16,"The Marines swarm Kyros' house, and the Straw Hats, Law, Bartolomeo, and Bellamy escape from it. However, Luffy departs from the group, saying he needed to do something. Marines occupy the entirety of Dressrosa, but the Corrida Colosseum gladiators take them out in order to clear the way for the Straw Hats.
After fighting through hordes of Marines, Luffy reaches the Royal Palace and speaks to Rebecca through the window, asking her if she is fine with Kyros' decision to exit her life. Rebecca confesses that she is not, and Luffy breaks her out of the palace, outraging both the Marines and the citizens of Dressrosa.","The Marines swarm the streets as they prepare to arrest the Straw Hat Pirates and Law. At the Marine camp, Bastille states that they have occupied the entire island but warns his men to watch themselves anyway. Fujitora then heads out of the camp, leaving the rest of the planning to Bastille. At Kyros' house, Kyros warns the pirates inside that the Marines are coming for them. Usopp is horrified at the news, but everyone else in the house was expecting this and was ready to leave as soon as Luffy woke up. Kyros asks Leo over the Den Den Mushi if he did everything he asked, and Leo affirms this as he watches the Marines run with some other dwarves. The citizens of Dressrosa watch the Marines as well, and a girl is afraid they are after Luffy, but is reassured otherwise. Leo notices the Marines are also headed to the Royal Palace to go after the criminals there, but Bartolomeo reveals that they had been watching the Marines and assures that everything will be all right. He tells the people inside the house to follow him outside, where they would escape through the eastern port. Usopp states that there are Marines there as well, but Bartolomeo reveals that their Corrida Colosseum gladiator allies are stationed throughout the city, ready to clear the way. The Straw Hats point out that they do not have a ship, but the gladiators have one ready for them.
The pirates stand up, preparing to leave the island. Luffy asks Bellamy if he can get up, and the pirate confirms this and does so. Bellamy asks Law why he was saved, and Law replies that Luffy said he was a friend, but the two get into an argument. The Marines begin swarming the house as the pirates rush out of it, and the Marines open fire on them. Bartolomeo blocks their bullets with a barrier, but Luffy suddenly stops and faces the other way. He reveals that he has something to do and tells the others to go on their way. The pirates are surprised but do what he says, although Zoro inadvertently goes in the wrong direction. Luffy leaps into the city below, and the Marines open fire on him, but Luffy activates Gomu Gomu no Fusen to block their bullets before landing and attacking them with rapid punches.
At the Royal Palace, Riku Doldo III calls Tank Lepanto to him, revealing that it is time to announce his return to the throne. Doldo asks his servant to get Rebecca and Viola, and an overjoyed Tank complies. Inside, Viola uses clairvoyance to watch the pirates escaping, and Rebecca is saddened that she could not see Luffy again to thank him. Meanwhile, Fujitora, Tsuru, and Tsuru's soldiers march through the city, with Fujitora planning to use his full power to see if Luffy's luck had run out. At the camp, Bastille asserts his command and gives out orders to continue the assault on the Straw Hats and the Royal Palace. The Straw Hats and their allies run through the city, and Usopp trips over rubble, but Bartolomeo is still awed by him doing that. Usopp wonders if doing this is safe, but Bartolomeo keeps pressing on.
Bastille receives a report that the Straw Hats are heading to the eastern port, so he contacts his men there. However, an unfamiliar person on the other end reports that everything is fine the Marines at the eastern port are blown away. Bastille grows suspicious about the person on the other side, who turns out to be Abdullah and Jeet, and they claim that they need no backup. Bastille exposes them by asking for their name and Marine code, and orders his men at the camp to send reinforcements to the seized eastern port. Meanwhile, Cavendish and Sai take out the Marines headed for the Straw Hats, and Hajrudin lifts up a fallen building blocking their way before throwing it at the Marines. Blue Gilly, Suleiman, and Baby 5 also attack the Marines, and they report to Bastille that the criminals at the palace are now here.
Bastille asks if there is no one left at the palace, when suddenly Luffy comes flying over him as he heads toward a rock spire that he wrapped his arm around. The Marines fire at him as Luffy gets his arm stuck around the spire, but he manages to free himself as he flies into the Flower Field, where he is surrounded by Marines. The Marines in the Flower Field report that they have found Luffy, but Luffy takes them out by raining attacks from above. Luffy shouts Rebecca's name as he finishes off the Marines with a Gear 3 punch, and the impact is noticed by the people in Rebecca's fitting room. Rebecca then hears Luffy calling her name and calls out to him from her window, and Luffy pulls himself up to right outside the window. Rebecca heads toward Luffy despite a guard attempting to block her, and Viola is surprised to see Luffy. Luffy asks Rebecca if she is all right with what Kyros did, knowing that she will never see him again. Rebecca acknowledges that her father is trying to distance herself from her, wondering if it was because she said horrible things to him as she remembers arguing with Kyros back when he was a toy that he would never be able to defeat Doflamingo since he was only a one-legged toy soldier. She asks Luffy if she is annoying to Kyros, but Luffy shouts in exasperation that he only wants to know if Rebecca is fine with what Kyros did. Rebecca emotionally replies that she is not, and Luffy tells her to come with him. Viola and the guards are bewildered by this, and Viola attempts to step in, but Rebecca turns to her and asks her for a favor.
Luffy breaks Rebecca out of the palace, and a man runs to Doldo to reveal what just happened. The citizens below are astonished by this turn of events, and start to turn against Luffy by saying they should have never trusted a pirate. Gatz is also astounded, but proclaims that he still likes Luffy. Maynard points to this to prove his position that pirates cannot be trusted and orders his men to go after Luffy and rescue Rebecca. Luffy leaps into the city with Rebecca holding onto him, and the Marine snipers take careful aim at him. However, their rifles fire blanks, and they suddenly collapse. Bastille hears about this and wonders if this is from Supreme King Haki, but it is revealed the Marines are still conscious. Bastille grows tense knowing that the criminals are nearing escape, and orders all his forces to head to the east. The Straw Hats are nearing the port, and Law notices Sengoku and the gorilla Uhho sitting nearby, with Sengoku reassuring a fallen Marine that the rescue team would soon come. Sengoku then sees Luffy and Rebecca running through the city, and angered citizens join the Marines in pursuing Luffy as he leaps from building to building.","Bastille, Issho, Kyros, Usopp, Nico Robin, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Inhel, Leo, Bartolomeo, Roronoa Zoro, Trafalgar D.

Meanwhile, Fujitora approaches the Straw Hats and the Colosseum gladiators as they wait for Luffy to return. Law goes to talk to Sengoku about Donquixote Rosinante, with Sengoku talking about how he raised Rosinante as a son and Law revealing that he was the boy Rosinante died for.","Luffy continues running across rooftops with Rebecca on his back as the citizens of Dressrosa angrily pursue him, saying they should never have trusted him. Some citizens climb up to the roof Luffy is on, but he leaps over them onto another building and continues running. Luffy leaps back down to the streets as the citizens continue pursuing him, when he suddenly runs into a platoon of Marines. The Marines shoot nets at him, and Luffy attempts to dodge them, but one soldier manages to hit him in midair. Luffy is unable to make it onto a roof and collapses on the ground due to the net being made of Seastone, and a frantic Rebecca frees him. However, they are surrounded by the Marines, who order Luffy to surrender Rebecca, but the pirate refuses as he attacks them. The Marines shoot more nets at him, but Luffy pulls himself and Rebecca away, causing the Marines to become entangled in them. Luffy and Rebecca are sent flying high into the air, causing Rebecca to scream in fright, but Luffy manages to grab onto another building as they descend. They are sent flying into a window, and Luffy runs inside the building, stealing a piece of meat before jumping out the other side. As he runs down the street again, Luffy tells Rebecca that he will leave her behind the hill and lure their pursuers away, as the citizens will take her back to the palace if she is caught. He tells her to head to the small house in the Flower Field, causing Rebecca to remember living there as a child. Luffy tells Rebecca to hurry before Kyros leaves, and she thanks him for everything.
Meanwhile, Kyros packs his belongings inside his house, and holds up a pair of brown gloves, remembering how he held a young Rebecca with them after initially refusing to touch her with his bare hands. He then speaks to Scarlett in his mind, saying that he had fulfilled his role, and asks for her forgiveness for lying about who her husband was, claiming that he did it so Rebecca could live a happy life. Meanwhile, Rebecca reaches the Flower Field, and remembers when she and her parents were picking flowers. She joyfully gave flowers to them before they sold all of them in the city, which she was ecstatic about when they got home. In the present, Rebecca races through the forest leading to the field, but trips over a tree root. She then remembers Kyros going to the burning palace ten years ago when the Donquixote Pirates were taking over, and how they shared one last embrace as a family. Days later, Rebecca was approached by Kyros, who was now turned into the Thunder Soldier toy, carrying the dead Scarlett in his arms. Thunder Soldier apologized to Rebecca for failing to protect her mother, and Rebecca grieved over her as Thunder Soldier promised to protect her. However, Rebecca got angry at Thunder Soldier for not protecting Scarlett, as she had forgotten who he really was. Rebecca remembers spending the remainder of her life happily living with Thunder Soldier, and in the present she silently begs him not to go, as there was so much she had not said to him. Rebecca then gets up and keeps running.
Kyros heads to the door, remembering how he protected Rebecca when he was Thunder Soldier, and how she once told him that she wanted to live with him one day. Rebecca continues running and stumbling through the forest, gaining bruises and cuts on her face and tearing her dress. As she trips again, Rebecca remembers how Thunder Soldier taught to fight, and she determinedly presses on. Kyros prepares to leave, knowing that Rebecca was ridiculed the past ten years for being a member of the deposed royal family, and wanting her to finally live happily as part of the royal family. He has also decided that he should not stay here either. As Kyros opens the door, he is suddenly face to face with Rebecca, who tells him not to lie. Realizing she is talking about his letter, Kyros states that everything he wrote there was true, as he was really once a mass murderer. However, Rebecca states that she does not care about that and that she only has one father and states that's him. The two begin crying as Rebecca embraces her father, telling him to stay by her side like he promised her as a toy, and Kyros slowly embraces her back. He asks if she really is okay with him being her father, which Rebecca happily affirms, and the two emotionally reconcile. At the Royal Palace, Viola approaches Riku Doldo III, revealing that Rebecca had asked her to become crown princess in her stead, much like Scarlett had done years ago.
The Straw Hats, samurai, and the Colosseum gladiators have reached the eastern port, but are forced to wait for Luffy and the suddenly missing Law to return. Suddenly, Fujitora comes flying toward them on a piece of rubble, and Zoro eagerly anticipates a clash as Luffy hurriedly runs to the harbor. At the Marine camp, Bastille tells his men about his strategy to capture the pirates and criminals in one fell swoop by surrounding them and sending in Fujitora to make the final move. Zoro sends a flying slash at Fujitora, but the Admiral leaps off the piece of rubble he is sitting on, which is destroyed by the slash. Zoro prepares to draw more swords, but Bartolomeo blocks him, telling him to leave it to him and the gladiators. At the Marine camp, Bastille receives reports that Marine troops all across the island have lost their weapons and their battleships have been stitched together. Unbeknownst to them, their weapons were stolen by the dwarves, and Leo had sewn their ships together. Bastille gets angry at the reports, and Mansherry wonders if it is all right for her to keep getting Kenpopo donations, but Maujii assures her so, revealing that Kyros had authorized this. A Marine tells his comrade currently giving a donation that they have to go, but Mansherry says they will be done soon, and the entranced Marine eagerly gives her all the time she needs. The Marines report to Bastille that what happened to them is supposedly the work of fairies, which angers the Vice Admiral. At the eastern harbor, Bartolomeo puts up a barrier to block Fujitora, who unsheathes his sword. Luffy sees an explosion in front of him, and wonders if his allies are fighting.
Meanwhile, Sengoku offers Law okaki, which he refuses in favor of having the General Inspector start talking. Sengoku tells Law about what happened thirteen years ago, when he was talking to Donquixote Rosinante about a boy with Amber Lead disease. He warned Rosinante to not let this get in the way of his mission to spy on Doflamingo, which Rosinante agreed to. Sengoku tells Law in the present that Rosinante was special to him, as he met him when he was a kid and his sense of justice was very strong. However, Rosinante did lie to him once. Thirteen years ago, Sengoku was appalled to hear that Doflamingo had heard about their upcoming exchange of the Ope Ope no Mi, and he and Rosinante discussed the plan to bring down the Donquixote Pirates during the exchange. Later, he received a report that Rosinante had died on Minion Island, causing him to weep bitterly. In the present, Sengoku tells Law that four things were lost that day: the Barrels Pirates, Rosinante, the Ope Ope no Mi, and the boy with the Amber Lead disease. Law then reveals to Sengoku that the boy from Flevance that Rosinante cared for was him.","Monkey D.

Episode 743,"Men's Pride - Luffy vs. Fujitora, Head-to-Head",29-May-16,"Law finishes talking with Sengoku, who refuses to discuss the D. in the former's name and says that the best way to honor Donquixote Rosinante's memory is to keep living.
At the eastern port, Fujitora lifts all the rubble on Dressrosa high into the air, intending to drop it on the pirates and gladiators. Suddenly, Luffy arrives and attacks Fujitora, not intending to run away from admirals anymore. As they battle, however, Luffy calls out what his next attack will be before performing it. Eventually, Fujitora overpowers Luffy and sends him crashing into Dressrosa's coastline.","In response to Law's revelation that he is the boy Donquixote Rosinante cared for, Sengoku states that he had already guessed, but asks Law why Rosinante worked so much to help him. Law tells Sengoku how Rosinante took him to hospitals before getting him the Ope Ope no Mi, and he had spent the thirteen years after Rosinante's death working to kill Donquixote Doflamingo. However, Law wonders if that was how he should have lived as a D., and Sengoku is shocked that Law carries the initial in his name. Law asks him if, as the former Fleet Admiral, he knows what it means, but Sengoku replies that he does not know, saying that Rosinante also had no idea and telling Law to not go looking for reasons for Rosinante's love for him. As Law remembers his experiences with Rosinante, Sengoku says that he will not arrest him to talk more and tells him that the best way to honor Rosinante's memory is to remember him and keep on living.
At the eastern port, Fujitora approaches the pirates and gladiators huddled behind Bartolomeo's barrier. Fujitora notices the barrier and unsheathes his sword, causing the loose rubble all across Dressrosa to tremble. The citizens are bewildered as it starts rising into the air, and Gatz notes while broadcasting that this can only be the work of Fujitora. Fujitora lifts all the rubble into the air, forming a giant mass blocking out the sun. The pirates and gladiators stare at it in shock, as well as Riku Doldo III, Viola, Rebecca, and Kyros, who fear for the Straw Hats' survival. Tsuru calls Bastille from the coast, but he is late to respond due to staring at the rubble. She asks him if he requires any more reinforcements in the eastern port, which he denies. Bastille then tells his troops to evacuate the eastern port and help get the citizens there away to safety, saying to not get in Fujitora's way. Law reunites with the pirates and gladiators, telling them that they should run to the ships quickly, but they note that Fujitora will likely crush them regardless. Bartolomeo then notices Luffy running towards them from behind Fujitora, and he tells Luffy to avoid the admiral. However, Luffy sees Fujitora and remembers confronting him before, and with this in mind he calls out to him. Fujitora turns to face Luffy, who proclaims that he is going to punch the admiral, and he does so with Elephant Gun.
A fearful Bartolomeo asks Luffy why he attacked Fujitora, and Luffy replies that in order to become the Pirate King he must be able to beat anyone, including admirals and Four Emperors. Luffy is determined to not run away from them again, remembering how he and his crew were defeated by Bartholomew Kuma on Sabaody Archipelago. Zoro and Usopp understand what he means as Luffy activates Gear 2 and goes after Fujitora again. However, Luffy announces what attack he will make before performing it, puzzling Zoro. Luffy and Fujitora exchange quick blows before Fujitora uses his Devil Fruit powers to force Luffy into the ground. Luffy manages to headbutt his way out of Fujitora's gravity zone as he resumes attacking, though he accidentally says he will kick Fujitora as he throws a punch. Luffy apologizes, but Fujitora replies that the attack did not even graze him as he tries to trap Luffy in more gravity fields, forcing the pirate to run away. Luffy and Fujitora then rapidly exchange blows again before Fujitora hits Luffy with a gravity attack, sending him tumbling into the air. Luffy wonders why his body is growing lighter and heavier as Fujitora forces him into the ground again, but he manages to escape, reactivating Gear 2 and restating that he will not give up despite his allies' pleas.
Fujitora states that Luffy possesses enough power to make that statement, but wonders why Luffy is announcing his attacks, questioning angrily if it were to give him a handicap as he blocks a Gear 3 punch. Luffy replies that it is because he likes Fujitora, which causes the admiral to laugh, and his laughing angers Luffy as they exchange blows again. Fujitora questions the point as he blocks another Gear 3 punch, saying that people should fight in a way that fits their position, without pity, as he uses gravity to send Luffy into the ground. Luffy replies that he does not care, and Fujitora says that he is doing so even though he does not want to as he prepares his next attack. He then attacks Luffy with a wave of gravity, causing the pirate's vision to warp as he is sent flying into Dressrosa's coastline, destroying a large chunk of it.","Trafalgar D.

Episode 744,No Way Out - Admiral Fujitora's Ruthless Pursuit!,5-Jun-16,"The Straw Hats, samurai, and Corrida Colosseum gladiators escape from Admiral Fujitora and run to their ships. Fujitora prepares to crush them with his floating rubble, but the citizens of Dressrosa chase after the criminals with the apparent intention of taking down the Straw Hats themselves due to Luffy kidnapping Rebecca. However, they really knew where Rebecca is and are doing this as a ruse to prevent Fujitora from dropping the rubble and help the Straw Hats escape.
On Orlumbus' flagship, the Yonta Maria, Cavendish, Bartolomeo, Sai, Ideo, Leo, Hajrudin, and Orlumbus ask Luffy for them and their crews to serve under him.","Luffy is sent flying through Dressrosa's coastline by Admiral Fujitora's gravity wave, and upon Cavendish's orders he is grabbed by Hajrudin. Cavendish orders Hajrudin to take Luffy to the port, and Luffy unsuccessfully tries to escape from the giant's grasp and get back to his battle. Zoro prepares to have his turn fighting Fujitora, but Bartolomeo stops him, saying they have another arrangement. The Straw Hats, samurai, and Corrida Colosseum gladiators rush onto the coast, and Usopp wonders how they could have docked all their ships there. Orlumbus reveals to him that his Nita Maria ships are all lined up single file, holding up a makeshift dock leading to the rest of their ships in a foggy area five kilometers away. As the criminals run onto the makeshift dock, Luffy attempts to escape from Hajrudin's grasp yet again, but the giant retains his grip, saying they have something to do.
Fujitora stands by the eastern harbor, intent on not allowing the criminals to escape. He moves the large mass of rubble floating in the sky over the Nita Maria, shocking the people below. The people on Dressrosa are scared as well, and Fujitora begins reflecting, knowing that the Straw Hats and their allies will soon perish. However, even if they somehow managed to escape, they would be targeted by the Four Emperors, so either way they will undergo hell. Fujitora notes Luffy's sympathy for his blindness, but reveals that he blinded himself because he had seen many things he did not want to. Usopp frets about the looming rubble as the criminals run faster, and Fujitora scatters the rubble so that it extends over the entire line of ships. Fujitora begins dropping the rubble when he is suddenly approached by a horde of citizens.
Fujitora attempts to stop them, but they run past him, shouting their intentions to get Rebecca back and take down the criminals themselves. The citizens run to the coast as the criminals notice that the rubble is not coming down, and Luffy stands on Hajrudin's shoulder after convincing him he will not go back. Luffy sees the citizens going after him and wonders what they are doing. As the citizens run past Fujitora, he hears one of them ask why they are doing this, as Rebecca was really with Kyros. Another citizen replies that they knew this, as well as who the fairies really were. As such, the citizens are only putting on a facade, shouting threats with smiles on their faces and stopping at the edge of the coast to cheer on the Straw Hats. Fujitora reflects that everyone really does want to help Luffy and begins wondering what Luffy looks like, as he regrets blinding himself. At the Marine camp, Bastille hears about the citizens at the port and wonders what Fujitora is doing.
The Straw Hats are awestruck when they reach the enormous flagship Yonta Maria, and Bartolomeo promises to show them his ship later. Hajrudin reveals that he and four other giants are going to reform the Giant Warrior Pirates, and Orlumbus says that his fleet of 56 ships should also help them, which confused the Straw Hats. Leo says that he and the Tonta Corps were given permission to help as well, Ideo reveals that he has formed an alliance with Blue Gilly, Abdullah, and Jeet, and Suleiman reveals that he has joined Cavendish. Luffy gets confused at the sudden onslaught of news, and they reveal that they had planned this while staying at the palace for two days.

Episode 745,Sons' Cups - Straw Hat Fleet is Formed!,12-Jun-16,"Luffy initially refuses his allies' request to serve under him, saying he wanted to live freely. However, Cavendish, Bartolomeo, Sai, Ideo, Leo, Hajrudin, and Orlumbus pledge their allegiance to him anyway, forming a one-sided alliance where they will help him whenever he needs.
They come under attack by a pirate alliance, but Fujitora destroys the alliance by dropping his rubble on their ships. The newly formed Straw Hat Grand Fleet celebrates their formation as it is hinted that they will play a role in a pivotal event in the future.","Somewhere at sea, a group of pirates form an alliance to take revenge on Luffy for taking down Doflamingo's market, which they had relied on. They also plan to ransack Dressrosa if Riku has become king again.
On the Yonta Maria, Bartolomeo prepares to complete the agreement for him, Cavendish, Sai, Ideo, Leo, Hajrudin, Orlumbus, and each of their crews to serve under the Straw Hat Pirates. He pours cups of sake for himself and the six captains before emptying the rest of the sake into a very large cup for the Straw Hats. Bartolomeo then restates their request to serve under Luffy, whom they will officially bond with by drinking the sake, but he refuses to drink, saying he does not like the taste. The seven captains are shocked, saying that this is not about the taste, but Luffy continues to refuse, knowing that he would have full control over thousands of people. Bartolomeo tells him that this is a good thing, as they can help Luffy defeat powerful enemies in the New World. Some of the captains get annoyed at the refusal, with Sai and Ideo suggesting that they should force him to drink. Finally, Luffy tells them that he does not want control over them because it would not let him sail freely and become Pirate King like he wanted to. Luffy tells the captains that they already had a bond after they worked together to defeat Doflamingo, and he would come help any of them if they came calling.
Suddenly, the enemy pirate alliance arrives and starts firing at the seven crews' fleet. Orlumbus has Columbus deal with the enemies as the captains resume their discussion. Suddenly, Fujitora's rubble begins dropping on the attacking ships, which are quickly annihilated when Pica's stone legs fall on them, and Fujitora tells Luffy that this is his parting gift to him. On the Yonta Maria, the captains grow emotional over their admiration for Luffy's desire to be free, and they decide to drink their sake cups and pledge allegiance to Luffy regardless of his wishes, as Zoro drinks all the sake in Luffy's cup. The seven crews then bring out food for a banquet to celebrate the formation of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Luffy is angered about this and that he cannot reciprocate the action, but the captains tell him that this is a one-sided alliance where they will come and help him whenever he wishes.
The crews then take part in the party, with Leo telling Cavendish that he will head back later on the Yellow Kabu while Orlumbus orders his fleet to set sail. On Dressrosa, Bastille receives a report that the rubble is falling but none of it is hitting the pirates, shocking him. Fujitora thanks Luffy for cleaning up the World Government's messes, but is shocked when Sengoku overhears it from behind. On the Flower Field, Rebecca and Kyros watch the Straw Hats depart as they hold each other's bare hands for the first time in ten years.

Out at sea, an imprisoned Donquixote Doflamingo wonders who will gain power over the entire world. Meanwhile, the pirate Jack prepares to attack the Marine convoy transporting Doflamingo.
Elsewhere, the Straw Hats are shocked to see Bartolomeo's ship, the Going Luffy-senpai. Bartolomeo shows them their updated bounties and wanted posters, although notably Sanji is wanted only alive.","On the Yonta Maria, the Straw Hat Grand Fleet's party continues. Law stands abovedeck looking at the sea, and Robin approaches him and asks what he will do next. However, Law leaves and tells her to leave him alone.
On Dressrosa, CP0 agents Rob Lucci and Spandam receive a report from Kaku that the Underworld weapons left on Dressrosa were all stolen, most likely by the Revolutionary Army. Lucci then orders that they leave. Meanwhile, the citizens begin celebrating a new beginning for the island as Viola and Gatz dance for them. Riku Doldo III and Viola then reveal the existence of the dwarf king Gancho and princess Mansherry, and the citizens are ecstatic to see them. The humans and dwarves begin fully coexisting and mingling, and Leo has the humans build statues of Luffy, Kyros, and Usopp. Doldo turns his attention to the upcoming Levely, and he and Viola prepare to meet up with Kyros and Rebecca to eat.
Out at sea, a four-battleship Marine convoy sails through a thunderstorm, and Fujitora tells Sengoku while they eat noodles that he will go on a journey due to his failure to capture Luffy and Law. Sengoku tells him to just apologize to Sakazuki, who would swallow his pride, but Fujitora replies that he had pride of his own that he could not swallow. Belowdeck, a chained and imprisoned Donquixote Doflamingo tells Tsuru that Fujitora should have just cooperated with him and everything would have remained orderly. However, Tsuru tells him to accept his defeat, but asks about what might arise from it. Doflamingo says that 25 years after Gol D. Roger has died, a power vacuum has been created as several groups will fight to take the throne and reign over the world. Doflamingo wonders who will emerge victorious, and as he begins shaking his chains, he wonders when the Family of ""D."" will fully show themselves. Some Marines rush over to quell Doflamingo's activity, but Tsuru stops them as Doflamingo tells her to tell the World Nobles that they will be dragged down. Lightning strikes one of the Marine ships, and as Marines work to put it out, they are watched by a pirate nearby. The pirate remarks on the strength of the Marine convoy and tells his captain Jack that it will be impossible to take back Doflamingo. However, Jack is still intent on carrying out the rescue.
Elsewhere, the Straw Hats are shocked as they see Bartolomeo's ship, the Going Luffy-senpai, for the first time. The entire ship pays homage to the Straw Hats, as the masthead is a giant Luffy statue, a wall in the middle is a large replica of the Going Merry's head, there is a giant Chopper figurehead in the stern, and they also have tangerine groves like Nami's. Franky compliments the design, and everyone in the Barto Club is dazzled to hear this. Bartolomeo points to their most important edition, the newly acquired vivre card that Sabo gave to Luffy. Back on the Yonta Maria some time ago, Luffy had given pieces of the vivre card to Bellamy, who decided to go on his own path, as well as all the Grand Fleet crews as they departed. The Straw Hats tell Bartolomeo to set sail for Zou as they worry about their crewmates on the Thousand Sunny, as the last time they had spoken the Sunny team was being chased by the Big Mom Pirates. Zoro then sees in the newspaper that their bounties had gone up, and Bartolomeo beckons them inside his ship to see their new wanted posters, telling Law that his bounty was now 500,000,000. Bartolomeo first points to the autographs that the currently present Straw Hats gave him before showing their updated bounties and wanted posters, which each pirate has mixed reactions to. Usopp's poster now shows his real face and he now has a 200,000,000 bounty, which angers Franky as he only has a 94,000,000 bounty. Sanji's poster also now shows his real face. Bartolomeo reveals that the Straw Hats' allies during the battle on Dressrosa had bounty increases of 50,000,000, and the Straw Hats notice something strange about Sanji's bounty: he is only wanted alive.

Episode 747,The Silver Fortress — Luffy and Barto's Great Adventure,26-Jun-16,"The Straw Hat Pirates and their allies are shocked by the Barto Club's navigational incompetence while sailing through a hail storm in the New World. That night, Luffy and Bartolomeo are captured by Desire and the Sweet Pirates, who take them to the island of Silver Mine.
On Silver Mine, the Silver Pirate Alliance led by Bill prepares to kill Luffy, who is trapped in a silver ball. However, Bartolomeo helps Luffy escape, and the two are chased by the Sweet Pirates, but fall into a chasm along with Desire. Bill hears about this and leaves it to Aveyron, while he makes a donation of silver to a certain man.","The Going Luffy-senpai sails through the New World, and the Barto Club eagerly treats the Straw Hat Pirates to a feast. Suddenly, large chunks of hail start falling, and Bartolomeo tells the Straw Hats to get inside. They refuse, wanting to help, and ask where their navigator is. The Barto Club reveals that they have no navigator, and they just call their granny back home if they need any help. Gambia calls her to ask about the hail, but to the Straw Hats' shock she only gives domestic advice like getting gum off the deck and treating lumps caused by the hail. The Straw Hats begin panicking, and Zoro asks why Bartolomeo is not blocking the hail with his barrier, but Bartolomeo replies that their granny told them not to defy nature. Luffy then jumps onto the masthead and rapidly blows away the hail coming for them, causing the Barto Club to gawk in admiration and Bartolomeo to reflect on how happy he is to be traveling with Luffy.
That night, the pirates sleep on the deck. Luffy gets hungry and gets up, which Bartolomeo notices. He gets up and follows Luffy, wanting to be with him and assist him if possible. Suddenly, a giant piece of meat flies over the ship, and Luffy eagerly grabs onto it, and a shocked Bartolomeo follows him. They are pulled onto a floating platform, and Peseta remarks in awe that Desire, the woman in front of Luffy and Bartolomeo, managed to capture Luffy. The Straw Hats wake up and confront the kidnappers, with Usopp firing a Pop Green. However, Desire and her accomplices destroy it, and Franky attacks with Weapons Left. He knocks one of the kidnappers off her boat, but is otherwise unsuccessful as Desire rescues her accomplice. Peseta and his men then fire cannonballs at the Going Luffy-senpai, but these balls release a sticky substance which traps the Straw Hats and the Barto Club. The kidnappers then escape with Luffy and Bartolomeo in tow.
On Silver Mine, a deserted island near Dressrosa, a group of people bring treasure and a pirate to the giant silver fortress in the center. Inside, Bill sits on a throne, eating pieces of rock and exuding a molten substance as he heads out. Meanwhile, Bartolomeo is forced to mine for ore, with Peseta whipping him if he stops working. Bartolomeo asks him if Luffy is all right, and Peseta affirms this, but says that might not be the case ten minutes from now. Bartolomeo attacks Peseta with his pickax, but Peseta leaves, with Bartolomeo being unable to make a barrier because his hands are stuck to the pickax. Meanwhile, Luffy is in a jail cell, with his entire body below the neck being enveloped in a silver ball, and he futilely attempts to escape somehow. Desire and the Sweet Pirates visit him, revealing that they destroyed the Going Luffy-senpai and that they are the ultimate weapons group thanks to Bill's Gutsu Gutsu no Mi. Luffy shouts that she is lying, which deeply angers Desire, but Luffy stops yelling as he gets weak from hunger. He asks Desire if he can eat the meat that she lured him with, and she refuses, but eventually lets him eat some of her chocolate. She then gets a call, and tells her accomplices that it is time.
Bill walks into an auditorium, with his henchmen all chanting his name excitedly. He greets his crew, the Silver Pirate Alliance, and some of his men present wanted pirates that they had captured. Desire then arrives with Luffy in tow, and the pirates are shocked that they captured the famous pirate. Bill tells his men that they have come together to form a large crew of high strength, and have defeated over a hundred enemy crews in the process. By building up enough strength, they will aim to be the top pirates in the world, even surpassing the Four Emperors. Bill presents the bodies of their enemies, all mummified in metal, and tells Luffy that this is where he will end up as he reaches into his molten chest, revealing that he ate the Gutsu Gutsu no Mi and became a Blast Furnace Human. As some molten lava launches from Bill's body, Bartolomeo suddenly comes flying up through the stage, ready to defend Luffy. He holds back the Silver Pirate Alliance with his pickax, but the pickax is broken by Desire. Bartolomeo fully realizes that it is Desire and asks her what she is doing here, but she replies that it is none of his business. Bill pulls two molten swords out of his chest and attacks Luffy, who rolls away, and Bill's attack cuts into the silver ball and melts part of it. Luffy and Bartolomeo are cornered by the Silver Pirate Alliance, but Luffy is intent on escaping as he rolls through the pirates, and Bartolomeo chases after him.
Luffy bowls over more pirates as he rolls up a ramp, but loses the energy Desire's chocolate bar gave him and rolls back down and back into the stage, rolling into the exit on the opposite side. An angry Bill orders his subordinates to chase Luffy and Bartolomeo, and Desire and her crewmates return to their Battle Boats. Luffy and Bartolomeo rest outside, having lost their pursuers, and Luffy trusts Bartolomeo to guard him while he is in the silver ball, which the pirate is eagerly willing to do. Luffy gets hungry and wishes he had more of Desire's chocolate, and Bartolomeo reveals that he and Desire were once childhood friends. They went out to sea separately, but Bartolomeo wonders why she is an enemy to them now. Suddenly, they are confronted by Desire and her crew, and run away. The Sweet Pirates pursue them on their racers, and Desire offers to have Bill spare her old friend Bartolomeo if he hands over Luffy, but an unwavering Bartolomeo refuses to betray his idol as he starts rolling with the silver ball. An angered Desire fires cannonballs rapidly at Luffy and Bartolomeo, but ends up creating a chasm which the two pirates fall into. However, Desire is unable to stop in time and falls into the chasm as well, and her stopped crewmates look down in shock.
At Bill's throne, Tanaka arrives through the floor, wondering what the outside ruckus is. Peseta presents a large quantity of silver to Tanaka, which he is grateful for. Bill tells Tanaka to greet Gild Tesoro for him, and also to take care of the wanted pirates they had captured. Suddenly, Peseta gets a call, and tells Bill that Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire have fallen into the abyss. Bill tells him to call Aveyron, and inside an underground mine track, Aveyron gets Peseta's call, and turns his hands and feet into wheels as he prepares to depart.","Monkey D.

Episode 748,An Underground Maze - Luffy vs. the Rail Car Human,3-Jul-16,"Inside the underground mines, Luffy and Bartolomeo are attacked by the Rail Car Man Aveyron. Desire is attacked as well, which shocks her, as Bill had rescued her crew after it was destroyed. The three are then sent plummeting further underground, where they discover members of the Silver Pirate Alliance who are enslaved as miners due to not pleasing Bill. Bartolomeo manages to free his hands, and Aveyron returns, unwittingly freeing Luffy from his silver ball with an attack. Luffy and Bartolomeo then work together to defeat Aveyron, and upon hearing about this, Bill orders the underground mine to be buried.","In an underground tunnel in Silver Mine, Bartolomeo frees himself from a pile of ore he was buried in after falling. He looks for Luffy, and thinks that he has fallen into a nearby chasm due to his straw hat being on the edge of it, but to his relief Luffy calls out from another pile of ore, which Bartolomeo frees him from. Desire then gets up from her fall, and sees her Battle Boat in ruins. As Bartolomeo gives Luffy his straw hat back, Desire petitions Bartolomeo to let her have Luffy, and Bartolomeo refuses, asking her why she is enemies with them. Luffy looks up and wonders why there are a lot of train tracks up above them, and Aveyron wheels down a set of tracks elsewhere. Desire attempts to contact someone, but gets no reception, and admits to Bartolomeo that she has no knowledge of the tracks despite being in the Silver Pirate Alliance. Suddenly, Aveyron alerts the trio that he is coming, and he rolls right toward Luffy.
Aveyron reveals that he ate the Koro Koro no Mi, allowing him to roll on the train tracks, and it is his duty to eliminate anyone who stumbles into the underground mines. Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire manage to get out of Aveyron's way as he speeds right past them, and Desire wonders why he tried to attack her as well. Aveyron turns around and turns his front wheels back into hands, reaching into the lid on his back and pulling out bombs. Bartolomeo and Desire push the encased Luffy along the tracks as they race away from Aveyron, who throws his bombs at them. Bartolomeo and Desire end up running in place on the rolling Luffy as they traverse the twists and jumps of the rail tracks. They eventually come to a fork in the tracks and decide to go right, but Aveyron reveals that they are headed for hell as the pirates roll and fall into a deep chasm. Aveyron reports to Bill where the pirates are headed as he prepares to follow them, and in his throne room, Bill assures Desire's crewmates that his units are searching for her.
Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire get up at the bottom of the chasm, and they hear Aveyron pursuing them. Luffy curses being trapped in a silver ball, and Desire brags that Bill's creations cannot be broken that easily, causing Bartolomeo to question why she is proud of Bill after his subordinate tried to kill her. However, Desire replies that a traitor like him has no right to say that, which confuses him. Desire tells her old friend that when they were younger they had promised to aim for the top together, but she set off alone with her friends after Bartolomeo decided to help Luffy become Pirate King instead. She reveals that her crew met with tragedy as all but four of them were shot down and killed by an enemy ship. As they were floating in the wreckage, they were approached by Bill, who rescued them and accepted them into his alliance, giving Desire his large Battle Boat. Desire says that she was glad to meet someone who shared her ideals and that everyone else in the alliance trusted Bill to. She captured Luffy in order to please Bill, and also because she knew about Bartolomeo's dedication to him. Bartolomeo still refuses to trust Bill and as Desire argues with him, the trio are suddenly approached by four miners.
The miners take them to a house in a mining colony, where Bartolomeo tries to get rid of the sticky substance binding his hands by dipping them in hot water. The miners find out that the pirates were also dropped into their location, but fail to break the silver ball Luffy is encased in. Luffy wonders what this place is, and the miners reveal that they were enslaved and forced to work in the underground mines by Bill after they failed to bring him treasure and wanted pirates. An appalled Desire runs out, struggling to reconcile her vision of Bill with the one the miners presented. Luffy asks if there is any way to escape, but the miners reveal that Aveyron always thwarts any of their attempts. Aveyron suddenly calls out as he gets closer to the mining colony, and Bartolomeo hurriedly tries to free his hands. As Aveyron reaches the bottom, Desire confronts him and asks if Bill really ordered him to kill her, which he affirms, causing Desire to rush and attack him. Aveyron throws many bombs at her, but she deflects all of them, and Bartolomeo frees his hands as the miners cheer for Desire.
Suddenly, Aveyron throws a bomb at Luffy, Bartolomeo, and the miners, throwing them to the ground. He then races toward Luffy and pulls out a drill Bill specially made for him, in order to impale Luffy with it. He plunges the spinning drill into Luffy's ball, but the attack is too low and only destroys the ball, freeing Luffy. As Luffy confronts Aveyron, the Rail Car Man pulls out his most powerful weapons and rushes at his opponent with a giant silver hammer, but Luffy shatters it. Aveyron then shoots cannonballs upward at Luffy, but he sends them flying back down with Jet Gatling, injuring Aveyron. Aveyron then escapes into the mine tunnels, and Luffy and Bartolomeo pursue him. He manages to keep an advantage by quickly changing direction, leaving bombs behind each time, but Luffy and Bartolomeo continue the chase. After Aveyron dodges a Jet Gatling attack, Bartolomeo tells Luffy to leave this to him, and he puts a barrier over the track that leads into a loop going back to them. Aveyron is sent flying toward Luffy by the loop, and Luffy finishes him off with Jet Bazooka, causing Aveyron to fly backward and set off the bombs he left behind, which cause him to fly back until he returns to the mining colony, dazed and defeated. The miners and Desire are shocked by Aveyron's defeat as Luffy and Bartolomeo return and prepare to leave the mining colony. In Bill's throne room, Bill and Peseta find out about Aveyron's defeat, and Bill decides to bury everyone inside the underground mine.","Bartolomeo, Monkey D.

However, Kin'emon arrives and helps them escape, and Zoro defeats Peseta. As the pirates prepare to return to the besieged Going Luffy-senpai, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are confronted by Bill, who reveals that he was the one who annihilated Desire's crew.","In the underground mining colony on Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire prepare to escape by taking a train track leading above ground. Bartolomeo is excited to follow Luffy, as it makes him feel like a member of the Straw Hat Pirates. Desire turns to the enslaved miners and asks if they want to come with them, but the miners refuse, not wanting to face Bill's wrath. Bartolomeo assures them that Luffy will beat Bill, but they are skeptical of that. However, Desire says that they are only waiting to die down here, so it would be better to take their chances at gaining freedom. The miners decide to accompany them, and they run up the track. However, the group is ambushed by Peseta and his men, who fire cannons at them. The track collapses from the explosions, and Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Fusen to soften his allies' landing. The tracks start falling down on the pirates and miners, but Bartolomeo blocks them with his barrier, and he throws the barrier upward at Peseta to hit him with the pieces of track it collected. Peseta dodges the strike and admires the barrier, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier staircase leading outside.
Peseta and his men once more shoot at the ascending pirates and miners, with Peseta knowing that Bartolomeo can only create a limited area of barrier, which he used on the staircase. The pirates and miners manage to escape the cannon blasts, but Peseta assures one of his men that he has backup plans ready. A platoon of Silver Pirate Alliance members come and block the entrance, firing packs full of Bill's molten ore. However, one of the miners is suddenly replaced by Kin'emon, who cuts through the deluge of ore. The miner Kin'emon replaced is transported to the Going Luffy-senpai, which has docked at Silver Mine. Law had used Shambles to switch the two, and he is left exhausted by the effort. Inside the mine, Luffy knocks out the Silver Pirate Alliance members as he and his allies finally escape the mine. However, Peseta confronts them once again and prevents them from going any further, as he raises up Desire's captured crewmates hung on a piece of track. Peseta uses his hostages to force the pirates and miners to surrender, but the hostages are suddenly cut free by Zoro.
Peseta laughs at Zoro's arrival, remembering how Zoro got caught in his Adhesive Shell the last time they met. An angry Bartolomeo attempts to attack Peseta, but Luffy holds him back because this is Zoro's fight. Peseta fires Adhesive Shells at Zoro, but Zoro cuts through all of them without getting anything stuck on him. Zoro tells a shocked Peseta that it is shameful for a swordsman to get something stuck on him like that, and he uses Three Sword Style to create a whirlwind that sends Peseta and his men flying away, all of them stuck in adhesive. Desire regroups with her crew and tells them to go to the port, but says that she will stay behind a bit longer as she pulls out her blade. The Sweet Pirates go out to sea to wait for her, and the miners depart as well, thanking the trio for freeing them. Luffy and Bartolomeo question if Desire aims to settle things with Bill, which she affirms, and she apologizes to Luffy for her rudeness to him earlier. Zoro and Kin'emon tell Luffy and Bartolomeo that they should get back to the Going Luffy-senpai, and the four of them run off.
Suddenly, a giant wave of molten ore falls onto the wooden bridge, destroying part of it and separating Luffy and Bartolomeo from Zoro and Kin'emon. Bill then appears, and Luffy tells Zoro and Kin'emon to go on without them. Bill laments letting Zoro escape, but he is eager to get his hands on Luffy and his bounty. At sea, the Going Luffy-senpai comes under attack by Battle Boat riders, whom Usopp and Franky successfully repel this time, and Law wonders where Luffy is. On Silver Mine, Desire tells Luffy and Bartolomeo that she will settle things with Bill, but Bill replies that his way of settling things is to smelt everybody on the island. Desire is shocked at this, and Bill states that his true aim is to collect the bounties of the people who allied with him. For that reason, he recruited Desire, a natural leader, by annihilating most of her fleet and rescuing the survivors. Desire becomes enraged at Bill for betraying her, and she prepares to attack him.","Monkey D. Luffy, Bartolomeo, Desire, Peseta, Trafalgar D.

As the Straw Hats and Barto Club set off for Zou, a powerful man known as Gild Tesoro receives the report of Bill's death.","Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire confront Bill, who mocks their dreams of reaching the top of the New World as childish. Bill reveals to Desire that he used everyone in his Silver Pirate Alliance to give him wealth so that he could live the most luxurious life in the world, and questions whether she really intends to defeat him and if she really believes she is stronger than him. Bill taunts Desire, and she starts rushing at him in anger, but Luffy suddenly flies in front of her with Gear 2 activated and punches Bill into a cliff face. Bill gets back up, and Desire attempts to help Luffy, but Bartolomeo tells her to leave the fight to Luffy. Bill expresses his disgust for Luffy as he pulls two swords out of his chest, but Luffy shatters them in their clash. Bill then pulls out an axe, but Luffy dodges its strikes and kicks Bill in the chest before punching him into another cliff face. Bill gets back up, and realized just how strong a person with a 500,000,000 bounty really is. Right then, a Silver Pirate Alliance Battle Boat squadron arrives at the scene, and Bill tricks them into thinking Desire brought the Straw Hats here to betray them while Desire attempts to tell them the truth about Bill.

Bill lands deep underground, and Tanaka suddenly arrives at his location. Tanaka expresses disappointment that Bill was defeated by a mere pirate, and says that the Monster of the New World will discard him for such a failure. Bill remembers how the Monster of the New World brought him and his crew down to their knees with the power of money, and frantically begins eating lots of ore in an attempt to salvage his fate. Tanaka notes the large amount of ore Bill is consuming, but decides to leave things up to him as he departs. Meanwhile, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire run to the shore when they are suddenly passed by several Silver Pirate Alliance members. To their shock, the ground underneath them begins erupting with molten ore. Meanwhile, at the Going Luffy-senpai, the Straw Hats and Barto Club continue fighting off the Silver Pirate Alliance as Zoro and Kin'emon return and help them. The pirates wonder why Luffy and Bartolomeo are taking so long, and they notice that Silver Mine is beginning to melt away.
On Silver Mine, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire are approached by Bill, who is incredibly large and exuding molten ore from his skin. The trio decides to retreat, but Bill shoots out several waves of molten ore at them, which Bartolomeo manages to block with a barrier. However, the trio struggles to dodge the flow of ore, and Desire accidentally falls into a chasm, but Bartolomeo catches her. Desire wonders why he is helping her instead of Luffy, and Bartolomeo replies that he would never forsake a friend, although Desire replies that he did that to her. Bill prepares to attack Luffy with molten ore, but Bartolomeo manages to pull Desire up in time for him to put a barrier in front of Luffy. The two of them prepare to defeat Bill, and Bartolomeo creates a barrier hand to push the molten ore back at Bill. Bill then appears before them coated in silver, and he says that their dreams are not enough to help them survive the New World as he creates a ball of molten ore in the air. As Bill prepares to hurl it at the trio, Luffy rushes at him and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum, breaking through the ball of ore and sending Bill flying into his palace.
Bartolomeo is excited to have seen Luffy fight, but Desire notes that the molten ore Bill created is still there and is eating away at the island.

Right then, Luffy, Bartolomeo, and Desire come riding in on Desire's Battle Boat. Inside Silver Mine, molten ore pours into the fortress as the entire island sinks into the ocean. As dusk falls, the Sweet Pirates board the Going Luffy-senpai, and Desire thanks Luffy and Bartolomeo for taking care of her. Bartolomeo and his crew ask if she and her crewmates want to join the Barto Club, but Desire declines, wanting to pursue their dreams separately and not wanting to serve Luffy. The Sweet Pirates then head out to sea as the Going Luffy-senpai's sails are unfurled and the Straw Hats and Barto Club prepare to head to Zou.
Later in the night, a Revolutionary Army ship draws near to Gran Tesoro. Koala notes that the Monster of the New World resides there, and his power is equal to that of the World Nobles.

Suddenly, Luffy sees the Thousand Sunny docked at one of the elephant's back legs, and the Barto Club is excited to see it. Franky sees that the ship has no major damage, so their crewmates must have escaped from the Big Mom Pirates. Luffy calls out to Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Momonosuke, but gets no answer, and he leaps over onto the empty Sunny.

The Straw Hats encourage it, with Usopp dubbing it ""Ryunosuke"", and it continues climbing despite its progress being lost. As Ryunosuke continues climbing, Luffy wonders how Sanji and their other crewmates got up to Zou, and then asks Kin'emon and Kanjuro why they want to go to Zou in the first place. The samurai reveal that Zou was their original destination after leaving Wano Country, and they wanted to reunite with Momonosuke as well as see if their comrade Raizo the ninja, who was separated from them at sea, had made it here. The male pirates are all awestruck to hear about a ninja, and wonder what kind of abilities he has.
Kanjuro jokes around with Kin'emon in response, and the riders suddenly see a small monkey named Bariete falling down towards them. The Straw Hats and Law dodge the falling monkey, but Kin'emon and Kanjuro are distracted from playing around and are hit, causing them to fall off Ryunosuke. The pirates call out to the samurai, who reveal that they are all right and tell them to go on ahead.

However, after seeing how much Ryunosuke is suffering, they decide to continue on to the top. As the sun goes down, Luffy goes to sleep as Ryunosuke nears the top. Sleeping causes Luffy to lose his grip on Ryunosuke, and Usopp tries to catch him, but only grabs his backpack as Luffy falls down below. As he falls, Luffy wakes up and grabs hold of Ryunosuke's horns, but this causes Ryunosuke's front legs to lose their grip, causing it to bend over backwards. The Straw Hats encourage it to grab hold of the leg again, and after a great effort Ryunosuke manages to do so and continues climbing. As the pirates near the top, Ryunosuke gives a last push upward, and they reach Zou successfully. However, Ryunosuke turns back into a drawing, and the pirates mourn for it except for Zoro and Law, who considered it only a cheap drawing and wanted to focus on the island they are on.
The pirates walk toward a gateway to a place called the Mokomo Dukedom, and Luffy pulls himself to the top of it, allowing him to survey the entire dukedom. Usopp joins Luffy as the others walk through the gateway, whose gates were destroyed.

Meanwhile, a rabbit mink named Carrot spies on them from behind a bush, and is shocked that they managed to get past Bariete. Elsewhere, Luffy runs through an abandoned city, wondering where everyone is and calling out for Sanji's group.

He then enters the Whale Forest, and is awestruck at the giant tree shaped like a whale in the center. Luffy traverses through the trees, but he is unknowingly being watched by a mink named Pedro. Meanwhile, a canine mink named Wanda stops her fellow mink Carrot from attacking the Straw Hats, saying that they need to deal with an intruder in the Whale Forest. Usopp notices that Wanda is wearing Nami's clothes and becomes paranoid; Robin suggests that the minks could be cannibals, which only frightens Usopp more. Meanwhile, Luffy surveys the Whale Forest, but is suddenly confronted by two minks. Carrot then jumps a very high distance in order to survey the Whale Forest, shocking the Straw Hats with her abilities, and sees a disturbance occurring there. She comes back down and climbs on Wanda's steed Wany, and Wanda gives the Straw Hats directions to get to the Rightflank Forest, where they will find the corpse of their crewmate, which appalls them. Wanda and Carrot ride toward the Whale Forest, with Wanda revealing that the pirates they just met are the Straw Hat Pirates, and that Luffy is probably the intruder in the Whale Forest. However, the Guardians may not show him mercy despite who he is.
Meanwhile, Usopp freaks out about the minks and what happened to their crewmates, and Robin only continues assuming the worst about the minks. However, Zoro and Franky are confident that their crewmates are safe, and Robin asks Law if his crewmates are here as well. Law affirms this, though he did not plan a way to get back to them because he thought he would never seen again, but he realizes he has Bepo's Vivre Card in his possession.

In the Whale Forest, Luffy clashes with a bull mink named Roddy; the two butt heads while Roddy discharges electrical energy. Luffy and Roddy fight evenly, with both parties managing to repel the other. The other Guardian, a gorilla mink named Blackback, wonders how Roddy's Electro does not work on Luffy, who reveals to them that he is made of rubber. Luffy and Roddy continue fighting, when suddenly Bepo, Jean Bart, Shachi, and Penguin arrive at the scene. They recognize Luffy and tell Roddy to stop attacking, as Luffy is a friend, but Roddy refuses. Jean Bart tries to break the two up by force, but an angry Blackback flips him over. An enraged Roddy mounts another charge, but Wanda and Carrot then arrive, throwing a fluttering object to distract Roddy and bananas to pacify Blackback. Luffy asks Wanda why they were attacking him, and Wanda reveals that the Guardians are tasked with keeping intruders out of the Whale Forest. Wanda then talks to Pedro, who is standing on a treetop, apologizing for Luffy's intrusion and telling him to call back the Guardians. Pedro does so, and the large number of Guardians that had secretly surrounded Luffy all disperse; Luffy is bewildered due to not knowing they were there, and Wanda tells him to be glad this was not a moonlit night.

Robin, Zoro, and Law inspect various buildings as Usopp continues panicking, and the Straw Hats see large claw marks on the buildings, big footprints on the ground, and torture devices with blood on them. Robin then reveals that whatever happened to cause this damage was only a week or two ago, meaning Sanji and the others were likely involved in it. Meanwhile, Wanda reveals to Luffy that the country was destroyed by Jack as Wanda and Carrot emotionally remember the bloodshed that occurred not too long ago.

Luffy, Wanda, and Carrot reunite with Law and the rest of the Straw Hats and head to the Right Belly Fortress, where they receive an unexpectedly friendly welcome from the minks. They then reunite with Nami and Chopper, but Nami starts crying as she begins to reveal something about Sanji.","As Zou begins shaking due to the upcoming Eruption Rain, the Heart Pirates climb on trees while Luffy joins Wanda and Carrot atop Wany's back. At Kurau City, the concerned Straw Hats wonder why Zou is shaking. Wany starts to run as the elephant carrying Zou on its back, Zunesha, lifts up its trunk and spews out a large volume of water onto Zou. The Straw Hats run away, but realize that it is too late to avoid it. Meanwhile, Wany, Wanda, and Carrot are submerged in the raging flood, and eventually emerge from it; they then realize that Luffy has fallen off. They see Luffy flailing in the torrent, and Carrot leaps through tree branches to rescue him. Carrot barely misses Luffy's hand as he sinks underwater and is approached by a shark. Right as Luffy is by the shark's mouth, however, Carrot grabs him and brings him back onto Wany. Meanwhile, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete climb back up to Zou on a cat Kanjuro drew, which they call Nekozaemon. Suddenly, the water from the Eruption Rain comes flowing down, which Bariete explains the source of. Kanjuro reveals that the water will cause Nekozaemon to melt as they are hit by the cascade.
Meanwhile, Wany swims through the flood, and Wanda explains to Luffy that Zunesha washed itself twice a day by spraying water on its back. The minks took advantage of this by building aqueduct systems to get drinking water, as well as catching fish to eat. Bepo then arrives by swinging through the trees, and tells Luffy to tell Law where he and the Heart Pirates are since he cannot leave the forest. Carrot tells Luffy that although Bepo is a native of this island, he is still a pirate, and so remains under the care of Master Nekomamushi. At Kurau City, the Straw Hats have escaped the flood on the rooftop of a building, although a frightened Usopp has climbed all the way up a tall tower. Usopp expresses his fright at the Eruption Rain (as the shark cruises by, causing him more panic), and as he looks out he spots Luffy riding with Wanda and Carrot. However, Carrot is biting Luffy, and Usopp thinks that they are eating him. Luffy tries to get Carrot off of him, and they pass by some crucifixes in Kurau City. Wanda and Carrot get emotional as they remember Jack torturing a dog mink in order to get information on someone's whereabouts, but the mink refused to tell him. Luffy asks about Jack again, and Wanda reveals that she read his obituary in the newspaper a few days ago. He had attacked four Marine ships transporting Donquixote Doflamingo, and managed to sink two of them, but was ultimately brought down. However, his death could not be confirmed, and Wanda thinks he is still alive, saying that she will never forgive him.
As the floodwaters finally drain away, Wanda decides to take a shortcut as Wany picks up its speed. As Luffy expresses excitement at exploring Zou, Law suddenly teleports himself and the Straw Hats right in front of Wany. Usopp attempts to use Zoro's power to threaten the minks into handing Luffy over, but a slightly annoyed Wanda states that they mean no harm and are already at their destination, the Right Belly Fortress. Wanda tells the two guards at the entrance that the Straw Hat Pirates have arrived, surprising them. Inside the Right Belly Fortress, Nami is sleeping on a large sheep mink named Yomo, and Chopper comes to her to reveal that their crewmates are here. Yomo accidentally causes Nami to fall off him as he gets up, but Nami is excited for a reunion. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Law enter the Right Belly Fortress, and receive an unexpectedly warm welcome from the minks. Zoro confides to Wanda that they had thought minks were hostile to outsiders, but Wanda replies that they considered humans to be hairless versions of themselves and did not judge by appearance, but by character. Nami and Chopper then appear, but are stopped by some affectionate minks.

Episode 756,Start to Counterattack - Great Moves by the Curly Hat Pirates!,11-Sep-16,"Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete end up back at the Thousand Sunny, and decide to resume climbing to Zou tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats reunite with Brook, and Nami reveals to them how they escaped the Big Mom Pirates 11 days ago. They had reached Zou a day later, and Wanda reveals that they helped save Zou. However, the discussion is interrupted when they find out that Duke Inuarashi has woken from his coma, and Wanda reveals that Inuarashi is one of Zou's two rulers along with Nekomamushi.","Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete sit on a deformed Nekozaemon after being deluged by Zou's Eruption Rain; they then notice in shock that they have fallen back to the Thousand Sunny. They are intent on continuing, but realize that Nekozaemon is severely deformed and dripping ink, which frightens them. They push Nekozaemon upward, but the severely weakened cat drawing quickly slides back down after taking a few steps, nearly falling into the ocean. Realizing Nekozaemon is unable to continue, and seeing that the sun has nearly set, the samurai decide to return to the Sunny and resume their climb the next morning.
Meanwhile, the Straw Hats feast with the minks inside the Right Belly Fortress. The minks show affection to all the pirates by rubbing themselves against them, and Zoro is the only one annoyed by this. Carrot reveals to Usopp that the minks only eat hairless animals, and when Usopp asks why the minks have welcomed them like this, Carrot reveals that it is because they are their saviors' friends. Right then, Brook runs into the fortress, wearing very tattered clothes. Brook greets his crewmates, apologizing to Luffy about Sanji. Usopp asks about Momonosuke, and Brook's expression changes as he reveals that Momonosuke does not seem to like the minks and so is hiding in his room. However, Brook thinks this could be for the best, and gathers his crewmates around him. He tells them to avoid mentioning the words ""samurai"" and ""Wano Country"", because doing so could offend and anger many of the people here. However, as Brook reveals the reason behind it, a group of canine minks enter the fortress and drool as they stare in obsession at Brook, calling him ""Baron Corpse"". The Straw Hats then realize that Wanda was referring to Brook when she told them about finding the corpse of their crewmate, and Wanda reveals that it was their nickname for him since canine minks like them loved chewing on bones. As the canine minks bite and gnaw on Brook, Chopper asks Luffy where Law is, and Luffy reveals that he went to reunite with his crewmates in the Whale Forest. Nami then asks what they are going to do about Sanji, but Luffy and Zoro are not particularly concerned about him since he left a note and did not seem to be kidnapped. However, Nami and Chopper are still worried about him because his departure did not seem right. Franky then interrupts, telling Nami and Chopper that he and the others have no idea what has really happened since the Sunny crew left Dressrosa 11 days ago. The others concur, and Nami agrees to tell them what happened, starting with them being chased by the Big Mom Pirates.
11 days ago, the Curly Hat Pirates were shocked to see the Big Mom Pirates' singing ship pursuing them, with Pekoms, Tamago, and Capone Bege commandeering it in an attempt to capture Caesar Clown. Sanji got permission from Luffy to fight back, and he began a counterattack despite Caesar's protests. The singing ship fired cannonballs at them, and Brook froze all of them with Soul Parade. Chopper activated Monster Point and used Caesar as a bag to hold all the cannonballs, hurling him toward the Big Mom Pirates. Sanji then leaped into the air and kicked Caesar with Diable Jambe, sending the flaming cannonballs flying into the singing ship and causing a massive explosion. Caesar fell towards the water, but Sanji grabbed him and returned to the Sunny. As the Big Mom Pirates dealt with the sudden chaos, Nami created a rainstorm to create fog, which allowed the Sunny to escape.
In the present, the Straw Hats applaud the Curly Hats for their maneuvers, and Nami reveals that they reached Zou the next day. Robin notes that the earliest signs of damage in Kurau City were from just over two weeks ago, and Wanda reveals that by 10 days ago, Zou had mostly been destroyed. Wanda is fine with telling the curious Straw Hats what happened, and prepares to do so, but is suddenly interrupted when a sloth mink arrives at the fortress. The mink reveals that Duke Inuarashi has woken from his coma, which causes the minks to celebrate and Wanda to shed tears of joy. Chopper and the minks Miyagi and Tristan run to Inuarashi's location to tend to him, and the sloth mink tells Wanda that Inuarashi has requested an audience with the Straw Hats. Luffy asks who Inuarashi is, and Wanda reveals that he is the ruler of the Mokomo Dukedom. He had fallen into a coma ever since the dukedom was destroyed along with Nekomamushi, his fellow ruler. The two ruled the dukedom together, with Inuarashi being the Ruler of Day and Nekomamushi being the Ruler of Night.","Zunesha, Kanjuro, Bariete, Kin'emon, Franky, Yomo, Nami, Nico Robin, Monkey D.

On the way, she tells them Jack's invasion. 17 days ago, Jack led the Beasts Pirates in a raid on Kurau City in order to find Raizo the ninja. The minks claimed to not know Raizo, but the pirates attacked regardless, causing the minks to fight back.","Law walks through the Whale Forest, and the members of his crew appear in front of him. They have a happy reunion, and go further into the forest to catch up.
Meanwhile, Wanda takes the Straw Hats to see Duke Inuarashi through a passage in the Rightflank Fortress. The Straw Hats gaze in awe at the plants on the ceiling that provide light, and then realize that Luffy is missing. They find Luffy sitting on a tree outside the passageway eating grapes, and continue to be impressed by the beautiful scenery in the Rightflank Fortress. Wanda then reveals that the minks do not usually live in the fortress, but in Kurau City, which used to be intact and full of life. Minks of all shapes and sizes had friendly interactions with each other as they lived normal lives. However, the city was leveled just over two weeks ago, and Wanda prepares to tell the Straw Hats what happened. 17 days ago, the people of Kurau City heard a bell ringing, but soon realized that it was the Raid Bell, which they had rarely heard before. At the gate to the Mokomo Dukedom, Bariete frantically rang the Raid Bell as an unknown force pounded on the gate, and the nearby guards braced themselves for an attack. The invaders finally broke through, causing Bariete to fly into the rampart wall, and he got back up and continued ringing the bell as the invaders, consisting of several armed people and a massive quadrupedal object, raced toward Kurau City.
The invaders entered Kurau City, and the minks retreated as they gathered together in fear. The large object was revealed to be a mammoth, and one of the invaders, Sheepshead, revealed that they were the Beasts Pirates and the mammoth was Jack, one of the three Disasters who are Kaidou's right-hand men. The Beasts Pirates revealed that they were looking for a samurai from Wano Country, Raizo, but the minks claimed that they neither knew Raizo nor his location. Sheepshead berated Ginrummy for calling Raizo a samurai when he was a ninja, but Ginrummy replied that samurai could refer to anyone in Wano Country. Led by Monjii, the minks continued professing that they knew nothing, and offered to let Jack speak with the Duke in peace. However, Jack responded to this by destroying several buildings with his trunk, throwing the minks into chaos, and he refused such an offer as he ordered his soldiers called Pleasures to attack. One of the Pleasures targeted a frightened young mink, but the mink suddenly leaped toward him and struck him with an Electro attack. The rest of the minks followed his example as they blew the rest of the Pleasures away with Electro, and Monjii told Jack that the minks were all born warriors who would step up to defend their country in a heartbeat. Once again, he offered to have the Duke talk to Jack peacefully, but Jack refused any sort of talk as he ordered his Gifters, people with strange animal-like appearances, to attack.
Back in the present, the Straw Hats are all shocked by the story, with Luffy being excited to hear about a mammoth and Brook quietly explaining that this is why he told them not to mention samurai or Wano Country. Luffy then sees that they are on a suspension bridge and rocks it for fun, scaring and infuriating his crewmates. As Wanda continues talking about the Beasts Pirates' search for Raizo, A crestfallen Luffy states that this probably means the ninja Kin'emon talked about was not here, which mortifies his crewmates as Wanda perks up her ears.","Trafalgar D.

Episode 758,Ruler of Day - Duke Inuarashi Appears!,2-Oct-16,"The Straw Hats and Wanda reach Inuarashi's sanatorium, where they meet the Duke as well as his subordinate Shishilian. As night falls and Inuarashi and his subjects fall asleep, Wanda tells the Straw Hats about how Inuarashi and the Musketeers arrived and fought against Jack.","Wanda turns around in confusion after hearing Luffy mention a ninja. Usopp, Nami, and Brook immediately start beating Luffy up, and try telling Wanda that they are doing so to show him minkship. However, Wanda knows she heard something about a ninja, and Brook claims on the spot that Luffy was wondering about how the kanja (patient) was doing. Wanda is relieved that the Straw Hats care so much about Inuarashi, and the group draws closer to the Duke's sanatorium. At the sanatorium entrance, a lion mink named Shishilian is throwing other minks into a pit for mentioning sweet things around him. The minks are in awe at Shishilian's intensity but are grateful for his tough love and generosity. However, the mention of such pleasant traits angers Shishilian and causes him to throw part of the sanatorium at them. Wanda and the Straw Hats then meet Shishilian, and Wanda introduces the Straw Hats to them. Shishilian immediately bows down with high intensity and thanks the Straw Hats for saving his country before asking who their captain is. After Luffy steps forward, Shishilian hugs him with great force and displays intense gratitude, rubbing against Luffy's face so fast it starts to burn.
Shishilian leads the Straw Hats into the sanatorium, where Chopper, Miyagi, and Tristan are tending to Inuarashi. The Straw Hats stare in awe at the massive canine mink as Wanda emotionally embraces him, and Inuarashi thanks the Straw Hats for saving his country. Luffy replies that he knows his crew did that despite him not knowing the whole story, and Inuarashi reveals that Luffy's group also helped save them too. Luffy then remarks that Inuarashi looks very strong, and Wanda is shocked at Luffy's rudeness, saying that Inuarashi is the strongest warrior in the country. Inuarashi deflects the statement by reminding Wanda that he was defeated, although Wanda states that they had the upper hand regardless. Inuarashi then turns his attention to Brook and salivates at the thought of chewing him, though he decides to wait for Brook to recover from his injuries. Inuarashi then takes note of the straw hat on Luffy's head, revealing that he and Nekomamushi had once set out to sea and met Shanks. When Luffy attempts to reply, Inuarashi suddenly falls asleep, shocking him. Wanda reveals that the two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, hated each other so much that they would easily fight should they encounter each other. Thus, each ruler takes turns ruling, with Inuarashi ruling from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM while Nekomamushi rules during the other 12 hours. Everyone in Inuarashi's domain is asleep, including Miyagi, Tristan, and Shishilian.
Wanda reveals that the ruler switch took place even in the intense battle with Jack 17 days ago. During the battle, the mink citizens continued repelling the Pleasures with Electro, although Jack easily overpowered them. The Gifters then arrived and started overpowering the minks with their unusual abilities. Right then, the Inuarashi Musketeer Squad came racing in, and the citizens retreated to leave the fighting to them. The Musketeers easily overpowered the Pleasures, but were shocked by the strange powers of the Gifters. Wanda took on one of the Gifters and disarmed him, but the Gifter overpowered her by turning his arm into a wolf's head. However, Shishilian arrived and cut down the Gifter as he and two others, known as the Three Inuarashi Musketeers, arrived. The Three Inuarashi Musketeers easily overwhelmed the Gifters with tremendous power, and Shishilian attacked Jack, but Jack managed to repel him with his trunk after a brief struggle. Right then, Inuarashi arrived on a crocodile-boar steed and told Jack to stop the attack as the two leaders confronted each other.","Usopp, Wanda, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 759,Ruler of Night - Master Nekomamushi Emerges,9-Oct-16,"17 days ago, Inuarashi and Jack fought evenly while the Musketeers continued battling the Beasts Pirates. The battle briefly turned in the Musketeers' favor when the Eruption Rain arrived, but the enemy pirates quickly recovered. However, when 6:00 PM arrived, Inuarashi and the Musketeers departed, and the Guardians led by Nekomamushi arrived. Nekomamushi dealt a large blow to Jack, causing the Disaster to return to human form, and the two leaders clashed.","17 days ago, Inuarashi arrived at the scene of the battle, confronting Jack and the Beasts Pirates and pleading for them to stop their senseless attack. The Beasts Pirates refused to stop until they found Raizo, despite the minks' continued pleas that they did not know him. Tensions rose and the two sides prepared to resume fighting, but Inuarashi shouted for them to wait as he dismounted his steed and approached Jack alone. He unsheathed and raised his sword, but unexpectedly dropped it as he offered Jack the chance to search the entire island peacefully. However, Jack refused and swung his trunk at Inuarashi. The minks were shocked and fearful for their Duke's fate, while the Beasts Pirates were gleeful. Wanda attempted to attack them in anger, but Shishilian held her back as the dust cleared. Inuarashi could then be seen standing and holding Jack's trunk back, relieving the minks and shocking the pirates. The pirates expressed their surprise that the minks had such a strong fighter, although one of them stated that they had nothing to worry about since they followed Jack, a powerful pirate with a bounty of 1,000,000,000. Jack expressed annoyance at his subordinate's boasting, and told Inuarashi that he would only call off his attack once Raizo had been found. Inuarashi was appalled by Jack's lack of reason, and the pirate also stated that he liked causing destruction. Inuarashi then resigned himself to the fact that battle was their only option, and he ordered the Musketeers to attack.
The battle raged on, with the minks using Electro and the Gifters using their animal powers to attack each other. Inuarashi and Jack fought each other one-on-one, and Inuarashi ran up Jack's trunk before driving his Electro-imbued sword into the pirate's head. The attack caused Jack to sway into a nearby building, demolishing it, and the minks grew excited. However, Jack quickly emerged from the wreckage and stated that such an attack would not work on him before charging. Inuarashi said that this was how the gate to the Mokomo Dukedom was destroyed, and he meets Jack's challenge as he swings his sword at the pirate's head, creating a massive clash. Back in the present, the Straw Hat Pirates react in surprise at the account of the large amount of power both sides had. However, Luffy does not care as he says that he will beat Jack someday. Zoro wonders about the outcome of the battle, and Wanda states that it got more intense from there. Inuarashi and Jack continued their clash, with Jack overpowering the Duke and throwing him into a building, although Inuarashi escaped before Jack could slam into him. Three Gifters, known as the Gifters Grip Trio, slaughtered some Musketeers before confronting the Three Inuarashi Musketeers. Shishilian stated that the Three Musketeers would win a 3-on-3 battle, although he quickly dispatched the Gifters Grip Trio by himself immediately afterwards. As the battle continued, Zunesha lifted up its trunk as an Eruption Rain began; the sudden deluge of water swept away the Beasts Pirates, although Jack stood strong and could not be moved. The minks rode crocodile-boar steeds as they overwhelmed the disoriented pirates, although several of them recovered, attempting to fight back and hijack the steeds. Though the minks had the upper hand during the flood, the pirates easily recovered once the water drained and the battle continued.
Much time passed, and the visibly worn Musketeers continued fighting the pirates as the sun began to set. Right then, the clock struck 6:00 PM, and a loud cry came out from the Whale Forest. Inuarashi ordered his troops to retreat, saying that the shift system would still be in place despite the ongoing battle. He then told Jack to not think that he was the only unreasonable man in the city, and the Musketeers vanished from the city. The Guardians, led by Nekomamushi, then raced into the city, with an angry Nekomamushi making threats against the invaders before grabbing Jack by the trunk and flipping him on his back. As Nekomamushi licked his paws, Jack returned to his human form and unsheathed his weapons. The Guardians prepared to battle the Beasts Pirates, when the Heart Pirates suddenly came in to help them. Nekomamushi told Bepo that he was not obligated to fight, but Bepo was determined to defend his homeland, pleasing Nekomamushi. He and Jack then began their clash.","Ginrummy (flashback), Sheepshead (flashback), Wanda, Carrot (flashback), Concelot (flashback), Giovanni (flashback), Jack (flashback), Wany (flashback), Inuarashi, Shishilian, Brook, Monkey D.

Episode 760,The Exterminated Capital - The Curly Hat Pirates Arrive!,16-Oct-16,"Wanda continues telling the Straw Hats about the Mink Tribe's battle with Jack, revealing that it lasted for five days. On the fifth day, however, Jack lost his patience and subdued the minks with a poisonous gas. The Beasts Pirates proceeded to slaughter many minks, and they crucified Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, and the strongest mink warriors, torturing them for a day. However, Jack left at the end of the day, and in the present Inuarashi reveals that Jack left in order to rescue Doflamingo, meaning that the Straw Hats on Dressrosa had helped save the minks.
The day after Jack's departure, Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, Momonosuke, and Caesar Clown reached Zou, and Sanji took Chopper and Caesar further into the destroyed Mokomo Dukedom. Soon afterward, the others witnessed Tristan being pursued by Sheepshead and Ginrummy, and they managed to let Tristan escape. Meanwhile, Sanji, Chopper, and Caesar entered the gas-covered Kurau City, and a barely conscious Pedro begged them to save Inuarashi and Nekomamushi.","While night still reigns over the Mokomo Dukedom, Wanda continues telling the Straw Hats about the Mink Tribe's battle with Jack, revealing that it lasted five days. 17 days ago, Nekomamushi began an intense and fast-paced clash with Jack, and the mink was surprised that the pirate could keep up with his staff. He managed to get close to Jack and knock him down, although Jack retaliated by knocking the mink a fair distance back. Jack then charged at Nekomamushi, but the mink blocked the attack by spinning his spear. Nekomamushi then sped around Jack and jumped between a few buildings before successfully knocking the pirate off balance. He then prepared a finishing blow, but Jack managed to recover and counter it, although Nekomamushi managed to kick him in the forehead. Jack was unfazed by the blow as he wiped away the mark it left, and Nekomamushi noted that Jack was much tougher to defeat than he anticipated. However, his curious demeanor quickly changed into a ferocious one as he shouted he would kill Jack; the pirate only replied that he would like to see the mink try.
Eventually, 6:00 AM arrived and the Guardians retreated, to the Beasts Pirates' exasperation. Nekomamushi told an unwilling Bepo to retreat before telling Jack to not let Inuarashi kill him so he could finish the pirate off the next night. Inuarashi and the Musketeers then arrived, and the Gifters decided to attack Inuarashi, but were thwarted by the Musketeers as their leader resumed his battle with Jack. Inuarashi managed to overwhelm Jack and knock him into a building, and he complained that because of this he had to smell Nekomamushi's scent, but Jack emerged from the wreckage and knocked him into the building on the opposite side. Inuarashi recovered from the blow, and the two continued to clash. The Musketeers and the Guardians rotated in and out of battle for the next five days, and despite the Beasts Pirates sending in reinforcements from their fleet in the ocean below, the minks eventually managed to get the upper hand. However, they could not overwhelm Jack himself, although Jack was equally unable to take down Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, which resulted in him growing impatient and ending the battle with a poisonous gas weapon.
In the present, the Straw Hats are shocked to hear about this, and Chopper reveals that Jack used one of Caesar Clown's gas weapons to destroy this country. Robin deduces that these weapons made their way from Caesar to Doflamingo, who trafficked it to Kaidou, Jack's captain, and Luffy gets angry at Caesar. 12 days ago, the gas spread into Kurau City, immediately causing Wanda, Inuarashi, and all the other Musketeers to fall to the ground. Except for the ones who retreated to the back of the Rightflank Fortress, most of the minks were subdued and slaughtered, as the Beasts Pirates took pleasure in repeating their question about the samurai that the minks had repeatedly claimed to not know before killing them. In the present, Wanda grows emotional as she recounts the atrocity, but she continues, revealing that the Guardians were also subdued and attacked. However, the pirates were still getting no answer, so they crucified and tortured the strongest mink warriors, including Inuarashi and Nekomamushi. They continued interrogating the minks about the samurai, and the determined Inuarashi and Nekomamushi continued denying any knowledge of one, causing a wrathful Jack to attack both of them. The torture lasted for a full day before Jack departed from Zou, leaving behind some of his men. In the present, Inuarashi reveals that the Straw Hats had caused this, and the pirates are surprised that he is awake. Inuarashi says that he read Jack's obituary and realized that he had tried to rescue Doflamingo, whom the Straw Hats on Dressrosa had brought down. Thus, the Straw Hats had spared them from further attack, and Wanda is even more grateful toward them.
Chopper then reveals that he, Sanji, Nami, Brook, Momonosuke, and Caesar arrived on Zou the day after Jack left. They were all bewildered that Zou was located on an elephant, and Caesar tried convincing them not to enter, but they forced him to carry them up there like a hot air balloon. They went through the destroyed gate, and surveyed the heavily damaged Mokomo Dukedom, with the possibility of invaders putting them on edge. Sanji left Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke at the gate as he took Chopper and Caesar on ahead, and Chopper had to hit Caesar to get him moving. As Sanji, Chopper, and Caesar surveyed the land ahead, Brook, Nami, and Momonosuke pondered about what happened to the country. Suddenly, they heard Tristan cry out for help as she emerged from the forest being chased by Sheepshead and Ginrummy on a crocodile-boar steed. Nami deduced that she was a victim and Sheepshead was a villain, so she pulled Tristan toward safety. Sheepshead turned around as he gleefully stated his desire to torture and interrogate Tristan. Nami left the pirates to Brook, and Sheepshead was appalled at Brook's skeletal appearance. Brook then used Soul Solid to freeze the ground around them, causing Sheepshead and Ginrummy's steed to slip and fall. However, Tristan was frightened by Brook and Momonosuke's strange appearances and ran away, causing the Straw Hats to chase after her, and an enraged Sheepshead got up with the intent of pursuing the pirates. Meanwhile, Sanji, Chopper, and Caesar discovered the gas-covered Kurau City, and were shocked by all the subdued minks lying in the streets. As they prepared to leave in order to avoid succumbing to the gas, Pedro called out to them. The heavily injured mink deduced that the pirates were not on Jack's side and begged them to save Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, saying the world is waiting for them. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi are seen unconscious at their crucifixes, with Inuarashi missing his left leg and Nekomamushi missing his left forearm.","Shishilian, Franky, Inuarashi, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 761,The Time Limit Closes in - The Bond Between the Mink Tribe and the Crew!,23-Oct-16,"10 days ago, the Curly Hat Pirates discovered the incapacitated minks, and Caesar Clown was tasked with neutralizing the gas weapon he created, Koro, while Sanji went to save Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke from Sheepshead. After the Beasts Pirates were finally chased off of Zou, the Straw Hats went back to Kurau City and interacted with the conscious minks. Chopper and Caesar then prepared and administered an antidote for the poisoning, saving the Mink Tribe.
In the present, Wanda and the Straw Hats go off to the Whale Forest to see Nekomamushi.","In Duke Inuarashi's sanatorium, Chopper continues telling his crew about the Curly Hat Pirates' arrival on Zou 10 days ago, saying that he, Sanji, and Caesar Clown departed from Kurau City in order to get away from the gas. They convened inside the nearby forest, and Caesar started giggling with glee that his gas weapon, Koro, was a success. Chopper and Sanji were shocked and angry that Caesar created the gas used to incapacitate the minks, although Caesar denied any responsibility for the minks' plight, causing Chopper to beat him up. Caesar also mentioned that the minks likely had less than 48 hours left to live after exposure, angering Chopper and Sanji even more. Suddenly, Zunesha lifted up its trunk and sprayed water onto Zou, causing a flood that swept away Chopper and Caesar. Sanji used Sky Walk to travel over the flood, picking Chopper up and kicking Caesar onto a nearby tree branch, which he and Chopper landed on as well. Caesar was angry at Sanji, but they suddenly heard Nami crying out, and Sanji ordered Caesar to neutralize Koro while he rescued Nami and the others, convincing the scientist to do so by threatening to crush his heart. Sanji flew over to Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke, who were being attacked by Sheepshead. Sanji defeated Sheepshead with a Diable Jambe kick, causing Ginrummy and the other Beasts Pirates to retreat from the island and report that the samurai was not present.
Meanwhile, Chopper and Caesar returned to Kurau City, and Caesar spread a gas called Roko that removed Koro from the air, causing some of the minks to stir. Chopper called out to his crewmates, who ran from the forest to Kurau City, not knowing that Tristan was watching them. Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke were shocked to see the destruction, and they entered the city carefully, not knowing what the minks were like. Suddenly, Wanda came rushing at them, thinking they were allied with Jack. She clashed with Nami, and Nami managed to overpower her, but the weakened Wanda was intent on avenging her people, so she pulled out a lit explosive. However, Tristan came running to them, telling Wanda that the Curly Hat Pirates had saved her, and Pedro then arrived, affirming Tristan's statement and putting out the fuse of the explosive. Wanda grew emotional to hear that they had helpers, and Pedro showed her that the gas had been cleared away. Chopper and Caesar then arrived with medical supplies, with the former being determined to heal all the minks in the short time they had left.
The Straw Hats and the conscious minks mobilized to create an antidote, with Tristan retrieving the mink doctors and citizens hiding in the Rightflank Fortress. Chopper and Caesar started developing the antidote as the mink citizens came to Kurau City, expressing shock at seeing the incapacitated warriors. Eventually, the antidote was finished and administered to all of the poisoned minks, and the unconscious Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were removed from their crucifixes. As night fell, Sanji brought hot soup for the minks to eat, and Brook played Binks' Sake to the crowd of cured minks.
Back in the present, Chopper finishes his story as his crewmates are pleased to hear about the services the Curly Hats did. Luffy gets angry at Jack again for poisoning the minks and expresses his desire to take down the pirate, although he is reminded that Jack received an obituary. However, Wanda expresses her doubt about Jack's death, remembering his monstrous strength. Chopper and Wanda then prepare to go see and tend to Nekomamushi, and Robin asks Wanda about her sleep schedule. Wanda reveals that as a ruler's aide, she can be active at all hours of the day and go anywhere on Zou to communicate with both rulers. She wants to tell Nekomamushi about Inuarashi's state, and the Straw Hats wish to go with her and Chopper to see Nekomamushi.","Tony Tony Chopper, Shishilian (flashback), Caesar Clown (flashback), Monkey D.

As the Curly Hat Pirates continued helping the minks, Pekoms had a happy reunion with his kinfolk. Sanji and Brook confronted the two Big Mom Pirates, and Pekoms revealed that they had a mission that would tear the Straw Hats apart. However, he was so grateful to them that he would willingly fail the mission. This angered Bege, who barraged his comrade in the back with rapid-fire gunshots.","As Wanda, Carrot, and the Straw Hat Pirates go off to see Nekomamushi, Wanda remarks on the full moon in the sky, saying she is glad it is covered by clouds. Luffy then says that Sanji and Caesar Clown were still present on Zou in her story, asking her what happened to them later. Wanda hesitates, and Brook decides to explain it himself. He tells the Straw Hats that most of the minks were not told about this, and this may be hard for them to hear. He then reveals that Sanji is likely not coming back, which angers Luffy, who pointed to the note Sanji left, which states that he would be back. However, Nami and Brook reply that the situation is far more complicated than what the note suggests, and that it may have been better to tell the story before showing the note.
Brook then tells the story, explaining how when they were being pursued by the Big Mom Pirates, the enemy pirates overheard Luffy's call to the Sunny crew revealing that their destination was Zou. Although Zou was a Phantom Island that could not be found with a Log Pose, one of their Big Mom Pirates was from the island, and so two days ago their ship docked at Zou. On the ship, Pekoms contacted Big Mom, telling her to leave the expedition to him as he was a native Zou. Later, Pekoms and Capone Bege made it onto Zou and into the Mokomo Dukedom, where they discovered the destroyed Kurau City. Pekoms flew into a rage upon seeing his hometown destroyed, and looked around for survivors but found none, causing him to scream in anguish.
Inside the Rightflank Fortress, Sanji prepared meals for the minks, who loved them, and afterwards he went out to interact with the female minks. As Chopper, Miyagi, and Tristan treated patients, Sanji nuzzled with female minks in their traditional greeting known as ""minkship"", but wanted nothing to do with male minks, leaving them disappointed. Meanwhile, Wanda outfitted Nami with a dress, revealing that exchanging clothes was a big part of mink culture and that the dress was a natural treasure, causing Nami to get excited at the prospect of selling it for big money. Sanji then saw Nami in the dress, causing him to race at her in excitement, but she punched him out of the fortress. Meanwhile, Chopper asked Brook where Momonosuke was, and Brook revealed that he was still in his room, though it was for the best that the minks not see him in his human form. Caesar Clown said that they should abandon him and leave the island as soon as possible, but Chopper got angry at the suggestion, telling him to continue working on treatments for the minks. A mink came to collect treatments from Caesar, but the scientist, mortified at his name being associated with humanitarian treatment, disguised himself. The mink told Brook that his fans were outside, which were dogs looking to chew on the skeleton, and Brook was not inclined to go out and meet them.
At the Fortress gate, the two guards braced themselves as two strangers came up to them, but realized that one of them was Pekoms. Pekoms bawled with happiness as he saw his fellow minks alive, and embraced the two guards. He asked if the Straw Hats had done the damage to the Mokomo Dukedom, but ultimately concluded that they did before the guards could correct him, causing him to go into a fit of rage. Pekoms then entered the Rightflank Fortress, where he reunited with his family and more of his kinfolk. The minks revealed to him that Jack and the Beasts Pirates had destroyed the country while the Straw Hats had saved them, causing Pekoms to curse Jack. The Straw Hats saw Pekoms and Bege from a balcony, and Caesar grew afraid and asked for the Straw Hats' continued protection, but Sanji replied that since Luffy defeated Doflamingo, Caesar was no longer of any worth to them as a trump card. Out of curiosity, Sanji asked why the Big Mom Pirates wanted Caesar, and the scientist replied that he had taken money to fund a commission Big Mom gave him, but he spent it on other things; Sanji replied that he deserved what was coming. Caesar offered to assist Sanji in eliminating the Big Mom Pirates, and the Curly Hats realized that they may be in trouble as well since Luffy had declared war with Big Mom on Fish-Man Island. However, Sanji refused Caesar's advances, and told Brook to come with him and the rest to stay as he made eye contact with Bege.
Back in the present, the Straw Hats remark on two Four Emperors crews being on Zou in such a short timespan, and Luffy wonders if Sanji fought Pekoms, as he does not really care due to having declared war on Big Mom. Brook continues his story, revealing that Sanji and Brook went out with Pekoms and Bege. Sanji was willing to face the two pirates head-on, but stated that if a fight was in order they would have to do it outside of Zou. However, a tearful Pekoms embraced Sanji, shocking the Straw Hats and Bege. Pekoms thanked Sanji for saving his people, and revealed to him that in addition to capturing Caesar, their crew had another mission that would likely tear the Straw Hats apart. However, out of gratitude, he was willing to purposely fail that mission as long as they got Caesar. Bege reprimanded Pekoms, but the mink silenced the newer member of the crew, saying he would take any punishment Big Mom gave him. This caused Bege to grow angry and call Pekoms a coward as he raised his hand toward the kneeling mink's back. Suddenly, a rapid stream of bullets emerged from Bege's hand, striking Pekoms in the back.","Wanda, Nami, Wany, Monkey D.

Episode 763,The Truth Behind The Disappearance - Sanji Gets a Startling Invitation,6-Nov-16,"Two days earlier, Capone Bege used a surprise ambush to surround Sanji and Brook and capture Nami, Chopper, and Caesar. He took them inside his body, which is a fortress due to the power of the Shiro Shiro no Mi. There, he extended an invitation to Sanji, the third son of the Vinsmoke Family, revealing that he was set to marry Pudding of the Charlotte Family, which was ruled by Big Mom. A shocked Sanji refused, but Bege threatened him and his crewmates, and Bege's crewmate Vito whispered something in Sanji's ear, which shocked him.","Two days ago, Pekoms collapsed as Capone Bege finished shooting him, and a shocked Sanji and Brook noticed two men with machine guns in an opening in the palm of Bege's hand. Bege reflected that Pekoms was cowardly and weak for letting his feelings interfere with business, and told his men to come out. A door opened in Bege's chest, and several miniature gunmen ran out, turning to normal size upon crossing a red barrier around Bege's body. Bege's men surrounded Sanji and Brook, and Bege revealed that he ate the Shiro Shiro no Mi, which allowed his body to become a fortress. He then told them about how he was in the same generation as their captain, and reflected on the trouble Luffy caused him on Sabaody Archipelago when he was forced to fight the Marines. Bege stated that he wished to not make a scene here, as he knew about the minks' strength. Sanji replied that he did not want the minks involved either, and he and Brook prepared to fight against the Fire Tank Pirates. However, Bege knew they would do that and called out to Vito, who brought the captured Nami and Chopper along with him. Vito informed Bege that Caesar Clown was hiding in a nearby tree. Bege threatened to shoot the scientist with seastone bullets, which caused him to fall out of the tree. However, Bege revealed that he had no seastone bullets, but he did have a seastone staff, which one of his subordinates held onto Caesar. Bege then ordered the captured Curly Hats to go into his body fortress.
In the present, Luffy wonders how his crewmates went inside Bege's body, and is reprimanded for forgetting about Bege's ability. Brook continues his story, revealing that they were brought into Bege's body fortress in chains, except for Sanji, who sat at a long banquet table. Bege then appeared in his fortress as a purple liquid before solidifying into his normal body, and offered Sanji some wine as he sat at the other end of the table. As Vito lit his cigar, Bege revealed that the Big Mom Pirates' intentions had changed since the two crews fought a week ago, and he tossed Sanji an invitation to Big Mom's Tea Party. Sanji was confused, but Bege read the contents, revealing that Sanji, as the third son of the Vinsmoke Family, was arranged to marry Pudding of the Charlotte Family. Sanji and his crewmates were appalled, and Sanji's cigarette fell out of his mouth as it gaped open in shock.
Sanji's cigarette fell to the floor and caught on fire, causing an angry Bege to quickly stamp it out. Bege called Sanji ill-bred, and Brook stated that the name Vinsmoke sent chills down his spine. Nami, Brook, and Chopper struggled to process the revelation about Sanji, and Nami recalled how Sanji revealed that he was from the North Blue, though grew up in the East Blue, when they read Liar Noland on Jaya. Brook was surprised to hear this, as the North Blue and the East Blue are separated by the Red Line, which very few people could travel across. Caesar then revealed to them that Pudding was Big Mom's daughter, meaning that they would likely become Big Mom's subordinates if Sanji got married, which scared them. Sanji refused to go to the tea party and get married, but Bege replied that the invitation was for him to see, not for him to respond to. The pirate then revealed that his body was moving with them inside it, and that he had full control over it. He manipulated the chandeliers and rugs into knives and cannons pointed at Sanji as he caused Nami to sink into the ground, displaying his unlimited power over his fortress. Sanji shouted at him to stop, and Bege did, stating that Big Mom's invitation could not be refused no matter what. Vito then walked over to Sanji and reiterated his captain's point, saying even the demons of hell would come to Big Mom's tea parties if they were invited. Vito then whispered something into Sanji's ear which shocked him, and Sanji asked how they knew that, which Bege called a silly question.","Capone Bege (flashback), Sanji (flashback), Brook, Pekoms (flashback), Nami, Vito (flashback), Tony Tony Chopper, Caesar Clown (flashback), Monkey D.

Episode 764,To My Buds - Sanji's Farewell Note,13-Nov-16,"Two days ago, Sanji wrote a note for his crewmates, but while giving it to Nami, Chopper, and Brook, he seized the opportunity and threw them out of Capone Bege's body. Sanji then held Caesar Clown at gunpoint, knowing that the two of them were valuable to the Big Mom Pirates and the person planning the wedding, and he agreed to go to the wedding peacefully as long as his crewmates were kept safe. Because of this, and the arrival of Nekomamushi, Bege was forced to escape from Zou with Sanji and Caesar in tow.
Back in the present, after debating what to do about the situation, Luffy decides to find Sanji and ask him about his situation.","Two days ago, after Vito whispered something into Sanji's ear, a shocked Sanji asked Capone Bege how they knew that. Bege called that a silly question, telling Sanji that Big Mom possesses unfathomable power and influence, allowing her to find out and do anything she wants. Sanji took more puffs from his cigarette as Nami, Chopper, and Brook asked what Vito had told him, and he asked Bege for a pen and paper. Bege obliged, and Sanji wrote a note on the paper before handing it to Nami. He told his chained crewmates that he never expected to deal with this part of his heritage, and that he needed to go and sort things out by himself. As his crewmates got confused, Sanji asked them if they were ready before hurling them out of Bege's body.
As Nami, Chopper, and Brook returned to normal size and hit the ground, an appalled Caesar Clown wondered why Sanji did not free him as Sanji started attacking the panicked Fire Tank Pirates. Vito warned his crewmates that they could not harm the Straw Hat, and Sanji kicked one pirate's gun into the air. He then grabbed the gun and slammed Caesar's head into the floor with his foot, pointing the gun at the scientist. As Caesar writhed in anger and the Fire Tank Pirates took aim, Sanji shouted at them that he knew they could not touch him, as he had figured out that the person who changed the condition of his bounty to ""Only Alive"" was the same person arranging the wedding. Thus, the person did not want the Fire Tank Pirates to harm him in any way. Sanji agreed to go to the wedding with the pirates as long as his crewmates were spared, and Bege ordered his men to stand back as he noticed Nekomamushi standing behind his real body.
Bege grew nervous to see the monstrous mink, and Nekomamushi asked about Pekoms' body. Bege claimed that the two of them were crewmates and that Pekoms had been taken out by remnants of Jack's forces. Nami then came and contested his story, which Bege denied as she, Chopper, and Brook looked inside Bege's body to see Sanji. Sanji turned toward them and promised to come back as Bege closed the openings into his body. The pirate captain then leaped away and manifested tank treads around his legs, allowing him to speed away. Nami raced after him but failed to catch up, and Sanji's note flew off of Nami, coming unfolded as it landed on the ground. Wanda then arrived to help the Straw Hats, but Nekomamushi stopped her. Brook came to the realization that Sanji would likely not come back as the contents of his note were revealed, which stated that he was going to meet a woman and would be back. As the Guardians tended to the Straw Hats and removed their chains, Nekomamushi told Wanda to let the Straw Hats keep the details of the incident to themselves, as it was what they wanted. He also had his soldiers transport the injured Pekoms to medical care before leaping into a bush of silver vine.
Back in the present, the Straw Hats process the news, and Luffy wonders if Sanji will come back with his wife. However, Brook reminds him that the bride is Big Mom's daughter, meaning that they would become Big Mom's subordinates. Thus, it seemed as though Sanji went alone in order to cut himself off from the crew and deal with the situation himself, preventing the Straw Hats from falling under Big Mom's control. Usopp reflects on the Vinsmoke name, noting that they had journeyed from the North Blue to the East Blue and then to the New World, which is a very considerable feat; Robin states that she recognizes the name. Nami apologizes for allowing him to leave before the rest of the crew got here, and Robin is fine, though Chopper is not since he does not know if Sanji is coming back. However, Zoro is fine with that, as he states that Sanji had put them into more trouble. They were already in conflict with Kaidou due to crippling his SMILE trade and going against his crew, and now Sanji had gotten involved with another Emperor, Big Mom. Some of the Straw Hats get angry at Zoro, but Luffy interjects, stating the only thing they could do now is go into Big Mom's territory and find Sanji to ask about his motivations. His crewmates are appalled at the idea of invading an Emperor's territory, but Brook states that the Big Mom Pirates left behind someone who could help them. He then focuses back on the present, intent on continuing the journey to Nekomamushi.","Capone Bege (flashback), Sanji (flashback), Nami, Charlotte Linlin (fantasy), Napoleon (fantasy), Tony Tony Chopper, Brook, Vito (flashback), Caesar Clown (flashback), Nekomamushi (flashback), Pekoms (flashback), Wanda, Carrot, Blackback (flashback), Roddy (flashback), Wany, Monkey D.

Episode 765,Let's Go See Master Nekomamushi,20-Nov-16,"While on the way to the Whale Forest, the Straw Hats, Wanda, and Carrot battle a swarm of bloodsucking insects called Sutchies. Afterwards, Brook sings a song about Nekomamushi.
The group reaches the Whale Forest Residential District, where they meet the Guardians including their captain Pedro. They then meet Nekomamushi, who is playing around and violating his orders to rest. As Chopper treats his wounds, Luffy and Nami meet with Pekoms, who reveals that Sanji's family is a family of killers and leads a legendary Underworld army known as Germa 66.","As the Straw Hats, Wanda, and Carrot ride to the Whale Forest, Brook reveals that Pekoms had agreed to spare their crew from Big Mom's plan out of gratitude for them saving his people, but this proved to be his undoing as Capone Bege shot him and left him on the island. However, because of this, the Straw Hats could now gain information on Big Mom's location, and Luffy promises to get Sanji back from her. As Usopp wonders what condition the lion mink is in, a swarm of yellow insects flies toward the group. Wanda and Carrot reveal that the insects are bloodsuckers known as Sutchies, and they can easily kill humans due to their lack of fur. Wanda reveals that the Sutchies are also capable of feeding on and weakening Zunesha, and the Sutchies bite into the steed Luffy's group is riding on, causing it to fall to the ground. The Straw Hats recover and battle the Sutchies, and Franky uses his Nipple Light to lure the Sutchies to him. Wanda prepares to help exterminate the Sutchies as one of them bites into Luffy, although the pirate manages to repel it by covering his arms in Armament Haki. The Straw Hats and Wanda all unleash powerful attacks on the Sutchies, sending the remainder of the swarm falling to the ground. Wanda thanks the Straw Hats for their continued help, and the group resumes their journey to see Nekomamushi. Brook then sings a song about going to see Nekomamushi, which initially consists of him saying the same line over and over, to Luffy's confusion. Brook then sings about how Nekomamushi lives a lonely life before concluding, and the Straw Hats wonder if Nekomamushi was like that. However, Brook admits that he only made the events of song up, shocking them.
The group then reaches the Whale Forest Residential District under the giant Whale Tree, and the Guardians cheer for the oncoming Straw Hats. Luffy is greeted by Roddy and Blackback, who apologize to him for attacking him earlier, saying they sometimes get too zealous against intruders. Pedro then calls out to Straw Hats from a tree, thanking them for saving the Mink Tribe and seconding the apology to Luffy, as he was present during the attack. He then leaps down from the tree and tells Luffy that the Heart Pirates are waiting for them in the back, but Luffy wants to see Nekomamushi and Pekoms first. Upon hearing Luffy mention Pekoms, Pedro nuzzles up to Luffy. He whispers to Luffy that Pekoms is recovering in the back of the main building, but the details of the attempt on his life have not been made public to the other minks. He then confides that he knows Sanji is in a predicament, and offers the Guardians' help. A female reindeer mink named Milky then arrives to take Chopper to see Nekomamushi, and Chopper becomes smitten with her. However, Milky reveals that Nekomamushi is currently taking a bath, shocking Chopper.
Inside the main building, Nekomamushi eats lasagna while taking a bath, and Chopper rushes in, yelling at him angrily for doing so as his wounds would reopen. Nekomamushi refuses to accept such restrictions due to his love of freedom as he climbs out of the tub, and he hugs the other Straw Hats in gratitude. In the middle of the embrace, Nekomamushi spots a bouncing ball, causing him to leap after it and reopen his wounds. He is then sent to bed, and Chopper prepares to administer an injection to him. Fearing the pain of a needle, Nekomamushi has Robin wave foxtail in front of him, distracting him enough for Chopper to give him the shot. Meanwhile, Luffy, Nami, Wanda, Carrot, and Pedro meet with Pekoms, who reveals that he survived by absorbing many of Bege's bullets with his Devil Fruit power. He apologizes for not being able to keep Sanji out of captivity, and Luffy asks him who is arranging the wedding. Pekoms replies that it is Big Mom and Sanji's father, the patriarch of the Vinsmoke Family. The father is an infamous man in the Underworld, and leads an army known as Germa 66. Nami is shocked to hear this, thinking Germa 66 is a mythical army, but Pekoms affirms its reality, stating that Sanji comes from a family of killers.","Wany, Roronoa Zoro, Brook, Monkey D.

Episode 766,Luffy's Decision - Sanji on the Brink of Quitting!,27-Nov-16,"Pekoms tells Luffy that although the Straw Hats will not have to serve under Big Mom, the Emperor's great power will ensure that Sanji gets married and remains separate from his crew forever. However, Luffy decides to go to Big Mom's territory and ask Sanji whether or not he wants to get married, forcing Pekoms to take him along despite the lion mink's pleas.
Luffy then meets Nekomamushi and reunites with the Heart Pirates. Law pulls him aside and Luffy reveals his intention to enter Big Mom's territory, but Law reminds him that Kaidou knows Zou's location and is very likely to attack them in the future. Law's concern for Zou moves the Guardians to tears, and they throw a party to celebrate the Straw Hats and Heart Pirates.
Robin, Franky, and Brook guard the entrance to Zou in order to prevent Kin'emon and Kanjuro from entering, as they believe the minks will not take kindly to allies of Raizo. However, they fall asleep, and the next morning, the samurai and Bariete make it to the entrance. Bariete then discovers Kin'emon and Kanjuro's allegiance, and runs off in tears to reveal the samurai's arrival.","After Pekoms reveals that Sanji comes from a family of killers, Luffy replies that he does not care, and only wants to know if Sanji will come back or not. He states that although he is fine with Sanji getting married, he does not want to serve Big Mom, and so the Big Mom Pirates will have to serve him instead. The audacious statement causes Pekoms to go hysterical and bump his head on the wall, causing him to bounce and fall out of bed, which inflames his wounds. Luffy and Carrot laugh at Pekoms' display, and as Pekoms gets back into bed, he reveals that Sanji has no choice about attending the wedding, as anyone who refuses Tea Party invitations will receive a gruesome present: the decapitated head of someone close to them. Big Mom could easily give Sanji the head of one of his crewmates, or one of his fellow cooks from Baratie, or even someone from the Kamabakka Kingdom, as her status as an Emperor allows her enough power to do anything she wants.
Nami notes that this may have been what Vito whispered to Sanji two days ago, and Pekoms reveals to Luffy that the marriage will not force the Straw Hats to serve Big Mom, as the Emperor is only interested in Sanji's family. However, Pekoms says that the marriage will mean Sanji will no longer be part of the Straw Hats, which causes an angry Luffy to throttle him by his shirt collar. Luffy refuses to accept the possibility of Sanji leaving, and as he forces Pekoms onto the floor, he asks the mink what he is going to do. Pekoms replies that he will head back to Big Mom after he recovers in order to get back at Capone Bege for attacking him, and Luffy tells the mink to take him along. Nami protests, and Luffy tells her that he will be going alone in order to better infiltrate Big Mom's territory. Pekoms tries to dissuade Luffy as well, and Carrot gets excited at Luffy's plan, causing Wanda to reprimand her. Pekoms' protests fall on deaf ears, and Luffy runs off to get Chopper so Pekoms can feel better sooner, causing the mink to fall off his bed once again.
Luffy runs out to the porch, where he sees Zoro sitting on a bench. He asks if Zoro heard the conversation, and Zoro replies that he just barely did. Luffy grins, wondering if Zoro is concerned about Sanji, causing Zoro to get mad. Chopper, Milky, Usopp, Robin, and Brook then come to the building, and Luffy tells Chopper that Pekoms is screaming and hitting his head against the wall, causing Chopper to rush inside to treat him. Brook is then attacked by several dog Guardians who chew on him, and Nekomamushi then approaches despite Chopper's order to get rest, greeting Luffy and leaping into him and Zoro, which destroys part of the porch. Nekomamushi becomes dazed and his wounds reopen, and as the Straw Hats wonder what to do with him, Law and the Heart Pirates then approach Luffy. The 20 members of the Heart Pirates happily greet Luffy, but Law pulls him aside to talk, disappointing his crewmates.
Luffy and Law go inside, where Luffy reveals Sanji's situation and his intention to enter Big Mom's territory, and he asks Law to hold off on their mission against Kaidou. However, Law replies that they likely do not have that option, as Kaidou is increasingly likely to attack them, especially since he knows how to get to Zou. Law wonders what will happen to this country if it is attacked by the Beasts Pirates again, and the Guardians suddenly appear, crying tears of happiness in appreciation for Law's concern for them. They throw a party for the two pirate crews, and everyone feasts as Nekomamushi unveils the main dish, lasagna. As the party rages on, Luffy wonders if he has forgotten something, but cannot remember anything and continues partying. Meanwhile, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete ride a creature up Zunesha's leg, and as the pirates and Guardians fall asleep after the party, Robin, Franky, and Brook sit down at the entrance to the Mokomo Dukedom. They are intent on preventing Kin'emon and Kanjuro from getting in, as they believe that the minks will not take kindly to allies of Raizo, who caused Jack to destroy the country. Robin suggests taking turns through the night, but Franky and Brook decide against it, and they all keep watch together. However, the next morning, they are all sound asleep as Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Bariete reach Zunesha's back on a rotund tiger named Torasaburo. The samurai celebrate as Kanjuro turns Torasaburo back into a drawing again. They then turn to Bariete to ask him for information, revealing they are comrades of Raizo. This causes Bariete to panic and run from them in tears, intent on alerting the other minks to the presence of samurai.","Pekoms, Nami, Monkey D.

Momonosuke reunites with Kin'emon and Kanjuro, and the three approach the minks in Kurau City.
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi see each other, and quickly start trading insults as they argue. During their exchange, Inuarashi remembers his leg being severed and Nekomamushi remembers his arm being severed by the Beasts Pirates during their torture. As the Straw Hats catch up to the samurai and hide them from the minks, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi pull out their weapons and clash with each other. The samurai then break the Straw Hats' hold on them to stop the fight, and when Kin'emon reveals his identity as a retainer of the Kouzuki Family, the minks reveal that Raizo is safe. This shocks the Straw Hats, and Nekomamushi reveals that they are close to the Kouzuki Family and would all risk their lives to save them.","As day breaks over Zou, Robin, Franky, and Brook wake up and they realize that they slept through the night. They then see the drawing of Torasaburo right next to Ryunosuke, and realize that Kin'emon and Kanjuro have gotten onto the island. The trio know that the minks are not going to take well to the samurai mentioning their comrade Raizo, as Jack and the Beasts Pirates destroyed the Mokomo Dukedom while looking for the nonexistent Raizo, and so they race to stop the samurai. Meanwhile, Bariete races up the steps to a bell, and he rings the bell as he calls out the samurai's arrival. Inside the Rightflank Fortress, a crocodile-boar steed is prepared for Inuarashi, who mounts it and tells Shishilian to round up everyone else and follow him as he rides toward Kurau City. Shishilian tells Inuarashi's subjects to do as they were told, but the subjects were told nothing, and he orders them to come with him and follow Duke Inuarashi. Meanwhile, Nekomamushi and the Guardians run out to Kurau City, with Nekomamushi stating that this is a serious incident and telling everyone to not fall behind.
The Guardians run around the sleeping Straw Hat Pirates, and as Nami wakes up she overhears one of them reveal that two samurai have appeared. A shocked Nami tries to wake Luffy up, but struggles to do so. Meanwhile, Kin'emon and Kanjuro walk through the forest and hear the bell, and they wonder if it is welcoming them. Suddenly, they hear a rustling in the bushes, and Momonosuke emerges, happily reuniting with his father and Kanjuro. He reveals that no one was around when he woke up, and so he went looking for people. Nearby, the Straw Hats run through the woods, and a half-asleep Luffy wonders why they are running right now. Nami reveals that the samurai have entered Zou, and Luffy gets excited at the prospect of another party to welcome them, but Nami states that the minks have a score to settle due to the samurai's comrade causing the Mokomo Dukedom's destruction. The Musketeers and Guardians race into Kurau City, and Pedro leaps up a tall building in order to see the entire city. However, he sees Inuarashi walking nearby and tries to warn Nekomamushi, but the ruler cannot hear him. Inuarashi appears at the intersection directly behind Nekomamushi, and one of the Guardians sees him in shock, but they try their best to prevent the two rulers from seeing each other. However, when Shishilian enters the intersection, he sees Nekomamushi and gasps, causing the two rulers to turn around and see each other.
The two rulers approach each other despite their underlings trying to stop them, and a short distance away stand the samurai, who have reached Kurau City and wonder what is going on. The Straw Hats then reach the city and tackle the samurai, hiding them behind a piece of rubble. They tell the samurai to go back to the Thousand Sunny, as the samurai's presence would just add fuel to the fire. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi immediately start insulting each other, bringing attention to each other's missing limbs. Inuarashi remembers Jack torturing him for Raizo's whereabouts, but the dog mink had continued denying any knowledge of the ninja, causing Jack to cut at and eventually sever his lower left leg. Around that time, some of the Beasts Pirates tried to get information out of Nekomamushi by threatening his fallen comrades, but Nekomamushi called them cowards and pulled on the chains binding him to the crucifix, challenging the shocked pirates to give him all their attacks. Back in the present, the two rulers state that they would have been fine with each other's death, and decide to fight to the death right now despite their underlings' pleas.
As Inuarashi's sword clashes with Nekomamushi's spear, Kin'emon suddenly breaks Usopp's grasp on him and heads out into the open in order to stop the fighting. Momonosuke and Kanjuro then emerge despite the Straw Hats grabbing onto them, and the minks are surprised to see the samurai as they approach the trio. Kin'emon then introduces himself as a retainer of the Kouzuki Family from Wano Country and reveals that he is looking for his comrade Raizo. The Straw Hats cry in fear and wonder if they need to fight to get out of this, but all of the minks suddenly sit down. In tears, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reveal that Raizo is safe. The Straw Hats are bewildered by this, and Usopp confronts the minks in disbelief about them risking all their lives to protect Raizo. However, Nekomamushi reveals that they have been friends with the Kouzuki Family for a long time, and would do anything to keep their allies safe even if it meant the destruction of their civilization; this revelation moves the Straw Hats to tears.","Franky, Nico Robin, Brook, Ryunosuke (image), Torasaburo (image), Bariete, Wany, Inuarashi, Shishilian, Wanda, Carrot, Nekomamushi, Pedro, Roddy, Blackback, Monkey D.

Inside the damaged but still functional Mammoth, a recovering Jack sits belowdeck and reads the newspaper article about his supposed death. Mocking such a thought, Jack shreds the newspaper and orders his men to make the ship move faster.
In order to verify his claim of being a retainer of the Kouzuki Family, Kin'emon removes his kimono, revealing the crest of the family on his back. Behind him, the Straw Hats ponder in shock about this sudden turn of events, but understand why the samurai kept their allegiance a secret from them. Nekomamushi interrupts Inuarashi as the latter talks to the samurai, causing Inuarashi to shout at him and the two to trade insults once again. However, as they start fighting and prepare to physically clash again, Momonosuke shouts at them to stop, expressing disappointment at the two's enmity and saying it would make his father sad. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi then bow down to Momonosuke, and the Straw Hats are confused, as they thought Kin'emon was Momonosuke's father and just heard Kin'emon refer to Momonosuke with the suffix -sama. Kin'emon reveals that Momonosuke is actually not his son, and instead is Kouzuki Momonosuke, the son and heir of the daimyo of Kuri, Kouzuki Oden. Kin'emon apologizes for lying to the Straw Hats, as he and Momonosuke had pretended to be father and son in order to protect themselves. The Straw Hats' bewilderment just keeps growing, and Momonosuke approaches the Straw Hats to apologize to them himself. However, Luffy does not care about Momonosuke's heritage, causing the two of them to get into a fight. Momonosuke demonstrates his perverted nature afterwards, but everyone is happy. In order to keep Momonosuke happy, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reluctantly decide to make a truce, and they clasp hands. This causes the minks to rejoice at Zou becoming reunited, at least for now.
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi then take the Straw Hats, Law, and the samurai to see Raizo. They travel up a path on the Whale Tree, and Luffy, Chopper, Usopp, and Franky are excited at the chance to see a real ninja. Momonosuke tells Kin'emon that he is still not feeling well, saying that he hears a voice calling out to him from within; Kin'emon replies that Oden had the same ability. As the male Straw Hats grow more excited to see Raizo and imagine him as a stereotypical ninja, they reach a hidden entrance in the back of the Whale Tree. The Straw Hats run down to see the ninja, and they hear Raizo cry out from inside. As Inuarashi and Nekomamushi come down to the cave, a tearful Raizo asks what happened, as he noticed that the minks giving him food were all injured. The Straw Hats then arrive and see Raizo chained to a red poneglyph; they are shocked that he is very stocky and does not anywhere closely resemble the ninja they had imagined.","Jack, Zunesha, Inuarashi, Kin'emon, Kouzuki Momonosuke, Kanjuro, Nekomamushi, Carrot, Wanda, Monjii, Pedro, Blackback, Shishilian, Concelot, Giovanni, Monkey D.

Episode 769,A Red Stone! A Guide to the ‘One Piece’,18-Dec-16,"Raizo is released from his chains, and many of the male Straw Hats beg him to use ninja techniques and act like a stereotypical ninja. He refuses at first, but obliges after seeing their disappointment, and performs an array of ninja arts. The samurai and the male Straw Hats then take Raizo outside, where he weeps at the sight of the destroyed Kurau City.
Robin translates the red Poneglyph inside the Whale Tree, which reveals the coordinates of an island close to Laugh Tale. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reveal that this is a Road Poneglyph, one out of four that exists. If one is able to find all four, they will discover four islands surrounding Laugh Tale, and by connecting the four islands, they can find Laugh Tale in the center and find the One Piece.","Nekomamushi apologizes to Raizo for lying to him and trapping him here for his protection, and Raizo then sees Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Momonosuke coming down the stairs. The four Wano Country natives happily reunite, and Raizo is released from his chains by his comrades. Robin, Nami, and Brook then reach the bottom of the stairs, and they look in awe at the Kouzuki Family crest on the wall and the giant red poneglyph in the center. Robin asks Inuarashi and Nekomamushi for permission to read it, which they grant her. Robin recalls studying the poneglyphs on Ohara before its destruction, and notes that this poneglyph's red color is much different from every other poneglyph she has read, which were all blue. Inuarashi replies that this poneglyph has a different purpose.
Meanwhile, Raizo is perturbed by Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper for staring at him intently, and the three Straw Hats tell him to perform various ninja arts and act like a stereotypical ninja. Raizo is confused as to why they want to see that, and Franky replies that all men love ninjas. Raizo is smitten by this praise, and Franky, Zoro, and Law join in on asking him to perform ninja arts, but he plainly tells them that ninja do not act like the pirates have imagined and they do not perform their skills for show. This causes the Straw Hats to sulk in disappointment, and Raizo is eventually moved, causing him to use Enton no Jutsu and disappear before reappearing behind Usopp. Raizo then uses Bunshin no Jutsu to make clones of himself, and Kawarimi no Jutsu to escape from Luffy's grasp. He runs on the ceiling and uses his Hana Shuriken to form the kanji for shinobi on the wall, and he concludes his performance, causing the male Straw Hats to be in glee and awe. Afterwards, the male Straw Hats and the samurai take Raizo outside, where they see the destroyed Kurau City from atop the Whale Tree. Raizo and the samurai burst into tears for the destroyed city, with Raizo remembering it as a bustling town before the attack. Raizo curses the minks for taking rash actions to protect him, and vows to avenge them as best he can.
Nekomamushi then appears and calls the pirates and samurai back in, revealing that the red poneglyph has been translated. Inside the Whale Tree, Nami notes that the text Robin translated is nautical coordinates that she can pinpoint the location of on a chart. Inuarashi reveals that this is a Road Poneglyph, which will guide people to the end of the Grand Line. The Whale Forest is considered sacred and is heavily protected for this very reason. The Straw Hats assume that this means the Road Poneglyph leads them to Laugh Tale, but Inuarashi corrects them, saying that there are actually four Road Poneglyphs. Each of them reveal the coordinates of an island, and when all four of these islands are found, one can connect them and finally locate Laugh Tale and find the One Piece. The Straw Hats become extremely excited to hear about something relating to their final goal.","Raizo, Nekomamushi, Franky, Monkey D. Luffy, Tony Tony Chopper, Usopp, Roronoa Zoro, Trafalgar D.

Episode 770,The Secret of Wano Country - The Kouzuki Family and the Poneglyphs,25-Dec-16,"After learning that he and his crew can reach Laugh Tale by finding four Road Poneglyphs, Luffy gets excited, although he learns that two of the Road Poneglyphs are in the possession of the Emperors Big Mom and Kaidou, which frightens some of the Straw Hats. However, Robin is the only person alive who can read the Poneglyphs.
Meanwhile, Jack has a dream about his attack on Doflamingo's Marine escort the week prior. However, it is cut off by the arrival of Sheepshead, Ginrummy, and the other crew members he left on Zou.
Back in the Whale Tree, the Straw Hats learn that the Kouzuki Family were the ones who constructed the Poneglyphs hundreds of years ago. However, the knowledge of how to read them stopped at Momonosuke's father Oden, and Kin'emon tearfully reveals that Oden was executed by Kaidou and the shogun of Wano Country. The Beasts Pirates now occupy Wano Country, and had gone after Oden and his retainers because Oden had been on Laugh Tale with Gol D. Roger and had witnessed the secret of the world.","Luffy and the Straw Hats get excited upon discovering that they can reach Laugh Tale and the One Piece with the Road Poneglyphs, and Luffy races off to rescue Sanji and find the other Road Poneglyphs. His crewmates stop him, but Nekomamushi states that Luffy's plan will lead him to them, because two of the Road Poneglyphs are in the possession of the Emperors Big Mom and Kaidou. The Straw Hats are appalled to hear this, though Luffy takes it in stride, as he planned on beating the Emperors anyway. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reveal that the Poneglyphs' messages can be copied with ink on a special paper, and Usopp proposes that they sneak into Big Mom and Kaidou's territories, copy the text, run away, and reach Laugh Tale without anyone realizing it. However, Luffy rejects his idea due to it being cowardly, and Usopp is frightened by the amount of power they are going against. Meanwhile, Nekomamushi voices his concern for Robin, as she is the only one who can read the text on the Poneglyphs, making her a target for others who want to find out the true history of the Void Century. However, Robin is confident that her crewmates will protect her as she remembers them rescuing her on Enies Lobby, and the other Straw Hats pledge their continued resolve to protect her.
Meanwhile, Jack dreams about ordering his men to attack the four Marine battleships transporting Doflamingo a week ago. Sengoku, Fujitora, and Tsuru braced themselves for battle, and Doflamingo smiled as the Marines raced to their battle stations. The Marines and the Beasts Pirates opened fire on each other, but the Mammoth managed to evade the fire as it charged at the ship with Sengoku, Fujitora, and Tsuru on it, and Fujitora unsheathed his sword as he prepared to unleash his power on Jack's ship. However, Jack is woken from his dream by his crewmates, who reveal that Sheepshead, Ginrummy, and the men he left on Zou have returned.
Back in the Whale Tree, Robin asks the minks and the samurai how they know so much about the Poneglyphs. The minks and samurai look to Momonosuke for an approval, and their master states that they do not have to hide anything from the Straw Hats. Luffy gets mad at Momonosuke for acting like he is in charge, even though he is. Nekomamushi then reveals that 800 years ago, the members of the Kouzuki Family invented the Poneglyphs, which shocks the Straw Hats. The knowledge of how to construct them was not passed down, only how to read and write the inscriptions. However, that was not passed down to Momonosuke from his father Oden, and the samurai struggle to reveal the reason why, though many of the Straw Hats figure it out. As he and his fellow retainers struggle to hold back tears, Kin'emon reveals that Oden was executed by Kaidou and the shogun of Wano Country. The Beasts Pirates now occupy Wano Country, and when the Straw Hats inquire as to why they killed Oden and have continuously pursued Momonosuke and the samurai, Kin'emon reveals that Oden once traveled with Gol D. Roger, reaching Laugh Tale and learning the secret of the world.","Nico Robin, Nekomamushi, Monkey D. Luffy, Nami, Usopp, Brook, Roronoa Zoro, Inuarashi, Tony Tony Chopper, Franky, Trafalgar D.

Kin'emon and his retainers want to fight back. They ask their allies for help, and they accept. However, Luffy declines for Momonosuke's sake of being the supposed leader of Wano. After Momonosuke pleads for Luffy's help to defeat Kaidou, he then accepts. The Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance is formed to defeat Kaidou together.","As everybody reacts to learning that Momonosuke's father Oden, who was executed, travelled to Laugh Tale on Gol D. Roger's ship, Robin realizes that Oden must have known about the Void Century, which the archeologists of Ohara spent their lives studying. Zoro believes that this is the reason that Kin'emon's group of samurai were targeted by Doflamingo and Caesar, who have ties with Kaidou, even though Oden kept all the information to himself for the safety of his people.
Kin’emon, as well as all the other retainers, say they plan on fighting back because of Oden’s last words, which were, ""Open up Wano Country!"" The reason the samurai came to Zou is to ask their allies, the Minks, to help them fight and the rest of the samurai, excluding Momonosuke, ask Law and Luffy for their help. The rest of the Straw Hats accept the offer without any hesitation, but Luffy declines the request. As the group try to knock some sense into their captain, Luffy calls out the crying Momonosuke and says he should be requesting their aid if he is the supposed leader of Wano Country. Momonosuke steps up and pleads for Luffy’s help to take down Kaidou, as he is too small right now but still wants to protect all of his retainers.

Meanwhile, Jack has punished Sheepshead for returning to him without Raizo, and his fleet returns to Zou to attack it again. However, rather than take on the minks in battle again, Jack decides to attack the elephant Zunesha itself, shocking his crew.
Back on Zou, the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai alliance heads back outside, and Inuarashi and Nekomamushi regale the Straw Hats with tales about their and Oden's travels with Whitebeard and later Roger. However, they did not reach Laugh Tale with Roger, and Kin'emon states that Oden leaving Wano Country to go sailing was a crime. Nami then asks about Crocus' words on the Log Pose, as he stated that it would guide them to the final destination Laugh Tale. However, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reply that rather than leading them directly to Laugh Tale, it will lead them to a place that will be integral to helping them reach Laugh Tale beyond the end. As the alliance resumes talking about their plans to fight Kaidou, Nekomamushi states his intention to find Marco and the remaining Whitebeard Pirates as allies for the war.","Luffy expresses his excitement for the upcoming battle with Kaidou, and the members of the newly formed Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance once again celebrate their formation. However, Luffy then brings forth a condition to their alliance, as he requests that he go rescue Sanji from Big Mom before the final war. Nekomamushi remembers Sanji, but Inuarashi does not due to having been in a coma at the time, and Nekomamushi explains to him who Sanji was and how he left Zou. Luffy is warned about the danger of the mission, but he is confident since he does not plan to fight Big Mom and will be accompanied by Pekoms, whom he calls ""Pekomamushi"", which causes Nekomamushi to laugh and Inuarashi to be confused. Meanwhile, the minks in Kurau City rejoice about the newfound peace between Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, looking forward to their schedules being less strict and planning to prepare a banquet.
Meanwhile, Jack's fleet sails the seas, and Jack sits next to Sheepshead, who is heavily injured and hanging upside down. Having punished him for returning to him without finding Raizo, Jack continues berating Sheepshead, and Ginrummy silently hopes Sheepshead does not say anything about why they left, as Jack would certainly not be happy to hear that not only were the minks still alive, but that his members were chased away by another pirate crew. The fleet then draws closer to Zou as the Beasts Pirates prepare to finish off the minks and complete their mission, but Jack states that they will not confront the minks again. Instead, they will attack Zunesha, the giant elephant carrying Zou itself, and his crew members are awed at the notion of attacking such a giant being.
Meanwhile, the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai alliance heads back outside, and Inuarashi mentions how he and Nekomamushi once sailed with the Roger Pirates. Luffy is awed to hear this, and Inuarashi clarifies, saying they accompanied Oden as his attendants and previously sailed with the Whitebeard Pirates as well. The Straw Hats are amazed to hear about the rulers' histories, and Usopp hurriedly writes their accounts in his notebook. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi gleefully remember the times of adventure they had, to the point of dancing together, which Usopp notes is quite the contrast to when they were trying to kill each other a very short time ago. However, Nekomamushi reveals that he and Inuarashi did not go to Laugh Tale, and Kin'emon states that he, Kanjuro, and Raizo did not accompany Oden due to it being a crime to go beyond Wano Country's borders. Momonosuke states that he was too young to remember much about his father's journey, but the Straw Hats immediately call him out due to Roger's voyage being over two decades ago. Franky then asks Inuarashi and Nekomamushi if they remember Tom, and the two rulers do and are happy to hear of him.
As Brook is about to ask the rulers if they remember Crocus, Nami interjects and asks about the Log Pose, recalling how Crocus told them it would lead to their final destination on the Grand Line and wondering how it reconciles with their new discovery about how the Road Poneglyphs are needed to reach Laugh Tale. However, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reply that Crocus' statement is indeed accurate, as the Straw Hats will need to bring all the information they have gathered on Laugh Tale and the True History to the final island, which will cause the final island to have an integral role in allowing them to go beyond it and find Laugh Tale. Nekomamushi fondly recalls Crocus and how he was going to look for a pirate crew from long ago; Brook then reveals that he is from that crew and that the rest of his crewmates died, which shocks Nekomamushi. The alliance then reaches the bottom of the Whale Tree, and as Luffy plans to go and get Sanji back, Nekomamushi states that he has allies to recruit as well for the battle against Kaidou: Marco and the remaining Whitebeard Pirates.","Wanda, Carrot, Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, Pedro, Blackback, Monkey D.

As the Musketeers and Guardians race off to deal with the enemy pirates, Zunesha receives a crippling blow and tells Momonosuke that it was once punished to walk the seas for eternity. Thus, it could not act against Jack unless given the order, and asks Momonosuke to do so. Momonosuke orders Zunesha to attack Jack, allowing the giant elephant to annihilate Jack's entire fleet with a single swing of its trunk.
As the people on Zou recover from the attack, Scratchmen Apoo contacts Kaidou to report the loss of Jack's fleet.","Zou continues to shake from the cannon fire of the Beasts Pirates' fleet hitting Zunesha's leg, and the people on Zou struggle to stand; as this happens, Luffy and Momonosuke writhe in pain due to having an overpowering noise inside their heads. The buildings in the Guardians Residential District begin collapsing, and one falls on Tristan, but Franky catches it and saves her. Wanda tells everyone to congregate together and get away from the buildings, but several trees are uprooted and fall on them. However, Zoro cuts apart the falling trees, and Raizo throws shuriken on the ground to prevent the wood slices from bouncing onto the minks. Momonosuke collapses due to the pain inside his head, and as Kin'emon and Kanjuro tend to him, he receives a vision where he sees Jack and his fleet attacking Zunesha. Momonosuke then reveals the cause of Zou quaking, and the Musketeers and Guardians race to their ships to take on Jack in a naval battle, determined to win this time.
Zunesha then talks directly to Momonosuke, warning him that if Jack's forces brought it down, everyone on Zou would be in grave danger. It reveals that it was condemned to walk across the ocean for eternity, and could only act otherwise if it was ordered to. The Beasts Pirates' cannon fire then manages to severely weaken Zunesha's front left leg, causing it to tilt even more and force the people on Zou to hang on for dear life. The Beasts Pirates celebrate their success, and Jack anticipates finishing Zunesha off. Zunesha begs Momonosuke to give it the order to attack Jack and protect everyone on Zou, and after struggling to regain his composure, Momonosuke gives Zunesha the order, shouting it across the entire island on its back. Zunesha's voice composure then changes and it steps forward with its front left foot, perturbing the Beasts Pirates as it understands the order. Zunesha then swings its trunk across the ocean, causing a massive wave that sends Jack's fleet flying into the air. Finally, it swings its trunk right into the fleet, completely annihilating it and breaking Jack's mask as it blows him and his crewmates into the ocean along with the large wreckage of their ships. Zunesha then resumes its walk.
Bariete witnesses the scene while hanging off a chain going down Zunesha's left flank, and hurriedly races off in shock to report what happened. Zou stops shaking, and everyone on it wonders what has happened, with Momonosuke not hearing anything anymore. Bariete then comes to them and reveals that Jack's fleet has been destroyed by Zunesha, causing everyone to be joyful. Inuarashi is surprised that Zunesha has a mind of its own, and Usopp asks if Jack is dead since he is a Devil Fruit user that fell into water, which Nekomamushi affirms, causing Usopp to be greatly relieved.

The Straw Hats then organize an effort to treat Zunesha's injuries. However, Zunesha walks into a massive thundercloud called a Silent Supercell that threatens to blow away the ships and people hanging near the elephant's leg wound, but the Straw Hats manage to save the ships from falling. Afterwards, Luffy packs for his voyage to Big Mom's territory while Nami maps out a way to get there, and Pedro, Wanda, and Carrot individually decide to accompany Luffy on the voyage.","A flying squirrel mink named Musatobi glides down to Zunesha's front left leg and examines it. When he sees the extent of the leg's damage, he becomes shocked and quickly flies back up to warn the others. On Zou, Nekomamushi agrees to give Luffy food for his journey, and Musatobi races to the crowd to warn them about Zunesha's injuries. Zunesha's injured leg then gives out slightly, causing Zou to shake again. The minks prepare to take imminent action, and Luffy offers his crew's help in treating Zunesha. Inuarashi states that the crew is not obligated to help them, but Luffy insists, saying that they are in an alliance. Chopper prepares to get medicinal herbs, and Usopp asks if the minks have bandages for the elephant, which they deny, so he and Robin decide to work on that. Franky then asks about the ships the minks had mentioned during Jack's attack, wondering how they can embark from the island.
He, Usopp, and Shishilian go to the building that houses the ships, only to find that all of them were destroyed during Jack's attack. However, the pulley systems that are used to bring the ships down to the ocean are still intact, and Franky decides to rebuild the ships. Shishilian then tells all the minks outside to assist the Straw Hats in this endeavor and Franky calls on Zoro, Brook, and Kin'emon to help them cut down trees for wood. Meanwhile, Wanda thanks the Straw Hats for helping the minks, and Nami asks if she could get a map in order to chart a route to Big Mom's territory. Wanda does not have one, but Pedro does, and he prepares to take Nami to it. In another area, Chopper and several minks pick medicinal herbs, and Chopper explains to Miyagi and Tristan that this is a rare herb which can heal Zunesha's injuries. As Luffy and Carrot ride a crocodile-boar steed across the island, they come across several female minks holding large white sheets, which Robin sews together with her Devil Fruit powers in order to create a giant bandage. Back in the forest, Brook uses his swordsmanship to cut down several trees, and so does Kin'emon, although his Foxfire Style causes the trees to catch on fire, and Raizo puts out the fire quickly with a watering can. Zoro then cuts up several trees into fine lumber, but ends up separating himself from everyone else, which Law berates him for. And then, Luffy and Carrot come by and make fun of Zoro, causing him to be embarrassed even further and declare that he will carry all the lumber himself, but Law uses Shambles to transport Zoro (against his will) directly to the construction site on the edge of Zou, which Carrot reacts in shock.
Meanwhile, Nami receives a map inside a room, and plots out the direction to go in to get to Whole Cake Island, which will take more than a week. Wanda and Pedro then decide individually and silently to accompany the Straw Hats in the quest to Whole Cake Island in order to provide assistance, and Luffy and Carrot drop in as Nami notices a small island on their route near the edge of their map. She then looks outside, and sees to her shock that there is a giant cloud formation in the sea nearby. At the edge of Zou, Franky receives the freshly cut lumber, and quickly builds pristine boats which the minks gawk at. Chopper and his helpers then arrive with the medicine, and other minks come with bandages, saying that Robin stayed behind to make more so they could change them later. Usopp and Kanjuro then come up on a poorly drawn parrot, having laid the tracks to bring down the ships on. Back in the map room, Nami states that the cloud formation she sees is a Silent Supercell, a powerful stormcloud which is likely to wreak havoc on the treatment effort. She tells a shocked Luffy to warn the others to stop the treatment and evacuate.
Meanwhile, the boats are lowered with the pulley systems, allowing the Straw Hats and minks to get close to Zunesha's wounds. Chopper spreads the medicinal herb onto the wound, stating that it must be painful, but Zunesha is quietly taking it. Tristan assists Chopper, and silently wishes that she could learn medical practice from him. After Chopper finishes applying the medicine, he orders the bandage to be applied. However, Zunesha enters the Silent Supercell, and as Luffy and Carrot race to the edge of Zou, the Straw Hats and minks begin feeling strong winds. The wind strength increases as a downpour begins, and Carrot and Luffy are blown toward their destination. The wind causes the hanging ships to swing toward Zunesha's leg, but Usopp cushions the impact with a Pop Green. A rope holding one of the boats snaps, causing the people on it to fall, but Luffy stretches out his arm, allowing them to grab onto it and slide onto another boat. The brace holding all the boats then snaps, but Luffy manages to grab it, allowing him to hold the boats in place until the storm passes. Robin then uses her Devil Fruit powers to securely hold the pulley system in place, and the cheerful minks return to work.
Later, Carrot takes Luffy to a pantry, where he places a lot of food into a big backpack. Carrot gushes over the talents of Luffy's crew, and tries to ask if she can go on the mission to Whole Cake Island, but Luffy does not hear her as he suddenly realizes that he forgot about Pekoms, who he needs on his journey. Luffy then asks Carrot to take the backpack to the Thousand Sunny before running out, and Carrot eyes some bananas on the floor. At the edge of Zou, the Straw Hats and minks begin finishing up Zunesha's treatment, and the minks thank the Straw Hats for all their help, with Shishilian giving an especially over the top presentment of gratitude. Meanwhile, Carrot goes to the top of the Mokomo Dukedom gates, and gazes out at the ocean in awe before giving some bananas to Bariete. Elsewhere, Luffy runs through the forest to look for Pekoms.","Zunesha, Musatobi, Nekomamushi, Inuarashi, Kanjuro, Carrot, Monkey D.

Episode 777,To the Levely - Princess Vivi and Princess Shirahoshi,19-Feb-17,"Rulers all across the world head for the quadrennial Levely, and Vivi gets in touch with her pirating past while at sea as she remembers her experiences with the Straw Hat Pirates. Sterry, now king of the Goa Kingdom, stays in a hotel in Loguetown with his wife Sarie Nantokanette. The ruler of Kano Country prepares to head off, even without the Chinjao Family to accompany him. On Fish-Man Island, a frightened Shirahoshi is convinced by her brothers and father to come to Levely, as they now had enough signatures on Otohime's petition for fish-men to coexist with humans.
On the Thousand Sunny, the Sanji retrieval team recovers from their unexpected jump off of Zou. As they struggle to keep on course, Carrot unexpectedly shows up to help, shocking all of them.","The citizens of Arabasta wave goodbye to Princess Vivi as she sails away from Arabasta with Cobra, Karoo, and their attendants. They are escorted by a Marine ship captained by Rear Admiral Hina, and she orders Jango, Fullbody, and the rest of her men to stay vigilant in their escort. Vivi climbs up to the Crow's Nest and waves goodbye to her subjects as she looks out at the open sea in front of her. Toto remarks that Vivi looks extremely comfortable out in the sea, and Koza replies that she is getting in touch with her pirating past again. As she stands in the Crow's Nest, Vivi remembers her experiences with the Straw Hat Pirates. Two years ago on Arabasta, she and Luffy had argued on whether it was better to save the country by beating up Crocodile or stopping the oncoming civil war, causing them to fight. However, Luffy's remark that he and his crew would help Vivi save her country deeply affected her. Later, Vivi was captured and held over the edge of a tall building by Crocodile, and as he dropped her, Luffy flew in on Pell and caught her before battling Crocodile. Eventually, Luffy managed to defeat Crocodile, and as she saw the defeated Crocodile fly up into the air, Vivi gained enough willpower to shout for an end to the fighting going on in front of her, and the fighters began hearing her call for peace as rain fell in Alubarna for the first time in a long time. Days later, the Straw Hats began sailing away from Arabasta, and Vivi went to say goodbye to them, revealing that she intended to stay in order to fulfill her responsibility towards her people. The Straw Hats tried saying goodbye, but Nami pointed out that the Marines chasing them would likely see the exchange and label Vivi as a criminal for being affiliated with them. The Straw Hats then raised up their left arms, which bore X marks that they and Vivi made earlier as marks of their friendship, silently saying their farewells as they swore their continued bond with the princess of Arabasta.
Back in the present, Igaram tells Vivi to come down to the deck, worrying about the various ways she could be harmed up there. However, Vivi only scares him more by somersaulting off the Crow's Nest, landing gently on her feet. She then talks to Cobra, who is coughing, and she expresses concern about his ability to make the voyage to Levely. Cobra states his intention to go, as he wanted to ask the World Government about the Poneglyph on Arabasta, and why their ancestors' actions were inscribed on it. However, he does state that he could die soon, and wonders if Vivi will choose a husband soon to help her rule the kingdom. However, Vivi politely declines her father's statement with a wink.
Sterry, now king of the Goa Kingdom, stays in a fancy hotel room with his wife, Sarie Nantokanette, on their way to Levely. Nantokanette admires their room, but Sterry finds little to compliment on, only noting that he could see Gol D. Roger's execution scaffold from the window and that he had seen worse places. His attendants ask if he needs anything, and Sterry rudely drives them away, causing them to run out of the room. It is then revealed that the time has now come for the Levely, and rulers of countries all over the world are making the voyage to Mary Geoise in order to meet with each other. In Kano Country, its ruler laments the absence of the Chinjao Family, but prepares to make the journey anyways. He states that the war ended after the other side lost access to the weapons supplied by Doflamingo, and he has lots to talk about at Levely. Meanwhile, on Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi curls up into a ball in apprehension at going up to Mary Geoise, saying that Luffy promised he would be the one to take her farther into the outside world. Her brothers and attendants try convincing her otherwise, saying that their journey is simple and straight up and that Luffy will take her farther than that; also, they now have enough signatures on Otohime's petition for human and fish-man coexistence to present at Levely. However, Shirahoshi still resists, and her brothers wonder if they should leave her behind, but Neptune states that it would not make them look trusting should they withhold her. Shirahoshi then remembers her time with Luffy, and how she had resolved to stop crying as much the next time she saw him.
On the Thousand Sunny, Luffy wonders why everyone else on the ship is not doing their jobs promptly as the other members of the Sanji retrieval team are still recovering from their jump off of Zou. Nami is sick to her stomach and can barely keep them on their intended path, and Carrot suddenly jumps in, offering to help. Luffy initially admires her for her energy, not realizing who she is at first. He and the rest of the crew then gasp in shock to see her, and Carrot excitedly looks out at the vast expanses of the ocean as everyone else wonders why she is here.","Nefertari Vivi, Toto, Koza, Hina, Jango, Fullbody, Igaram, Karoo, Sanji (flashback), Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 780,A Hungry Front - Luffy and the Marine Rookies!,19-Mar-17,"On the way to Whole Cake Island, the Sanji Retrieval Team becomes famished after running out of food. They come across Fron Island, where they stop to look for food, but they quickly find it is home to a Marine base.
On the Marine base, a hotshot Marine Captain named Grount arrives for his new assignment, quickly exasperating his comrades and his commander, Vice Admiral Prodi. Grount then runs into Bonham and Zappa, who used to serve with him under Admiral Aokiji. Luffy, Nami, Chopper, and Carrot don Marine outfits and sneak into the cafeteria to eat. However, they are quickly recognized after an altercation, and Grount excitedly prepares to fight Luffy.","After Luffy wasted all their food supplies, the Sanji Retrieval Team is quickly left starving, with Luffy famished to the point of even trying to eat Chopper. Pedro then sees an island from afar, and Nami realizes that it must be the island she spotted on the map in Zou. The team prepares to look for food there, but Pekoms reveals that the island, Fron Island, is home to a Marine base that keeps an eye on Big Mom and is full of hotshots. The team heads for the island's shore in the Shark Submerge III, with Pedro and Pekoms staying behind to guard the Thousand Sunny. On Fron Island, Vice Admiral Prodi and his men watch as a Marine ship carrying reserve forces draws closer to the island. However, an explosion suddenly hits the ship as the soldiers on it target one of their own. The target, Grount, has started attacking everyone, overpowering them with his speed and strength. To finish the rest of his comrades off, Grount activates the metallic attachment on his arm, which causes steam to exude from it and allows him to knock everyone out with extreme speed and power. Grount then jumps close to Prodi and tells him to send back the defeated forces due to them being too weak, which angers Prodi.
Meanwhile, Brook frightens a group of Marines into unconsciousness with his detached soul, and Luffy, Nami, Chopper, and Carrot put on the Marines' uniforms, though Luffy is hesitant. Brook then heads back to the Submerge, and Nami and Chopper look around the island, seeing the Marine ship that just arrived and also finding the building where the Marines store their food. In the Marine base, Prodi angrily contacts Garp, blaming him for sending Grount to the base, but Garp revealed that Grount requested it himself. After the call ends, Koby wonders to Garp why Grount requested to be stationed in such a remote area. Prodi then berates Grount for his reckless actions, asking the 17-year-old Captain why he asked to be transferred, and Grount stated his intention to take down Big Mom. Prodi is dismissive of Grount's high goals, calling him naive and noting that he served under Aokiji, belittling the former Admiral for deserting the Marines. Grount gets angry at Prodi for mocking Aokiji, having to be held back by Prodi's attendants. Prodi then tells his attendants to let Grount rest a while before he puts him on duty.
Outside, the Sanji Retrieval Team prepares to sneak into the Marines' food storage, but Luffy and Carrot end up going on ahead to the main base, where they come to the cafeteria. Grount then comes to the cafeteria as well, with his actions on the ship causing him to be ostracized by his comrades. Grount's attitude gets both sides riled up for a fight, but Bonham then steps in. Initially seeming like he would attack Grount, Bonam instead hugged his comrade, having previously served under Aokiji with him. He then pointed Grount to their other old comrade Zappa, who is hunched back and crying into his food due to having been rejected by every girl on the island. As this happens, Luffy and Carrot get excited when they see the food being served to them. Meanwhile, some other Marines find the Marines that the Sanji Retrieval Team knocked out and stripped, and report the scene immediately. Prodi receives the report and immediately tells his men to find the attackers' invasion route, activating every Video Den Den Mushi on the island before racing to the monitor room.
In the cafeteria, Grount eats his spicy curry. Nami and Chopper then enter, and are appalled to see Luffy and Carrot out in the open. The kitchen lady then notices the two of them and states they do not look familiar, which scares Nami and Chopper, but she mistakes them for new Marines and happily gives them food. Carrot then sees the two of them and calls out their names loudly, shocking Nami. Zappa hears Nami's name and quickly recognizes her in bewilderment. He then approaches her lovestruck, saying he knows who she is and holding up her bounty poster. Zappa proposes to Nami and tries to kiss her, but ends up kissing the kitchen lady's spoon as Nami runs away into the hall. Chopper goes with Nami as she recovers from the shock of Zappa's advances, and as Zappa starts crying again, Luffy grabs an entire bowl of curry, causing the Marines to shout in bewilderment. In the monitor room, Prodi notices the altercation and quickly recognizes Luffy. He then activates an alarm across the island, telling his forces that Luffy and his crew are here and ordering them to be captured. Meanwhile, Nami and Chopper run out of the Marine base, intent on getting supplies from the food storage room before they leave. Brook hears the alarm and is himself confronted by several Marines. Inside the cafeteria, the Marines confront Luffy and Carrot as Grount excitedly prepares to take Luffy down himself.","Carrot, Nami, Monkey D.

Episode 781,The Implacable Three - A Big Chase After the Straw Hats!,26-Mar-17,"Luffy, Carrot, Nami, and Chopper are pursued by the Marines Grount, Bonham, and Zappa, who confront them in the food warehouse. The Marines are eventually overpowered, and the Sanji retrieval team races to the shore, only to be confronted by Vice Admiral Prodi.","As Luffy and Carrot are surrounded by Marines inside the cafeteria, Carrot wonders what they should do. However, Luffy decides to keep eating rather than pay any mind to the Marines, grabbing an entire bowl of curry and planning to leave. Grount mocks Luffy, calling him a nothing before confronting him. He pulls out two daggers and attacks Luffy, but Luffy counters him with the curry ladle. The two duel, and Luffy eventually manages to slam the bottom of the ladle into Grount's face, covering it in curry. Meanwhile, Nami and Chopper make it outside, and though they see the Marines mobilizing to confront Luffy, Nami is confident that Luffy can take care of them. She and Chopper then prepare to raid the food storage facility to get food for their journey. Back in the cafeteria, Bonham pushes the embarrassed Grount aside and attacks Luffy himself, using Qigong and Rokushiki to rapidly attack the pirate with powerful blows. Luffy grows tired of fighting and tries to run out of the room with Carrot, but Bonham blocks the exit and activates Tekkai. However, Luffy blows him away with Gear 2, and he and Carrot run off into the hall to look for more food.
In the hallway, Carrot is suddenly stopped by Zappa, who offers her carrots in order to woo her. Carrot is attracted to the carrots and nibbles on Zappa in gratitude, causing him to become lovestruck and fall over. However, Carrot immediately returns to Luffy, causing Zappa to confront Luffy in a fit of jealousy. Zappa swings his swords at Luffy, but the pirate manages to easily block them with Armament Haki-imbued arms before Carrot brings Zappa down with an Electro jab. Brook's detached soul then appears, and upon Luffy asking he reveals that Nami and Chopper are headed for the food storage facility. Luffy and Carrot then run with Brook's soul down the hall, and Grount and Bonham follow them along with Zappa, who has only been made more amorous by Carrot's blow. Several Marines rush in to stop the intruders, but Carrot knocks them all out with her agility. However, Luffy and Carrot run into a dead end, with Brook not realizing they could not pass through the wall like he could. Grount and Bonham then corner the three of them, but they argue on who gets to take them down, giving Luffy enough time to punch a hole in the wall and escape outside with Carrot and Brook.
Luffy follows the scent of food to the storage facility, and Nami and Chopper find him and Carrot inside and gorging on food. They try to get them to hurry up and leave, but Luffy has not had his fill yet. Grount, Bonham, and Zappa then reach the facility, and confront the Sanji retrieval team. Bonham and Zappa attack Luffy, but he dodges them and they fall to the ground from their momentum. Chopper then jumps in to fight Bonham, but is unable to penetrate the Marine's Tekkai. Bonham uses Qigong to make himself slimmer, and he overwhelms Chopper by using Soru. However, Chopper manages to guard against attacks with Guard Point, and Bonham tries to break through it by becoming bulky again and using Jusshigan. Chopper blocks it by transforming into Heavy Point, and sends Bonham flying into the food storage and defeating him despite the Marine using Tekkai. Meanwhile, Zappa confronts Luffy, Nami, and Carrot as they try to escape, intending to bring Luffy down so Nami and Carrot could be his. Carrot quickly dispatches him with an Electro shock, but Zappa once again fails to stay down, proposing marriage to both Nami and Carrot. However, Nami smugly says that he does not know what women want as she releases a weather egg, out of which a storm cloud hatches. Nami then strikes Zappa down with a giant thunderbolt, invigorating his amorousness to a great degree before finally knocking him out. However, Zappa recovers from even this, and lights his swords on fire as he unleashes a giant attack at Luffy. Luffy hits the flames back with Armament Haki, and they hit a giant pot of water, causing it to fall right on Zappa and flood the facility.
The Sanji retrieval team is washed out of the facility, holding on to giant bags of food. As they try to begin their escape, however, they are confronted by Grount. Grount and Luffy then start to brawl, and Luffy manages to overpower Grount physically despite Grount activating the steam-powered appendage on his arm. After a massive clash, Luffy finally blows Grount back to where the recently emerged Bonham and Zappa are. As Bonham and Zappa check on Grount, the Sanji retrieval team finally makes their escape. However, they are stopped at the coast by Vice Admiral Prodi and his men. Prodi gives a long spiel about how the Straw Hats are ruining innocent people's lives with their adventure, but then reveals that he is only confronting them in order to avoid being demoted, shocking his men. The Sanji retrieval team then prepares to fight Prodi.","Carrot, Monkey D. Luffy, Shimoi Zappa, All-Hunt Grount, Ant De Bonham, Nami, Tony Tony Chopper, Brook, Prodi",
Episode 782,The Devil's Fist - A Show Down! Luffy vs. Grount,2-Apr-17,"Luffy manages to defeat Prodi, Bonham, and Zappa in his quest to get off of Fron Island. However, he is confronted again by Grount, who shatters the attachment on his left arm to reveal a large, hairy red arm resembling a gorilla's. Having trained all his life to control it, Grount wields its tremendous power against Luffy, but after a titanic struggle Luffy eventually manages to overpower and defeat him. As the Sanji retrieval team finally leaves Fron Island, Grount laughs and remarks that Luffy was a worthy opponent. On the Thousand Sunny, the Sanji retrieval team eats all the rations taken from the base in ten minutes.","Prodi confronts the Sanji retrieval team at the coast of Fron Island, intent on defeating them in order to maintain his base's reputation of strength that they need to operate against Big Mom. Should he fail, he will likely be demoted and transferred to a new island, where he will be forced to retire without the pension amount he desires. The Sanji retrieval team is surprised at his intentions, but press on, knowing they can escape once they get to the Shark Submerge III. Brook waves to his crewmates from the nearby submarine, but Prodi points his bazooka at the Submerge and shoots at it, engulfing it and Brook in a large explosion. The Sanji retrieval team is shocked at this move, and Prodi confronts them, telling Luffy that he used to fight Garp evenly with his bazooka. Prodi then shoots his bazooka at the team, but they dodge the blast as they jump down to the beach where Prodi and his troops are. As the Marines try to attack them, Nami tries hitting them with Thunderbolt Tempo, but they emerge from the attack unscathed with the help of their shields. Carrot's Electro attacks are also ineffective, and the Marines reveal that their shields are covered in rubber. However, Nami simply uses Gust Sword to blow them away and overwhelms them with Mirage Tempo, Chopper easily overpowers them with Kung Fu Point, and Carrot kicks a Marine soldier without Electro. Meanwhile, Prodi shoots his bazooka at Luffy, and Luffy dodges the blasts.
Back by the food warehouse, Bonham, Zappa, and Grount see and hear the effects of the massive clash on the coast. Bonham and Zappa prepare to go to the coast and confront the pirates again, but Grount possesses no motivation to move, saying sullenly that he is too weak. Bonham and Zappa angrily berate him for his cowardice, reminding him what they had trained to do under Aokiji. Back on the coast, Luffy defeats Prodi with a Gear 2 attack, and Bonham and Zappa look on in shock as they arrive. The two Marines confront Luffy and the pirates once again, with Bonham using Qigong to increase his bulk and Zappa drawing out his swords. Meanwhile, Grount continues to sit by the food warehouse, and he whispers Aokiji's name as he recalls meeting the admiral. Several years ago, an island erupted with a shockwave as a young Grount screamed, holding a giant furry red left arm. Meanwhile, Aokiji rode toward the island on his bicycle, and as he saw the chaos on it, he decided to go there and investigate it. There, he saw Grount in the midst of the rubble of a large city, and he asked him if he caused all this damage. Grount then revealed his giant left arm and attacked Aokiji with it, being unable to control it and crying for it to be cut off. Aokiji managed to dodge his strikes and eventually incapacitated Grount by freezing his left arm. Years later, Grount trained under Aokiji with Bonham and Zappa, with his left arm now contained in a metal attachment. He asked Aokiji why he could not go out and fight yet, and the Admiral replied that he was not yet ready and he still did not have full control over his power. Aokiji then told him to keep training it in preparation for when he would face strong opponents, and in the present, Grount realizes that now might be the time Aokiji was talking about.
Back on the coast, Bonham and Zappa are defeated with Luffy's Jet Gatling, and Brook reveals that he and the Submerge are perfectly fine after Prodi's attack. Before the Sanji retrieval team can escape, however, Grount leaps out and attacks Luffy. Grount tells Bonham and Zappa to leave the fight to him as steam begins blowing out of his left arm attachment. Eventually the attachment crumbles, revealing Grount's monstrous left arm, which he now has full control over. Bonham and Zappa are ecstatic that Grount has achieved this, and Grount attacks Luffy, managing to overpower him with his left arm's sheer power. Luffy activates Gear 3, allowing him to fight on par with Grount. Grount eventually manages to send Luffy flying upward, but Luffy maintains his Haki-clad Gear 3 as he unleashes Thor Elephant Gun, and he and Grount clash with their large fists. The monstrous clash rocks the coast, and the two fighters are at a stalemate for a little while, until Luffy finally manages to gain ground. Finally, Luffy manages to overpower Grount and hit him in the face, sending him crashing down onto the beach.
Grount wakes up a little while later, with Bonham and Zappa by his side. Grount asks them where Luffy is, but they reveal that he and his crew left immediately afterwards. However, Grount just laughs, reflecting that Luffy is indeed deserving of a 500,000,000 bounty and promising with his comrades to win the next time they met the pirates. Meanwhile, the Sanji retrieval team sails away on the Thousand Sunny, but to the appall of Nami, they have already eaten all of the food they stole. Most of it was consumed by Pedro and Pekoms, who were left starving on the ship for hours, but even the crewmates who went on the island and ate there also feasted on the rations.","Prodi, Monkey D.

Episode 783,Sanji's Homecoming - Into Big Mom's Territory!,9-Apr-17,"Sanji is taken on the Queen Mama Chanter, into Big Mom's territory. Vito shows Sanji a picture of his soon-to-be fiancee, Charlotte Pudding. Nevertheless, Sanji tells Tamago and Vito that he won't be getting married. Chiffon stops an angry Gotti from mistreating Sanji, as they'd lose their heads if the 'precious groom' were to be harmed. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats struggle to survive the harsh weather and lack of nutrition.","The famished Straw Hats sail through a storm. They struggle to maintain course. Luffy states he'll save Sanji no matter what.
On the Queen Mama Chanter, Sanji notices that Tamago's transponder snail is ringing constantly. Tamago explains that the snail is receiving 'Warning Signals'. At that point, the ship passes by Tarte 28 (an outpost where a platoon of Big Mom Pirates awaits to attack any intruders). Tamago then tells Sanji not to be stubborn, and just ally with Big Mom along with Germa 66; stating it's what Sanji's father wants. Sanji angrily yells at Tamago not to speak of his father (as their relationship was cut off already), and says he only came along to bring it to an end. Tamago sips from the teacup on his head, explaining how Big Mom thinks highly of Sanji for being a chef (regardless of him being a Straw Hat). Sanji remarks how Tamago's 'people' don't care if their friends die, and says that he'll only cook for his own nakama. Tamago states that Bege was right to incapacitate Pekoms. Vito then brings over a photo he recently received from Whole Cake Island. Sanji tells them he's not getting married. Despite Sanji's threats, Vito shows him the photo of Pudding, Sanji's soon-to-be fiancee. Sanji reacts to the beautiful photo as he would upon seeing any other pretty female.
Later, Sanji walks around the ship as people stack up piles of large presents. Vito follows him, questioning Sanji on his reaction to the photo of Pudding. He then asks Sanji if he's ever read the WEJ (World Economic Journal). The WEJ features a comic called, ""Sora, Warrior of the Sea"". Vito supposes it was made to indoctrinate children on how the ""Navy is always right and strong"", and states his liking for the comic's antagonists, Germa 66. 
Sanji tells Vito not to refer to him as one of the Germa 66 members. Regardless, Vito was still happy to see Germa 66 in person. Sanji wakes up a sleeping door, demanding it open. He then walks to the room he was provided, and tells Vito to stop following him. Caesar, in a nearby cage, demands to be let out. Vito explains how they were only ordered to capture Caesar, while Sanji on the other hand was to be treated kindly (as he's the 'precious groom' who's purpose would be to unite the Charlotte Family with Germa 66). Sanji restates his unwillingness to get married, and tells Vito to get out. 'Hitman' Gotti of the Fire Tank Pirates appears. Gotti points a large machine gun at Sanji; telling him to apologize to Vito for being rude. Vito tries to persuade him it's A-OK. Sanji tells them both to get out as Vito struggles to hold back Gotti, and then goes on to say it's okay to not tolerate him as they're not friends. An angered Chiffon stomps into the room, demanding Gotti not to mistreat Sanji, lest Big Mom removes their heads. She apologizes to Sanji, then pulls Gotti out of the room by his ear. Vito leaves next, the animate door closing behind him. Sanji thinks out loud how much Chiffon resembles ""her"". Caesar, whilst crying, complains about the unfair advantage Sanji has, and the likelihood of Caesar being killed by Big Mom. 
A few days later, the hot sun beats down on the starving Straw Hats. Luffy, Brook, Pedro, and Chopper sit fishing on the edge of the Sunny; each in turn exclaiming how hot the weather is. In what little shade is on deck, Nami along with Carrot and Pekoms, beg the others to catch fish before the weather turns again. Chopper explains the slim chances of doing so, as the sea water appears to be boiling. Luffy gets a bite on  his fishing rod, and struggles to bring the very large fish out of water. He finally manages to pull up the fish, and yells, ""Let's eat!""

However, he starts eating it before Chopper discovers its skin is extremely poisonous, causing him to collapse. The Sanji Retrieval Team enters Big Mom's territory, where they come across a Germa 66 ship. They see a man on the ship who resembles Sanji, but the man reveals himself to be Sanji's younger brother Yonji, and coldly refuses the team's pleas for an antidote to save Luffy. However, Yonji's sister Reiju berates him for his attitude, kicking him off their ship before leaping onto the Thousand Sunny.","After days without food, a famished Luffy finally manages to catch something while fishing, and he excitedly brings it up. Though he initially succeeds, the giant fish falls back into the water, where it resists Luffy's attempts to pull it onto the Thousand Sunny. The Sanji Retrieval Team, in a massive effort, manages to pull the fish onto the Sunny, where they prepare to cook and eat it. Chopper notes that its color seems strange, and decides to look for information on it in Sanji's locker. Chopper manages to find a book about fish buried by several magazines with women on them, and discovers that the fish they caught has extremely poisonous skin that will cause instant death. He goes outside to tell the team about this, only to find that Luffy has already started eating the skin. Luffy feels fine, and Nami panics at the news, but Chopper tells her that they can still eat the fish if they skin it and prepare it according to Sanji's instructions.
Nami and Carrot cook the fish according to Sanji's instructions, making hearty servings for everyone on the team. They then bring it outside to serve it, and the team finds it to be delicious. However, Chopper is in a panic, as Luffy has collapsed and lost most of his functions from the skin poisoning. Nami insists that Chopper eat so he can keep taking care of Luffy, and Chopper reluctantly does so, but continues panicking and crying as he does not have the supplies necessary to treat the poisoning. They note that Luffy is still alive despite the fish's skin normally causing instant death, but they still need to get to an island and find herbs immediately. However, Pekoms warns them that they could not do this right away, as they are currently entering Big Mom's territory. Planning to stop for help at any island they come across, the Sanji Retrieval Team is delighted by the cotton candy snow falling on them. Their Den Den Mushi suddenly starts ringing, and Pekoms states that it is a signal from the Territorial Sea Slugs warning them that they are definitely in Big Mom's territory.
Suddenly, the Sanji Retrieval Team is approached by a mysterious ship, and Pekoms states that it is probably a Tarte, one of their scout ships. He has the team hide while he settles matters with the Tarte, but discovers instead that the ship belongs to Germa 66. The team barely manages to avoid crashing into the much larger ship, and a hooded man with a face resembling Sanji's approaches them, asking what they are doing here. The team mistakes him for Sanji and are overjoyed, asking him for an antidote to give to Luffy. However, the man reveals that he is not Sanji, but is actually Yonji. Yonji refuses to share the relationship between him and Sanji, but the team knows that he is obviously Sanji's younger brother. Yonji then sees Nami and becomes lovestruck, and the team is surprised at the similarities within Sanji's family. Yonji prepares to leave, and the team asks him for an antidote to save Luffy, but he coldly refuses. The team tries to get confrontational, when suddenly Yonji is kicked off his ship by his sister, who tells him to stop being so stingy.

Yonji then jumps out of the water and expresses his annoyance at his sister, Reiju, as he hovers in midair. The team is bewildered by Yonji's ability to float, and wonder if it is a Devil Fruit, but Nami says he would have been incapacitated by the water if that were the case.

Luffy sees Reiju's curly eyebrow and thinks that she is Sanji, only to be scolded by Chopper to the fact that she is a woman. After a while, Luffy realizes she is Sanji's sister, and Reiju thanks him for taking care of Sanji during his absence from their family. She reveals that their father had been looking for him since he left, and when Sanji first got a bounty two years ago, Judge sent bounty hunters after him. However, due to the crude drawing on Sanji's wanted poster, the hunters went after Duval instead, and the Straw Hats remember Duval telling them about how he had been targeted based on his resemblance to the drawing of Sanji. When Sanji's bounty was finally updated with a photograph of him, Judge pressed on with the search and had his bounty condition changed to ""Only Alive"". Luffy asks where Sanji is, and Reiju states that he is either with Big Mom or their father; they had sailed out to meet him but seemed to have missed him. Reiju looks forward to meeting him later, but Luffy angrily states his intention of rescuing Sanji. As tension builds up, Yonji notices Pekoms, and asks him what he is doing with the Straw Hats.

Pekoms tells them that it takes a day to get to Whole Cake Island from their current location, so he tells them to get groceries before they depart. Carrot notes that a large variety of races are gathered on the island, including minks. Pekoms then explains Big Mom's dream: a utopia where every race can coexist peacefully. He reveals that there are 34 islands surrounding Whole Cake Island ruled by ministers, which are all collectively known as Totto Land. The town they are in is Chocolat Town on Cacao Island, which is ruled by Minister Chocolate and is made entirely out of chocolate. Carrot asks if the chocolate can be eaten, and Pekoms affirms this, but reveals that it is illegal to consume the roofs because they protect residents against the precipitation the island gets. Pekoms tells them to come back quickly and that he will stay on the ship, but asks them to bring him back some chocolate. He then looks for Luffy so he can get into his disguise, but Carrot and Nami reveal he has already gone to explore the town, outraging Pekoms. Nami says to not worry, as they should find him easily, and her assertion is affirmed as a person cries out that someone has eaten a cafe.
In town, an angry policeman confronts the very rotund Luffy and Chopper for eating an entire cafe, but they reply that they had a good reason, which was that it was too good not to eat. The police officer angrily tells them that they are coming to the station with him, and Pedro prepares to free Luffy and Chopper by force despite Brook's pleas. Suddenly, someone comes flying down on a carpet telling the policeman to wait, and he recognizes the person as the proprietor of the cafe. A woman comes down and the policeman shows her what happened to her cafe, but she unexpectedly yells at Luffy and Chopper for not eating the entire building. She puts jam, biscuit, and chocolate in their mouths as she confirms the policeman's realization that they are actually dismantlers that she hired.

He then congratulates the owner, Charlotte Pudding, on her upcoming marriage, which makes her very happy.

Nami is surprised that Pedro knows people in this town, and Pedro says he will tell her later.
Later, the Sanji Retrieval Team eats at another cafe, and Luffy thanks Pudding for bailing them out. Pudding, however, is thankful to him for declaring her cafe to be delicious, revealing that it was made from a recipe she created from scratch. Brook cries at Pudding's generous nature as Luffy shares his love of chocolate with her, but Nami says that they cannot stay long. Pudding understands, but asks if they want tea first to wash down the chocolate. As she makes the tea, Pudding asks the Sanji Retrieval Team what their names are, and Luffy tells her who he is despite Nami futilely attempting to cover his mouth, which makes her aghast.
On Whole Cake Island, Big Mom asks how long they have before the Tea Party, and two singers respond that they have three days. The two singers also confirm that Sanji has arrived, and people continue singing as Big Mom asks about the wedding cake and its ingredients.

Meanwhile, Jinbe and Big Mom are about to enter her castle, and Jinbe recalls what happened a few hours ago, when he called all of the Sun Pirates together. Jinbe told his crew that he wished to join the Straw Hat Pirates, as he believed that Luffy out of everyone had the chance to become Pirate King. The Sun Pirates gave their support to his wish, as they had heard Jinbe talk about Luffy repeatedly for the past two years. They thanked Jinbe for his years of service to them and their kingdom, and said that he should have the chance to do something for himself for once. Jinbe was shocked at their words and bowed in gratitude, but one crew member pointed out that Big Mom might not take Jinbe's departure so well. The Sun Pirates were prepared to flee from her if things turned out for the worse, but wondered about Aladine due to his marriage to Big Mom's daughter Charlotte Praline. Praline overheard their conversation and angrily confronted her husband, believing that he was planning to leave her. However, Aladine denied this, and Praline lovingly embraced him as she declared that she would abandon her mother and go with him anywhere. Jinbe apologized to Wadatsumi for leaving him so soon, but Wadatsumi was fine since he liked the Sun Pirates. Jinbe then asked Praline if anyone had previously left Big Mom's crew, and Praline replied that people had tried it before, but no one had managed to successfully leave alive. Back in the present, Jinbe talks to Big Mom in her throne room about leaving her crew. Big Mom seems to be receptive to his request, but then states that in return for her having to lose a good subordinate like him, he will have to lose something important in return.

That night, the Sanji Retrieval Team are stranded in a sea of mizuame, which has solidified around their ship and prevented it from moving. The team is forced to melt it extremely slowly with torches, not willing to wait for daybreak due to the possibility of a horde of giant ants that they had beaten earlier returning and eating their ship. Pedro reveals that he once had a ship eaten by these ants, and the Straw Hats are curious about what he did here in the past. Carrot then reveals that Pedro used to be a pirate with Pekoms, and Pedro elaborates, explaining that the two of them sailed as explorers in search of Poneglyphs for the rulers of Zou. However, they still received bounties on their heads, and Pedro only accompanied Pekoms halfway, as he met his defeat here five years ago. The Straw Hats are surprised that he would come back here, but Pedro reveals that he is determined to help them since Inuarashi and Nekomamushi had shown them the Road Poneglyph on Zou. The only other foreigner they had shown it to was Gol D. Roger 26 years ago. The Straw Hats got to see the Road Poneglyph because they reminded the rulers of Roger, and so the minks believed they were on track to be Pirate King. Pedro points out that acquiring Big Mom's Road Poneglyph is a necessity in order to reach Laugh Tale, and offers to go in and get it while the others rescue Sanji. Luffy offers their help, but Pedro encourages them to focus on their goal, and his determination delights the team. However, the ants regain consciousness and attack the team, and they struggle to overpower the giant insects and protect the Sunny.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team is skeptical of Luffy's claim that he saw Sanji and Pudding on the beach due to not seeing the two of them, but disembark and explore the beach. They fail to see Sanji or Pudding anywhere, to their confusion, as Pudding had agreed to bring Sanji to this beach. Chopper discovers that the beach is made of hardened whipped cream, to his teammates' delight, and they then suddenly see Sanji standing by some woods in the back. They call out to him, but he does not respond as he instead runs into the woods. Confused, the team races after him into the woods. Nami is particularly confused, as she remembers Sanji promising to return during his capture on Zou. However, Luffy, Chopper, and Carrot quickly become mesmerized by the forest, which is composed mostly of candy. They decide to split up and look for Sanji, but Nami points out that they would get lost that way and they seem to be more interested in the candy lying in the paths they want to search. The team tries to deny it, but quickly get distracted by the edible nature in their path, including a melon juice river and a doughnut bridge.
Nami tries to snap them out of their distraction, but as they walk down the bridge, a giant crocodile leaps at them from underneath and takes a large bite out of the bridge they were standing on. They just barely manage to escape its jaws and prevent themselves from being eaten, and as they recover, Carrot asks Luffy if they should fight the crocodile. Luffy decides not to, and the crocodile looks at them as it decides not to eat them since they are humans before walking away on its hind legs. Nami is shocked to have seen a talking crocodile and bewildered that Luffy thought nothing of it, but Luffy points out that they already have two talking animal-like creatures with them in the form of Chopper and Carrot. Suddenly, Luffy finds himself face-to-face with a duplicate of himself, and quickly gets confrontational with it. His duplicate appears to be a mirror image of himself, perfectly reflecting all of the actions he makes and the things he says, and things like Luffy's scar and accessories have their positions reversed on the duplicate. Luffy gets angrier at his mirror duplicate and attacks it, but the duplicate perfectly matches his attacks with the same ones.
